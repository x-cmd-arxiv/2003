fireballs and resemble gamma ray burst (GRB) afterglows, yet are not
accompanied by gamma rays. Such transients may be produced by jetlike GRBs
observed off-axis, and therefore hold great promise as a test of gamma ray
burst collimation. However, orphans may also be produced by ""dirty fireballs,""
i.e., cosmological fireballs whose ejecta carry too many baryons to produce a
GRB.
  A well designed orphan afterglow search can distinguish between on-axis dirty
fireballs and off-axis orphans in at least two ways. First, by combining
real-time triggers from a wide area, multicolor search with deeper followup
observations, the light curve can be tracked for a time exceeding 2*t_1, where
t_1 is the age of the event at first observation. Such a light curve allows
simultaneous fits to t_1 and the time decay slope alpha with sufficient
accuracy to distinguish on- and off-axis orphans. Second, radio followup of
orphan afterglows will show whether the radio flux is falling in time (as
expected for an off-axis orphan) or not (as expected for on-axis events).
Additional tests involving multi-band monitoring of the cooling,
self-absorption, and f_nu peak frequencies are also possible, although much
more observationally demanding.
  A further complication in orphan searches is that dirty fireballs are likely
to also be collimated, and that collimated dirty fireballs viewed off-axis will
individually be practically indistinguishable from off-axis GRB afterglows. To
recognize their presence, orphan afterglow surveys must be sufficiently
extensive to catch at least some dirty fireballs on-axis.

interaction due to coupling of its spin with space-time curvature connection.
This gravitational interaction, which is an axial-four-vector multiplied by a
four gravitational vector potential, appears as CPT violating term in the
Lagrangian which generates an opposite sign and thus asymmetry between the
left-handed and right handed partners under CPT transformation. In the case of
neutrinos this property can generate neutrino asymmetry in the Universe. If the
background metric is of rotating black hole, Kerr geometry, this interaction
for neutrino is non-zero. Therefore the dispersion energy relation for neutrino
and its anti-neutrino are different which gives rise to the difference in their
number densities and neutrino asymmetry in the Universe in addition to the
known relic asymmetry.

a train of action potentials, or spikes. The computation performed by the
neuron can be formulated as dimensional reduction, or feature detection,
followed by a nonlinear decision function over the low dimensional space.
Generalizations of the reverse correlation technique with white noise input
provide a numerical strategy for extracting the relevant low dimensional
features from experimental data, and information theory can be used to evaluate
the quality of the low--dimensional approximation. We apply these methods to
analyze the simplest biophysically realistic model neuron, the Hodgkin--Huxley
model, using this system to illustrate the general methodological issues. We
focus on the features in the stimulus that trigger a spike, explicitly
eliminating the effects of interactions between spikes. One can approximate
this triggering ``feature space'' as a two dimensional linear subspace in the
high--dimensional space of input histories, capturing in this way a substantial
fraction of the mutual information between inputs and spike time. We find that
an even better approximation, however, is to describe the relevant subspace as
two dimensional, but curved; in this way we can capture 90% of the mutual
information even at high time resolution. Our analysis provides a new
understanding of the computational properties of the Hodgkin--Huxley model.
While it is common to approximate neural behavior as ``integrate and fire,''
the HH model is not an integrator nor is it well described by a single
threshold.

sensory inputs. The intuitive notion of functional classification is that cells
can be clustered so that most of the diversity is captured in the identity of
the clusters rather than by individuals within clusters. We show how this
intuition can be made precise using information theory, without any need to
introduce a metric on the space of stimuli or responses. Applied to the retinal
ganglion cells of the salamander, this approach recovers classical results, but
also provides clear evidence for subclasses beyond those identified previously.
Further, we find that each of the ganglion cells is functionally unique, and
that even within the same subclass only a few spikes are needed to reliably
distinguish between cells.

dark gas clouds with Av > 0.2 and masses between ~ 10^-4 and 10^-2 M_solar in
the Galactic disk or halo. However, it is possible that such dark cloud
populations could exist if they are clustered in regions away from the observed

with a matter (scalar) field which fills the universe on all stages of its

reveal themselves mainly in the form of dark matter and energy. Under the
action of the gravitational forces they decay and produce the non-baryonic dark

Ly$\alpha$ absorption spectrum transmitted flux show spiky structures. This
implies that the mass fields of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is intermittent.
This feature cannot be explained by the clustering evolution of cosmic mass
field in the linear regimes and is also difficult to incorporate into the
hierarchical clustering scenario. We calculate the structure functions and
intermittent exponent of the IGM and HI for full hydrodynamical simulation
samples. The result shows the intermittent features of the Ly$\alpha$
transmitted flux fluctuations as well as the mass field of the IGM. We find
that within the error bars of current data, all the intermittent behavior of
the simulation samples are consistent with the observation. This result is
different from our earlier result (Pando et al 2002), which shows that the
intermittent behavior of samples generated by pseudo-hydro simulation cannot be
fitted with observed data. One difference between the pseudo-hydro and full
hydro simulations is in treating the dynamical relation between the IGM (or HI)
and dark matter fields. The former assumes that the IGM density distribution
traces the underlying dark matter point-by-point on scales larger than the
Jeans length in either the linear or nonlinear regimes. However, hydrodynamic
studies have found that a statistical discrepancy between the IGM field and
underlying dark matter in nonlinear regime is possible. We find that the
point-by-point correlation between the IGM density perturbations and dark
matter become weaker on comoving scales less than 2 h$^{-1}$ Mpc (in LCDM
model), which is larger than the IGM Jeans length.

signals a phase transition to color superconductivity and its effects on the

neutrality. We calculate the quark star configurations by solving the Tolman-
Oppenheimer- Volkoff equations and obtain for the transition from a hot, normal
quark matter core of a protoneutron star to a cool diquark condensed one a
release of binding energy of the order of Delta M c^2 ~ 10^{53} erg. We find
that this energy could not serve as an engine for explosive phenomena since the
phase transition is not first order. Contrary to naive expectations the mass
defect increases when for a given temperature we neglect the possibility of
diquark condensation.

concept of space-time is the fact that spatial dimensions and time stand, as
far as their intrinsic structure is concerned, on completely different
footings: the former being represented by pencils of lines, the latter by a
pencil of conics. As a consequence, we argue that even at the classical
(macroscopic) level there exists a much more intricate and profound coupling
between space and time than that dictated by (general) relativity theory. It is
surmised that this coupling can be furnished by so-called Cremona (or
birational) transformations between two projective spaces of three dimensions,
being fully embodied in the structure of configurations of their fundamental
elements. We review properties of some of the simplest Cremona transformations
and show that the corresponding ""fundamental"" space-times exhibit an intimate
connection between the extrinsic geometry of time dimension and the
dimensionality of space. Moreover, these Cremonian space-times seem to provide
us with a promising conceptual basis for the possible reconciliation between
two extreme concepts of (space-)time, viz. physical and psychological. Some
speculative remarks in this respect are made.

lines and the boundary of the pair plasma column which is expected to develop
above the bulk of the PC. The rationale for our revision is that the proper
treatment of primary acceleration within the pulsar SGs should take into
account the effect of the narrow geometry of the gap on the electrodynamics
within the gap and also to include the effect of inertial frame dragging on the
particle acceleration. The combination of the effects of frame dragging and
geometrical screening in the gap region naturally gives rise to a regime of
extended acceleration, that is not limited to ""favorably curved"" field lines as
in earlier models, and the possibility of multiple-pair production by curvature
photons at very high altitudes, up to several stellar radii. The estimated
theoretical high-energy luminosities of the SG cascade radiation are in good
agreement with the corresponding empirical relationships for gamma-ray pulsars.
We illustrate the results of our modeling of the pair cascades and gamma-ray
emission from the high altitudes in the SG for the Crab pulsar. The combination
of the frame-dragging field and high-altitude SG emission enables both
acceleration at the smaller inclination angles and a larger emission beam, both
necessary to produce widely-spaced double-peaked profiles.

Although dSphs formed stars over extended periods, today all but one are free
of detectable interstellar matter (ISM), even in the Fornax dSph, where stars
still formed 100 Myr ago. Combining metallicities for red giants with HI data
from the literature, we show that the well-known offset in
luminosity-metallicity (L-Z) relations for dSphs and dwarf irregular (dIrr)
galaxies exists also when comparing only their old stellar populations: dSphs
have higher mean stellar metallicities for a fixed luminosity. Evidently
younger dSphs experienced more efficient enrichment than young dIrrs. Dwarf
galaxies, whose locus in the L-Z diagram is consistent with that of dSphs even
for baryonic luminosities, are the ``transition-type dwarfs'' Phoenix, DDO210,
LGS3, Antlia, and KKR25. They have mixed dIrr/dSph morphologies, low stellar
masses, low angular momentum, and HI contents of less than a few 10^6 solar
masses. Unlike dIrrs, many transition-type dwarfs would closely resemble dSphs
if their gas were removed; they are likely dSph progenitors. As gas removal is
key, we consider the empirical evidence for various gas removal processes. We
suggest that internal gas removal mechanisms are inadequate and favor ram
pressure stripping to make dSphs. A combination of initial conditions and
environment seems to support the formation of dSphs, which appear to form from
small galaxies with active early star formation, whose evolution halts due to
externally induced gas loss. Transition-type dwarfs then are dSphs that kept
their ISM, and therefore should replace dSphs in isolated locations where
stripping is ineffective. (Abridged)

broader than the RGS point-source spectral resolution; in the cross dispersion
direction the emission lines are detected adjacent to, as well as coincident
with, the active nucleus. This implies that they originate in a region of a few
arc-minutes spatial extent (1 arc-minute ~ 1 kpc in M81). The flux ratios of
the OVII triplet suggest that collisional processes are responsible for the
line emission. A good fit to the whole RGS spectrum is obtained using a model
consisting of an absorbed power law from the active nucleus and a 3 temperature
optically thin thermal plasma. Two of the thermal plasma components have
temperatures of 0.18+-0.04 keV and 0.64+-0.04 keV, characteristic of the hot
interstellar medium produced by supernovae; the combined luminosity of the
plasma at these two temperatures accounts for all the unresolved bulge X-ray
emission seen in the Chandra observation by Tennant et al. (2001). The third

velocity dispersion in this structure with the velocity dispersion of stars in
the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream, for which we measure a velocity
dispersion of 20 km/s at (l, b) = (165, -55) deg. We estimate a preliminary
metallicity from the Ca II (K) line and color of the turnoff stars of [Fe/H] =
-1.6 with a dispersion of 0.3 dex and note that the turnoff color is consistent
with that of the spheroid population. We interpret our measurements as evidence

after the core becomes fully visible. For observer directions within the core,
simple formulae are derived for the afterglow decay after the break, while for
off-core observers results are shown graphically. Some criteria for assessing
from observations the necessity of an angular structure and/or collimation are
given. Applying them to several afterglows with light-curve breaks, we find
that jets endowed with structure are required only if the circumburst medium
has a wind-like (r^{-2}) stratification. Numerical fits to the multiwavelength
emission of the afterglows 990510 and 000301c show that, for the former, the
angular distribution of the ejecta kinetic energy is not far from uniformity,
and that, with a standard power-law electron distribution, the sharp steepening
of the R-band light-curve of the latter is better accommodated by a structured
jet than an uniform outflow. Structured outflows may accommodate the shallower
light-curve breaks observed in other afterglows.

galaxies and in high-redshift star-forming galaxies. In this paper we develop a
simple analytic model to understand the observed superwind phenomenon. Our
model is built upon the model of McKee & Ostriker (1977) for the interstellar
medium. It allows one to predict how properties of a superwind, such as wind
velocity and mass outflow rate, are related to properties of its star-forming
host galaxy, such as size, gas density and star formation rate. The model
predicts a threshold of star formation rate density for the generation of
observable galactic winds. Galaxies with more concentrated star formation
produce superwinds with higher velocities. The predicted mass outflow rates are
comparable to (or slightly larger than) the corresponding star formation rates.
We apply our model to both local starburst galaxies and high-redshift Lyman
break galaxies, and find its predictions to be in good agreement with current
observations. Our model is simple, and so can be easily incorporated into
numerical simulations and semi-analytical models of galaxy formation.

natural lifetimes of such heavy objects are, however, microscopic times
associated to the GUT energy scale (sim 10^{-28} sec. or shorter); such heavy

natural they decayed shortly after being formed. The arguments produced to {\bf

XMM-Newton and Chandra low resolution spectroscopy detected significant Fe
K_alpha absorption features in the spectrum of the ultraluminous, high redshift
lensed broad absorption line QSO APM 08279+5255, yielding new insights in the
outflow geometry indicating a supersolar Fe/O ratio. Chandra high resolution
imaging spectroscopy of the nearby ULIRG/obscured QSO NGC 6240 for the first
time gave evidence of two active supermassive black holes in the same galaxy,
likely bound to coalesce in the course of the ongoing major merger in this
galaxy. Deep X-ray surveys have shown that the cosmic X-ray background (XRB) is
largely due to the accretion onto supermassive black holes, integrated over the
cosmic time. These surveys have resolved more than 80% of the X-ray background
into discrete sources. Optical spectroscopic identifications show that the
sources producing the bulk of the X-ray background are a mixture of obscured
(type-2) and unobscured (type-1) AGNs, as predicted by the XRB population
synthesis models. A class of highly luminous type-2 AGN, so called QSO-2s, has
been detected in the deepest Chandra and XMM-Newton surveys. The new Chandra
AGN redshift distribution peaks at much lower redshifts (z~0.7) than that based
on ROSAT data, indicating that the evolution of Seyfert galaxies occurs at
significantly later cosmic time than that of QSOs.

gap structure with d-wave superconductivity one can understand the data in
terms of two gaps, a very small one contributing to the nodal region and a very
large one dominating the anti-nodal region. The latter is a result of the
electronic structure observed in the undoped antiferromagnetic insulator.
Furthermore, the low energy electronic structure of the metallic sample

Lorentz structure of the Q\bar Q interaction. The observed rate for the M1
transition J/psi -> eta_c gamma is shown to provide strong evidence for a
scalar confining interaction.
  The single pion and dipion widths are calculated for the heavy-light D
mesons, by employment of the pseudovector pion-quark coupling suggested by
chiral perturbation theory. The pionic transitions D* -> D pi are shown to
provide constraining information on the pion-quark axial coupling g_A^q. It is
also shown that axial exchange charge contributions associated with the Q\bar q
interaction suppress the axial charge amplitude for pion emission by an order
of magnitude. The models for pi and M1 transitions also make it possible to
estimate the eta-nucleon coupling from the transition Ds* -> D_s pi0, once the
value of the pi^0 - eta mixing angle is known.
  Finally, the dipion transition rates of the L=1 D mesons are calculated, and
are shown to make up a significant fraction of their total widths for strong
decay. The pipi transitions between S-wave charmonium and bottomonium states
are modeled in terms of a broad sigma meson with derivative couplings to pions.

each classical vacuum leads to $\prod_i N_i$ different vacua. As the parameters
of $W(\Phi)$ are varied, these vacua change in a continuous (and holomorphic)
fashion. We find that vacua associated with $(N_1,N_2,...,N_k)$ can be
continuously transformed to vacua with $(\tilde N_1,\tilde N_2,...,\tilde
N_k)$, thus leading to a new kind of duality. Traditional order parameters,
like the Wilson loop and 't Hooft loop, sometimes distinguish different phases.
We also find phases that are not distinguished by conventional order
parameters. The whole picture of the phase diagram is reminiscent of the phase
diagram of $M$-theory.

Fermi,'' deal with two major themes. The first is the remarkable story of the
solar neutrino problem, which (along with the atmospheric neutrino anomaly)
recently led to the discovery of massive neutrinos and neutrino oscillations,
physics beyond the standard model. I will describe the physics of the standard
solar model (SSM), the experimental program that was motivated by the
discrepancies between SSM predictions and the initial observations of Raymond
Davis, Jr., and his colleagues, and the recent results of SNO and
SuperKamiokande. These first lectures end with a description of what we have
learned about neutrino oscillations and the neutrino mass matrix, as well as
the open questions (neutrino charge conjugation properties, the absolute mass
scale, CP violation) that could ultimately impact our understanding of
baryogenesis, the origin of large-scale structure, and other topics in
cosmology and astrophysics. The second theme is the core-collapse supernova
mechanism and associated nucleosynthesis. This problem connects neutrino
physics, which controls much of the nuclear physics of the star, with the
long-term chemical evolution of our galaxy. In particular, the $r$-process,
which produces about half of the heavy elements, remains poorly understood,
despite important new constraints from studies of metal-poor halo stars. The
possible role of new neutrino properties on both the explosion mechanism and
nucleosynthesis is noted.

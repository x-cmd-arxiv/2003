manifest in differing observable properties. Through deep spectroscopic and
high-resolution imaging observations of some GRB hosts, I demonstrate that
well-localized long-duration GRBs are connected with otherwise normal
star-forming galaxies at moderate redshifts of order unity. I test various
progenitor scenarios by examining the offset distribution of GRBs about their
apparent hosts, making extensive use of ground-based optical data from Keck and
Palomar and space-based imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope. The offset
distribution appears to be inconsistent with the coalescing neutron star binary
hypothesis but statistically consistent with a population of progenitors that
closely traces the ultra-violet light of galaxies. This is naturally explained
by bursts which originate from the collapse of massive stars. This claim is
further supported by the unambiguous detections of emission ''bumps'' which can
be explained as supernovae that occur at approximately the same time as the
associated GRB; if true, GRB 980326 and GRB 011121 provide strong observational
evidence connecting cosmological GRBs to high-redshift supernovae and implicate
massive stars as the progenitors of some long-duration GRBs. Interestingly,
most alternative models of these bumps require wind-stratified circumburst
media; this too, implicates massive stars. In addition to this work, I also
constructed the Jacobs Camera (JCAM), a dual-beam optical camera for the
Palomar 200-inch Telescope designed to follow-up rapid GRB localizations

clustering. The spatial distribution of galaxies can be studied as a function
of galaxy spectral type, and also of broad-band colour. Redshift-space
distortions are detected with a high degree of significance, confirming the
detailed Kaiser distortion from large-scale infall velocities, and measuring
the distortion parameter beta = Omega_m^{0.6}/b = 0.49 +- 0.09. The power
spectrum is measured to <10% accuracy for k > 0.02 h Mpc^{-1}, and is well
fitted by a CDM model with Omega_m h =0.18 +- 0.02 and a baryon fraction of
0.17 +- 0.06. A joint analysis with CMB data requires Omega_m = 0.31 +- 0.05
and h = 0.67 +- 0.04, assuming scalar fluctuations. The fluctuation amplitude
from the CMB is sigma_8 = 0.76 +- 0.04, assuming reionization at z < approx 10,
so that the general level of galaxy clustering is approximately unbiased, in
agreement with an internal bispectrum analysis. Luminosity dependence of
clustering is however detected at high significance, and is well described by a
relative bias of b/b^* = 0.85 + 0.15(L/L^*). This is consistent with the
observation that L^* in rich clusters is brighter than the global value by 0.28
+- 0.08 mag.

J(1-0)), while two of the galaxies, UGC 01922 and UGC 12289, have clear
detections in both line transitions. When these observations are combined with
all previous CO observations taken of LSB systems, we compile a total of 34
observations, in which only 3 galaxies have had detections of their molecular
gas. Comparing the LSB galaxies with and without CO detections to a sample of
high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies with CO observations indicates that it
is primarily the low density of baryonic matter within LSB galaxies which is
causing their low CO fluxes. Finally, we note that one of the massive LSB
galaxies studied in this project, UGC 06968 (a Malin-1 `cousin'), has upper
limits placed on both M_H2 and M_H2/M_HI which are 10-20 times lower than the
lowest values found for any galaxy (LSB or HSB) with similar global properties.
This may be due to an extremely low temperature and metallicity within UGC

to be detected by the IRAM beam.

observations made using the new On-The-Fly mapping mode with the FCRAO 14m
telescope, and find no evidence for CO emission associated with the dust arch.
Our examination of previously published HI data shows that if previous
assumptions about the dust temperature and gas/dust ratio are correct, then
there must be molecular gas associated with the arch, below our detection
threshold. If this is true, then the molecular mass associated with the dust
arch is between 1.5 x 10^8 M(sun)and 9.7 x 10^8 M(sun), and likely towards the
low end of the range. A consequence of this is that the maximum allowed value
for the CO-to-H_2 conversion factor is 6.5 times the Galactic value, but most
likely closer to the Galactic value. The kinematics of the HI apparently
associated with the dust arch reveal that the gas here is not part of an
expanding shell or outflow, but is instead two separate features (a tidal arm
and a plume of HI sticking out into the halo) which are seen projected together
and appear as a shell. Thus there is no connection between the dust ""arch"" and
the hot X-ray emitting gas that appears to surround the galaxy Wang et al.

covering both the core (high density) and outskirts (intermediate to low

galaxies, of which, 760 galaxies are confirmed members of the Coma cluster. A
statistical technique is developed to correct the spectroscopic sample for
incompletness. The corrected sample is then used to construct R-band luminosity
function (LF) spanning a range of 7 magnitudes (-23 < M_R < -16) both at the
core and outskirts of the cluster.
  Dependence of the LF on local environment in Coma is explored. The LFs are
found to be the same, within the errors, between the inner and outer regions
and close to those from recent measurements for field galaxies. The total
B-band LF for the Coma cluster, fitted to a Schecter form is also measured and
shows a dip at M(B) = -18 mag., in agreement with previous studies. The
implications of this feature are discussed.
  The LF is studied in B-R color intervals and shows a steep faint-end slope
for red (B-R > 1.35) galaxies, both at the core and outskirts of the cluster.
This population of low luminosity red galaxies has a higher surface density
than the blue (B-R < 1.35) star-forming population, dominating the faint-end of

brightness galaxies is larger at the cluster core, implying destruction of low
surface brightness galaxies in dense core environment.

far-infrared and submillimeter polarization results to find that the direction
of the inferred magnetic field is related to the density of the molecular
material in the following way: in denser regions, the field is generally
parallel to the Galactic plane, whereas in regions with lower densities, the
field is generally perpendicular to the plane. This finding is consistent with
a model in which an initially poloidal field has been sheared into a toroidal
configuration in regions that are dense enough such that the gravitational
energy density is greater than the energy density of the magnetic field. Using
this model, we estimate the characteristic strength of the magnetic field in
the central 30 pc of our Galaxy to be a few mG.

focus in this paper on the gas distribution and M-T relation. In addition to
clusters and groups, our sample includes two early-type galaxies, carefully
selected to avoid contamination from group or cluster X-ray emission. We
compare the properties of these objects with those of more massive systems and
find evidence for a systematic difference between galaxy-sized haloes and
groups of a similar temperature. We derive a mean logarithmic slope of the M-T
relation within R_200 of 1.84+/-0.06, although there is some evidence of a
gradual steepening in the M-T relation, with decreasing mass. We recover a
similar slope using two additional methods of calculating the mean temperature.
Repeating the analysis with the assumption of isothermality, we find the slope
changes only slightly, to 1.89+/-0.04, but the normalization is increased by
30%. Correspondingly, the mean gas fraction within R_200 changes from
(0.13+/-0.01)h70^-1.5 to (0.11+/-0.01)h70^-1.5, for the isothermal case, with
the smaller fractional change reflecting different behaviour between hot and
cool systems. There is a strong correlation between the gas fraction within
0.3*R_200 and temperature. This reflects the strong (5.8 sigma) trend between
the gas density slope parameter, beta, and temperature, which has been found in
previous work. (abridged)

coherent acoustic field obeys a loaded string equation. The driven force has
contributions from the piezoelectric and deformation potential couplings. We
applied the theory to model the generation of coherent longitudinal acoustic
phonons in (0001)-oriented InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells. The numerical
results are in good agreement with the experimental ones. By using the
macroscopic theory, we also investigated the crystal-orientation effects on the
generation of coherent acoustic phonons in wurtzite multiple quantum wells. It
was found that coherent transverse acoustic phonons dominate the generation for
certain orientation angles.

  Abstract For underdoped cuprate HTSC we discuss the supposition that both the
pseudogap (PG) and supercoducting (SC) states result from dynamical dimension
reduction when HTSC behaves on cooling if its dimensionality is changed. It is
shown that the transition to the PG state occurs at the temperature T* as
dimensional crossover when charges motion changes from the three dimensional
(3D) to two-dimensional (2D). Namely two-dimensionality at T*>T is responsible
for the crucial role of Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions which bound up with holes
and form delocalized JT polarons and the localized three spin polarons in
copper-oxygen planes that removes the competition between pairing carriers and
their localization. At the cooling T*>T the SC transition occurs at Tc as a
sequence of the crossovers from zero-dimensional to 2D SC fluctuations, and
then to the 3D SC fluctuations. Some experimental evidence of the local hole-JT
polaron pairs and dynamical dimension reduction in the PG and SC states are
discussed.

formed in relativistic heavy ion collision (RHIC) experiments are investigated
with a view to disentangle the effects of thermal motion and the phase space of
decay products from those of intrinsic changes in the structure of resonances
at the freeze-out conditions. Analytic results of peak mass shifts for the
cases of both equal and unequal mass decay products are derived. The shift is
expressed in terms of the peak mass and width of the vacuum or medium-modified
spectral functions and temperature. Examples of expected shifts in meson (e.g.,
rho, omega, and sigma) and baryon (e.g., Delta) resonances that are helpful to
interpret recent RHIC measurements at BNL are provided. Although significant
downward mass shifts are caused by widened widths of the $\rho-$meson in
medium, a downward shift of at least 50 MeV in its intrinsic mass is required
to account for the reported downward shift of 60-70 MeV in the peak of the
rho-invariant mass distribution. An observed downward shift from the vacuum
peak value of the Delta distinctively signals a significant downward shift in
its intrinsic peak mass, since unlike for the rho-meson, phase space functions
produce an upward shift for the Delta isobar.

reservoir requires theoretically two copies of the position coordinate within
the reduced density matrix description. One coordinate moves forward in time
while the other coordinate moves backward in time. It is shown that quantum
dissipation induces, in the plane of the forward and backward motions, a
noncommutative geometry. The noncommutative geometric plane is a consequence of
a quantum dissipation induced phase interference which is closely analogous to
the Aharanov-Bohm effect.

quantum system to any target state, while maintaining quantum coherence
throughout the process. The control is illustrated by a realistic simulation
for both adiabatic and thermal decoherence. In the thermal decoherence regime,
the control achieved by the proposed scheme is qualitatively similar, at the
ensemble level, to the control realized by the quantum feedback scheme of Wang,
Wiseman, and Milburn [Phys. Rev. A 64, #063810 (2001)] for the spontaneous
emission of a two-level atom. The performance of the open-loop scheme compares
favorably against the quantum feedback scheme with respect to robustness,
target fidelity and transition times.

unsorted search problem, whereupon Bruschweiler's ensemble search algorithm is
applied. For adequate sensitivities of the measurement technique, the query
complexity of the ensemble search algorithm depends linearly on the size of the
function's domain. Advantages and limitations of an eventual NMR implementation
are discussed.

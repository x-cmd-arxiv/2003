shape to shear distortion in current weak lensing analysis methods. Such
overall calibration biases cannot be detected by the standard tests such as E/B
decomposition or calibration with stars. We find that the non-Gaussianity of
point spread function has a significant effect and can lead to up to 15 per
cent error on the linear amplitude of fluctuations sigma_8 depending on the
method of analysis. This could explain some of the discrepancies seen in recent
amplitude determinations from weak lensing. Using an elliptical Laguerre
expansion method we develop a re-Gaussianization method which reduces the error
to calibration error of order 1 per cent even for poorly resolved galaxies. We
also discuss a new type of shear selection bias which results in up to roughly
8 percent underestimation of the signal. It is expected to scale with redshift,
inducing errors in the growth factor extraction if not properly corrected for.
Understanding and correcting for such effects is crucial if weak lensing is to
become a high precision probe of cosmology.

obtained in the Ha-line. The studied galaxies represent a rather mixed sample:
from very low luminosity irregular galaxies, like VV 499 (DDO 053), to rather
bright VV 523 (NGC 3991). Their metallicities vary from Z=1/25 Zo for VV 499 to
1/2 Zo for VV 523. The morphology of these galaxies ranges between typical dIrr

large-scale ionized gas outflows/supershells around the sites of intense

several hundred pc to about 2 kpc. For all studied galaxies we examine their

capability have enabled milliarcsecond-scale imaging of radio sources at
sub-millijansky sensitivity, opening the door to high-resolution imaging of
Seyfert galaxies. Over the last few years, this has led to a number of
interesting new results that shed light on the characteristics of the inner
cores of Seyfert galaxies. These include the following: (1) classical Seyfert
galaxies with steep radio spectra have a strong tendency to exhibit radio jets
at milliarcsecond scales, sometimes with considerable curvature in the jets;
(2) apparent speeds of jets imaged at multiple epochs generally are
considerably less than c, often in the vicinity of 0.1c or less, although there
sometimes are faster motions seen after strong outbursts; and (3) lower
luminosity Seyfert galaxies have a much stronger tendency to show flat or
somewhat inverted radio spectra, usually are unresolved on milliarcsecond
scales, and probably are dominated by a combination of low-radiative-efficiency
accretion flows and very compact radio jets. This paper discusses some examples
that illustrate these properties, and summarizes some of what we have learned
about weak active galaxies on milliarcsecond scales.

"cond-mat/0301039","Oksana Patsahan","O.V.Patsahan","Critical behaviour of ionic fluids","14 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft",,"  Recently we proposed a microscopic approach to the description of the phase
behaviour and critical phenomena in binary fluid mixtures. It was based on the
method of collective variables (CV) with a reference system. The approach
allowed us to obtain the functional of the Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson (GLW)
Hamiltonian expressed in terms of the CV (fluctuating densities). The
corresponding set of CV included the variable connected with the order
parameter. In this paper we use this approach to the study of the critical
behaviour of ionic fluids. For the restricted primitive model (RPM) we obtain
the functional of the grand partition function in the phase space of the two
fluctuating fields conjugate to the fluctuating densities. First we calculate
the phase diagram of the RPM in the mean-field (MF) approximation and then we
do this calculation taking into account the terms of the higher orders in the
effective Hamiltonian. In the both cases the phase diagrams demonstrate the
gas-liquid (GL) and charge ordering phase instabilities. In the latter case,
the obtained value for the GL critical temperature is in good agreement with
the MC simulation data whereas the critical density is underestimated. The
explicit expression found for the grand thermodynamic potential in the vicinity
of the GL critical point implies a classical critical behaviour of the RPM.

the quasi-particle spectra of odd deformed nuclei have been calculated in a
fully self-consistent way within the framework of the relativistic mean field
(RMF) theory. The energies of the spherical subshells, from which active
deformed states of these nuclei emerge, are described with an accuracy better
than 0.5 MeV for most of the subshells with the NL1 and NL3 parametrizations.
However, for a few subshells the discrepancies reach 0.7-1.0 MeV. In very heavy
systems, where the level density is high, this level of accuracy is not
sufficient for reliable predictions of the location of relatively small
deformed shell gaps. The calculated moments of inertia reveal only small
sensitivity to the RMF parametrization and, thus, to differences in the
single-particle structure. However, in contrast to lighter systems, it is
necessary to decrease the strength of the D1S Gogny force in the pairing
channel in order to reproduce the moments of inertia.

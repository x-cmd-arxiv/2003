MAMA observations, and ground-based optical observations of GRB010222, spanning
15 hrs to 71 days. The observations are well-described by a relativistic
blast-wave model with a hard electron-energy distribution, p = 1.57, and a jet
transition at t_j=0.93 days. These values are slightly larger than previously
found as a result of a correction for the contribution from the host galaxy to
the late-time ground-based observations and the larger temporal baseline
provided by the Hubble Space Telescope observations. The host galaxy is found
to contain a very compact core (size <0.25 arcsec) which coincides with the
position of the optical transient. The STIS near ultraviolet MAMA observations
allow for an investigation of the extinction properties along the line of sight
to GRB010222. We find that the far ultraviolet curvature component (c_4) is
rather large. In combination with the low optical extinction A_V =0.11 mag,
when compared to the Hydrogen column inferred from X-ray observations, we
suggest that this is evidence for dust destruction.

pressure dominated (high beta) and magnetically dominated (low beta) plasmas at
different Mach numbers. In addition, we present results for superAlfvenic
turbulence and discuss in what way it is similar to the subAlfvenic turbulence.
We describe a technique of separating different magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes
(slow, fast and Alfven) and apply it to our simulations. We show that, for both
high and low beta cases, Alfven and slow modes reveal the Kolmogorov spectrum
(index=-5/3) and scale-dependent Goldreich-Sridhar anisotropy, while fast modes
exhibit spectrum with index=-3/2 and isotropy. We discuss the statistics of
density fluctuations arising from MHD turbulence at different regimes. Our
findings entail numerous astrophysical implications ranging from cosmic ray
propagation to gamma ray bursts and star formation. In particular, we show that
the rapid decay of turbulence reported by earlier researchers is not related to
compressibility and mode coupling in MHD turbulence. In addition, we show that
magnetic field enhancements and density enhancements are marginally correlated.
Addressing the density structure of partially ionized interstellar gas on AU
scales, we show that the new regime of MHD turbulence that we earlier reported
for incompressible flows persists for compressible turbulence and therefore may
provide an explanation for those mysterious structures.

stellar astrophysics. However, only few if any of these are found as single
stars, on average massive stars have more than one companion. Many of them are
born in dense stellar clusters and several clusters have an excess of massive
short-period spectroscopic binaries, with severe implication for binary-related
stellar evolution including mergers, and also for the origin of massive runaway
stars. The multiplicity of massive stars seems to increase with increasing
primary mass and with increasing density of young star clusters. These
observations suggest that massive binary and multiple systems originate mainly
from dynamical gravitational interactions and accretion-induced protostellar
collisions in dense clusters. If true, the binary properties of massive stars
in less dense OB associations should be less extreme. This prediction should be
tested by future observations.The paper reviews both the latest observations

with a speculation on how the binary properties might change with metallicity

coarsening of domains following a deep quench below the spinodal point from a

average domain size growing with time as $t^\gamma$, where $\gamma$ increases
in the range $0.545 < \gamma < 0.717$, consistent with a crossover between
diffusive $t^{1/3}$ and hydrodynamic viscous, $t^{1.0}$, behaviour. We find
good collapse onto a single scaling function, yet the domain growth exponents
differ from others' works' for similar values of the unique characteristic
length and time that can be constructed out of the fluid's parameters. This
rebuts claims of universality for the dynamical scaling hypothesis. At early
times, we also find a crossover from $q^2$ to $q^4$ in the scaled structure
function, which disappears when the dynamical scaling reasonably improves at
later times. This excludes noise as the cause for a $q^2$ behaviour, as
proposed by others. We also observe exponential temporal growth of the
structure function during the initial stages of the dynamics and for
wavenumbers less than a threshold value.

is argued that the Jahn-Teller effect, considered to be crucial for the region

with moderate to large band-width. The anisotropic hopping across the
degenerate $e_g$ orbitals are crucial in understanding the ground state phases
of this region, an observation emphasized earlier by Brink and Khomskii. Based
on calculations using a realistic limit of finite Hund's coupling, we show that
the inclusion of interactions stabilizes th e C-phase, the antiferromagnetic
metallic A-phase moves closer to $x=0.5$ while th e ferromagnetic phase shrinks
in agreement with recent observations. The charge ordering close to $x=0.5$ and

For this scenario, it has been shown that, when the bulk charge is
non-vanishing, a singularity-free ``bounce'' universe will always be obtained.
However, for the physically relevant case of a de Sitter brane world, we have
recently argued that, from a holographic (c-theorem) perspective, such brane
worlds may not be physically viable. In the current paper, we reconsider the
validity of such models by appealing to the so-called ``causal entropy bound''.
In this framework, a paradoxical outcome is obtained: these brane worlds are
indeed holographically viable, provided that the bulk charge is not too small.
We go on to argue that this new finding is likely the more reliable one.

acting in a Hilbert bundle, which is a generalization of the known Bargmann's
theory. With the help of it we have reformulated the standard quantum theory
such that the gauge freedom emerges naturally from the very nature of quantum
laws. The theory is of primary importance in the investigations of covariance
(in contradistinction to symmetry) of a quantum theory which possesses a
nontrivial gauge freedom. In that case the group in question is not any
symmetry group but it is a covariance group only - that case which has not been
deeply investigated. It is shown on the paper that the factor of its
representation depends on space and time when the system in question possesses
a gauge freedom. In the nonrelativistic theories the factor depends on the time
only. In the relativistic theory the Hilbert bundle is over the spacetime in
the nonrelativistic one it is over the time.
  We explain two applications of this generalization: in a theory of a quantum
particle in the nonrelativistic limit and in the quantum electrodynamics.

$k[\Delta]^+$ is (the direct image to $B$ of) the constant sheaf on the

  We have $H^i(B, M^+) = [H^{i+1}_m(M)]_0$ for all $i > 0$. The
Poincare-Verdier duality for sheaves $M^+$ on $B$ corresponds to the local
duality for squarefree modules over $S$. For example, if $|\Delta|$ is a
manifold, then $k[\Delta]$ is a Buchsbaum ring whose canonical module is a
squarefree module giving the orientation sheaf of $|\Delta|$ with the
coefficients in $k$.

interaction with the outer region by mapping the problem on the dynamical
characterization of localized perturbations. This latter task is performed by
suitably generalizing the concept of Lyapunov spectrum to cope with
perturbations that propagate outside the region under investigation. As a
result, we are able to introduce a ""volume""-propagation velocity, i.e. the
velocity with which ensembles of localized perturbations tend to fill volumes
in the neighbouring regions.

non-integrable systems. The significant role of complex-phase-space chaos in
the description of the tunneling process is elucidated by studying a simple
scattering map model. Behaviors of tunneling orbits are encoded into symbolic
sequences based on the structure of complex homoclinic tanglement. By means of
the symbolic coding, the phase space itineraries of tunneling orbits are
related with the amounts of imaginary parts of actions gained by the orbits, so
that the systematic search of significant tunneling orbits becomes possible.

  version with a significantly reduced quality of the figures. The original
  version has been submitted to Physical Review E",,,,"physics.bio-ph q-bio",,"  A versatile approach to modeling the conformations and energetics of DNA
loops is presented. The model is based on the classical theory of elasticity,
modified to describe the intrinsic twist and curvature of DNA, the DNA bending
anisotropy, and electrostatic properties. All the model parameters are
considered to be functions of the loop arclength, so that the DNA
sequence-specific properties can be modeled. The model is applied to the test
case study of a DNA loop clamped by the lac repressor protein. Several
topologically different conformations are predicted for various lengths of the
loop. The dependence of the predicted conformations on the parameters of the
problem is systematically investigated. Extensions of the presented model and
the scope of the model's applicability, including multi-scale simulations of
protein-DNA complexes and building all-atom structures on the basis of the
model, are discussed.

[2002]
on the hyperinflations of Germany (1920/1/1-1923/11/1), Hungary
(1945/4/30-1946/7/15), Brazil (1969-1994), Israel (1969-1985), Nicaragua
(1969-1991), Peru (1969-1990) and Bolivia (1969-1985). On the basis of a
generalization of Cagan's model of inflation based on the mechanism of
``inflationary expectation'' or positive feedbacks between realized growth rate
and people's expected growth rate, we find that hyperinflations can be
characterized by a power law singularity culminating at a critical time $t_c$.
Mizuno et al.'s double-exponential function can be seen as a discrete time-step
approximation of our more general nonlinear ODE formulation of the price
dynamics which exhibits a finite-time singular behavior. This extension of
Cagan's model, which makes natural the appearance of a critical time $t_c$, has
the advantage of providing a well-defined end of the clearly unsustainable
hyperinflation regime. We find an excellent and reliable agreement between
theory and data for Germany, Hungary, Peru and Bolivia. For Brazil, Israel and
Nicaragua, the super-exponential growth seems to be already contaminated
significantly by the existence of a cross-over to a stationary regime.

is of importance to understand how much of entanglement particular quantum

to use proper measures of entanglement which have nice properties. One of the
major candidates of such measures is ""entanglement of formation"", and whether
this measurement is additive or not is an important open problem. We aim at
certain states so-called ""antisymmetric states"" for which the additivity are

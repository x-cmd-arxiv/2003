wavelet band powers. Current cosmological data correspond to 11 such wavelet
bands. We derive constraints on these band powers as well as $H_0$, $\Omega_b

pre--protostellar phase of massive star formation. These cores were selected to
be quiescent, i.e. they contain no apparent IR sources and are not associated
with any molecular outflows. These cores are one order of magnitude more
massive than dark cloud cores and have about twice the line width. This paper
focuses on their temperature structure. We find a statistically significant
correlation between the gas kinetic temperature and the gas column density. The
general trend is for the gas to be colder where the column density is higher,
which we interpret to mean that the interiors of these cores are colder than
the regions surrounding them. This is in contrast with dark cloud cores, which
exhibit relatively flat temperature profiles. The temperature gradient within
the massive quiescent Orion cores is consistent with an external radiation
source heating the dust, and dust--gas collisions providing relatively close
coupling between dust and gas temperatures. From linewidth and temperature, we
also obtained the spatial distribution of the turbulence. An anticorrelation is
found between the intensity of emission and the degree of turbulence. Thus, we
suggest that the initial stage of massive pre--protostellar cloud cores is
relatively quiescent condensations which are cooler than their surroundings.

Galaxy Survey. We present an improved technique for the numerical inversion of
Limber's equation that relates the angular clustering of galaxies to an
integral over the power spectrum in three dimensions. Our approach is
underpinned by a large ensemble of mock galaxy catalogues constructed from the
Hubble Volume N-body simulations. The mock catalogues are used to test for
systematic effects in the inversion algorithm and to estimate the errors on our
measurement. We find that we can recover the power spectrum to an accuracy of
better than 15% over three decades in wavenumber. A key advantage of the use of
mock catalogues to infer errors is that we can apply our technique on scales
for which the density fluctuations are not Gaussian, thus probing the regime
that offers the best constraints on models of galaxy formation. On large
scales, our measurement of the power spectrum is consistent with the shape of
the mass power spectrum in the popular ``concordance'' cold dark matter model.
The galaxy power spectrum on small scales is strongly affected by nonlinear
evolution of density fluctuations, and, to a lesser degree, by galaxy bias. The
rms variance in the galaxy distribution, when smoothed in spheres of radius 8
h^(-1)Mpc, is sigma^g_8=0.96^(+0.17)_(-0.20) and the shape of the power
spectrum on large scales is described by a simple fitting formula with
parameter Gamma= 0.19^(+0.13)_(-0.04) (these errors are the 1-sigma ranges for
a two parameter fit). We use our measurement of the power spectrum to estimate
the galaxy two point correlation function; the results are well described by a

flanking fields, the color selection criteria are chosen so that LBGs are
picked out most efficiently and least contaminated by foreground objects. The
numbers of LBG candidates detected are 310 in 23.0 < I_c < 25.5. The rest-frame
UV luminosity function(LF) of LBGs at z ~ 5 is derived statistically. The
fraction of contamination is estimated to be ~50% in the faintest magnitude

and ~20% in the faintest magnitude range (25.0 < I_c <= 25.5). The LF of LBG
candidates at z ~ 5 does not show a significant difference from those at z ~ 3
and 4, though there might be a slight decrease in the fainter part. The UV
luminosity density within the observational limit is 0.56 - 0.69 times smaller
than that obtained for LBGs at z ~ 3, depending on the adopted cosmology and
the integration range of the LF. The similarity of the LFs at redshifts 5 to 3
implies that most of LBGs at z ~ 5 should have faded out at z ~ 3 and LBGs at z
\~ 5 are different galaxies from those seen at z ~ 3, if we take face values
for ages of the LBGs at z ~ 3 obtained by the SED fitting in which a continuous
star formation in an individual galaxy is assumed. However, if the star
formation in LBGs is sporadic, the similarity of the LF at z ~ 3 and 5 would be
explained. Such sporadic star formation has been suggested by hydrodynamical
simulations and semi-analytic models with collisional starbursts, and the trend
of the cosmic star formation history predicted by these studies resembles to

global support, it nevertheless produces density enhancements that allow local

era', at z ~ 2-3, but these sources are only detectable for small fractions of

inverse Compton losses against the cosmic microwave background. Using recent
models for the evolution of the size and luminosity of powerful double radio
sources, as well as LCDM simulations of the cosmic web of baryonic material, we
argue that during the quasar era a high volume fraction of this web was
occupied by the lobes of double radio sources. They could have seeded the IGM
with an average magnetic field approaching 10^{-8} G. Further, these advancing
overpressured lobes could compress the denser interstellar gas clouds of the
galaxies engulfed by them and thus trigger starbursts. This can probably
account for much of the intense star-formation activity witnessed beyond z ~
1.5. Also, the sweeping up of the ISM of the gas-rich galaxies by the rapidly
advancing radio lobes may well be responsible for the widespread metal
pollution of the IGM and proto-galaxies at high redshifts.

these systems are tight (separation <5 AU) and have similar masses (Delta
Ks<0.8 mag; 0.85<q<1.0). We find a sensitivity corrected binary fraction in the
range 15+/-7% for M8.0-L0.5 stars with separations >2.6 AU. This is slightly
less than the 32+/-9% measured for more massive M0-M4 dwarfs over the same
separation range (Fischer & Marcy 1992). It appears M8.0-L0.5 binaries (as well
as L and T dwarf binaries) have a much smaller semi-major axis distribution
peak (~4 AU) than early M binaries. We also find no VLM binary systems (defined
here as systems with M_tot<0.185 solar masses) with separations >15 AU.
  We briefly explore possible reasons why VLM binaries are slightly less
common, nearly equal mass, and much more tightly bound compared to more massive
binaries. We find that a kick during the ejection of a forming VLM binary from
a close triple or quadruple encounter (imparting a differential kick of ~3 km/s
between the members of the binary) could reproduce the observed cut-off in the
semi-major axis distribution at ~20 AU. However, the estimated binarity (~<5%;
Bate et al. 2002) produced by such ""ejection scenarios"" is below the 9-15%
observed. Similarly, the dynamical decay models of Sterzik & Durisen (1998);
Durisen, Sterzik, & Pickett (2001) also cannot produce a VLM binary fraction
above ~5%. Our estimate of a fragmentation-produced VLM binary semi-major axis
distribution contains a significant fraction of ``wide'' VLM binaries with a>20

needed to explain this very interesting VLM binary population.

problem of Riemannian quantum gravity is studied for positive-definite regular
solutions of the Einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant
within biaxial Bianchi-IX metrics containing bolts, i.e., within the family of
Taub-Bolt-anti-de Sitter (Taub-Bolt-AdS) metrics. Such metrics are obtained
from the two-parameter Taub-NUT-anti-de Sitter family. The condition of
regularity requires them to have only one free parameter ($L$) and constrains
$L$ to take values within a narrow range; the other parameter is determined as
a double-valued function of $L$ and hence there is a bifurcation within the
family. We found that {\it{any}} axially symmetric $S^3$-boundary can be filled
in with at least one solution coming from each of these two branches despite
the severe limit on the permissible values of $L$. The number of infilling
solutions can be one, three or five and they appear or disappear
catastrophically in pairs as the values of the two radii of $S^3$ are varied.
The solutions occur simultaneously in both branches and hence the total number
of independent infillings is two, six or ten. We further showed that when the
two radii are of the same order and large the number of solutions is two. In
the isotropic limit this holds for small radii as well. These results are to be
contrasted with the one-parameter self-dual Taub-NUT-AdS infilling solutions of
the same boundary-value problem studied previously.

Taub-Bolt infillings are double-valued whereas Taub-Nut and Eguchi-Hanson
infillings are unique. In the case of trivial bundles, there are two
Schwarzschild infillings in arbitrary dimensions. The condition of whether a
particular type of filling in is possible can be expressed as a limitation on
squashing through a functional dependence on dimension in each case. The case
of the Eguchi-Hanson metric is solved in arbitrary dimension. The Taub-Nut and
the Taub-Bolt are solved in four dimensions and methods for arbitrary dimension
are delineated. For the case of Schwarzschild, analytic formulae for the two
infilling black hole masses in arbitrary dimension have been obtained. This
should facilitate the study of black hole dynamics/thermodynamics in higher
dimensions. We found that all infilling solutions are convex. Thus convexity of
the boundary does not guarantee uniqueness of the infilling. Isoperimetric
inequalities involving the volume of the boundary and the volume of the
infilling solutions are then investigated. In particular, the analogues of

respect to maximum electron transparency and minimum ion feedback. We report on
the charge transfer behaviour and the achievable gas gain of this device. A
three-dimensional electron and ion transfer simulation is compared to results
derived from electric current measurements. Similarly, we present studies of
the charge transfer behaviour of a GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) by current
measurements and simulations. Finally, we investigate the combination of the
MicroCAT and the GEM by measurements with respect to the performance at
different voltage settings, gas mixtures and gas pressures.

We find that the tail of $P(S)$ is also asymptotically a modified Weibull

with different functional forms depending on the super- or sub-exponential

quantum computing rely on nearest neighbor interactions, there is a hidden
quantum communication overhead to connect distant nodes of the computer. In
this paper we propose a physical solution to this problem which, together with
the key building blocks, provides a pathway to a scalable quantum architecture
using nonlocal interactions. Our solution involves the concept of a quantum bus
that acts as a refreshable entanglement resource to connect distant memory
nodes providing an architectural concept for quantum computers analogous to the
von Neumann architecture for classical computers.

strategies, which can help improve outcomes for the participants. With many
players, such quantum games can involve entanglement among many states which is
difficult to implement, especially if the states must be communicated over some
distance. This paper describes a quantum mechanism for the economically
significant $n$-player public goods game that requires only two-particle
entanglement and is thus much easier to implement than more general quantum
mechanisms. In spite of the large temptation to free ride on the efforts of
others in this game, two-particle entanglement is sufficient to give near
optimal expected payoff when players use a simple mixed strategy for which no
player can benefit by making different choices. This mechanism can also address
some heterogeneous preferences among the players.

mixed state in any system more complicated than two qubits. This paper, via a
relatively straightforward generalization of Wootters' original derivation,
obtains a closed form lower bound on the EOF of an arbitary mixed state of a
system composed of a qubit and a qudit (a d-level quantum system, with d
greater than or equal to 3). The derivation of the lower bound is detailed for
a system composed of a qubit and a qutrit (d = 3); the generalization to d
greater than 3 then follows readily.

explained by invoking the ``collapse of the wave function.'' This is a rather
mysterious idea; it would be better to explain the Stern-Gerlach results
without using it. We re-analyze the Stern-Gerlach experiment using path
integrals. We find if we model explicitly the finite width of the beam,
coherent interference within the beam itself provides the space quantization --
without need to invoke the collapse. If we insist on employing only wave
functions with the space and spin parts kept forcibly disentangled, we recreate
the need to invoke the collapse. The collapse-free approach makes more specific
predictions about the shape and position of the scattered beams; if the
interaction region has finite length, these may be testable. Pending
experimental disambiguation, the chief arguments in favor of the collapse-free
approach are that it is simpler and less mysterious, has no adjustable
parameters, and requires the invocation of no new forces.

number of new inequalities, not present in the two-beam case, one of them
coinciding with a recently proposed multibeam generalization of the inequality
found by Greenberger and YaSin. We show, by an explicit procedure of
optimization in a three-beam case, that suggested generalizations of Englert's
inequality, do not convey, differently from the two-beam case, the idea of
complementarity, according to which an increase of visibility is at the cost of
a loss in path information, and viceversa.

  edited by Katherine Brading and Elena Castellani, Cambridge University Press,
  2003",,,,"quant-ph",,"  \noindent In our contribution to this volume we deal with \emph{discrete}
symmetries: these are symmetries based upon groups with a discrete set of
elements (generally a set of elements that can be enumerated by the positive
integers). In physics we find that discrete symmetries frequently arise as
`internal', non-spacetime symmetries. Permutation symmetry is such a discrete
symmetry arising as the mathematical basis underlying the statistical behaviour
of ensembles of certain types of indistinguishable quantum particle (e.g.,
fermions and bosons). Roughly speaking, if such an ensemble is invariant under
a permutation of its constituent particles (i.e., permutation symmetric) then
one doesn't `count' those permutations which merely `exchange'
indistinguishable particles; rather, the exchanged state is identified with the
original state. This principle of invariance is generally called the
`indistinguishability postulate' [IP], but we prefer to use the term
`permutation invariance' [PI]. It is this symmetry principle that is typically
taken to underpin and explain the nature of (fermionic and bosonic) quantum
statistics (although, as we shall see, this characterisation is not
uncontentious), and it is this principle that has important consequences
regarding the metaphysics of identity and individuality for particles
exhibiting such statistical behaviour.

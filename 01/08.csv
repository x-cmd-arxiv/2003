double-barred galaxies that exhibit a variety of molecular gas morphologies to
determine if the molecular gas properties are correlated with the nuclear
morphology and star forming activity. Near infrared galaxy surveys have
revealed the existence of nuclear stellar bars in a large number of barred or
lenticular galaxies. High resolution CO maps of these galaxies exhibit a wide
range of morphologies. Recent simulations of double-barred galaxies suggest
that variations in the gas properties may allow it to respond differently to
similar gravitational potentials. We find that the 12CO J=3-2/J=2-1 line ratio
is lower in galaxies with centrally concentrated gas distributions and higher
in galaxies with CO emission dispersed around the galactic center in rings and
peaks. The 13CO/12CO J=2-1 line ratios are similar for all galaxies, which
indicates that the J=3-2/J=2-1 line ratio is tracing variations in gas
temperature and density, rather than variations in optical depth. There is
evidence that the galaxies which contain more centralized CO distributions are
comprised of molecular gas that is cooler and less dense. Observations suggest
that the star formation rates are higher in the galaxies containing the warmer,
denser, less centrally concentrated gas. It is possible that either the bar
dynamics are responsible for the variety of gas distributions and densities
(and hence the star formation rates) or that the star formation alone is
responsible for modifying the gas properties.

The X-ray spectra of both sources are better fitted by a double power-law
model, with a steep soft X-ray component flattening at harder energies, with
breaks at 0.3 and 1.5 keV, respectively. The concave shape of the spectra in
both objects is consistent with soft X-rays being produced by the synchrotron

properties confirm this scenario, in particular for S5 0716+714 our observation
shows variations by about a factor 3 over one hour below 3 keV and no
variability above. Their simultaneous broad band energy spectral distributions
can be successfully interpreted within the frame of a homogeneous synchrotron

source of seed photons with the different spectral states of S5 0716+714 being
reproduced by changing the injected power. The resulting parameters are fully
consistent with the two sources being intermediate objects within the

present view of how accretion occurs comes directly from the comparison of
theory with observations of these sources. Since theory differs little for
other objects such as active galaxies, increasing efforts have recently gone
into searching for correspondences in observed behaviour. This chapter aims at
giving a concise summary of the field, with particular emphasis on new
developments since the previous edition of this book. These developments have
been significant. Much of the earlier literature implicitly assumed that
accreting binaries were fairly steady sources accreting most of the mass
entering their vicinity, often with main-sequence companions, and radiating the
resulting accretion luminosity in rough isotropy. We shall see that in reality
these assumptions fail for the majority of systems. Most are transient; mass
ejection in winds and jets is extremely common; a large (sometimes dominant)
fraction of even short-period systems have evolved companions whose structure
deviates significantly from the zero-age main sequence; and the radiation
pattern of many objects is significantly anisotropic. It is now possible to
give a complete characterization of the observed incidence of transient and
persistent sources in terms of the disc instability model and formation
constraints. X-ray populations in external galaxies, particularly the
ultraluminous sources, are revealing important new insights into accretion
processes and compact binary evolution.

temperatures of the order of 17 000 K. The weak temperature dependence of the
ratios of helium lines at 4471, 5876 and 6678 Angstroms is used to derive a
temperature of 8850 K for knot J3 and 4600 K for knot J1. Ratios of O II
recombination lines, which directly measure the temperature in the coldest

  We calculate abundances both from collisionally excited lines and from the
well-observed recombination spectra of C, N, O and Ne ions. The forbidden line
abundances agree well with previous determinations, but the recombination line
abundances are several hundred times higher. These results confirm the scenario
proposed by Harrington and Feibelman (1984) in which the knots contain a cold
core highly enriched in heavy elements. Forbidden lines are almost entirely
emitted by the hot outer part of the knot, while recombination lines are
emitted predominantly from the cold core. The C/O ratios we derive imply that
the knots are oxygen-rich, contrary to theoretical predictions for born-again

models for radiative transfer in dusty galactic environments to arrive at the
UV attenuation factors. We show that the dust in the LBGs exhibit SMC-like
characteristics rather than MW-like, and that the dust geometry in these

show that the attenuation factor exhibits a pronounced dependence on the
luminosity of the LBG, $a_{1600}\propto (L/L_\sun)^\alpha$, where
$0.5\leq\alpha\leq1.5$. The exponent $\alpha$ depends on the initial parameters
of the stellar population chosen to model the galaxies and the dust properties.
We find that the luminosity weighted average attenuation factor is likely to be
in the range from $5.7-18.5$, which is consistent with the upper limits to the

current UV/optical surveys do detect the bulk of the star formation during the

to dominate for jets (and possibly hot spots) undergoing bulk relativistic

radiation from the AGN should be observable from radio lobes, especially if

Both the ^{12}CO/^{13}CO J=2-1 and 3-2 integrated intensity ratios are
remarkably high in the overlap region. This is the first published case in
which such high $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO J=2-1 and 3-2 ratios are found outside a

of magnitude lower than the conventional value for molecular clouds in the

radiative efficiency, possibly caused by a large velocity dispersion within the
individual molecular clouds. A comparison of the CO J=3-2 emission with the

over ~300 km/s in a single night. The most plausible interpretation of these
components is that they are formed by irradiation of the companion star and the
velocities indicate its orbital motion. We also detect motion of the wings of
the HeII 4686A line and changes in its morphology. No previously proposed
period is consistent with periodic behavior of all of these measures. However,
consistent and sensible solutions are obtained for periods around 1.7 days. For
the best period, 1.7557 days, we estimate a mass function of 5.8 +/- 0.5 Msun.
Even allowing for aliases, the 95% confidence lower-limit on the mass function
is 2.0 Msun. GX339-4 can therefore be added to the list of dynamical black hole
candidates. This is supported by the small motion in the wings of the HeII
line; if the compact object velocity is not larger than the observed motion
then the mass ratio is q < 0.08, similar to other systems harboring black
holes. Finally, we note that the sharp components are not always present, but
do seem to occur within a repeating phase range. This appears to migrate
between our epochs of observation, and may indicate shielding of the companion
star by a variable accretion geometry such as a warp.

sharp notches with opening angles of 0 degrees (a crack), 70.53 degrees, 90

by etching into microelectromechanical structures and tend to be the initiation
sites for failure by fracture of these structures. Analogous to the stress
intensity factor of traditional linear elastic fracture mechanics which
characterizes the stress state in the limiting case of a crack, there exists a
similar parameter K for the case of the notch. In the case of silicon, a
brittle material, this characterization appears to be particularly valid. We
use three interatomic potentials: a modified Stillinger-Weber potential, the
Environment-Dependent Interatomic Potential (EDIP), and the modified embedded
atom method (MEAM). Of these, MEAM gives critical K-values closest to
experiment. In particular the EDIP potential leads to unphysical ductile
failure in most geometries. Because the units of K depend on the notch angle,
the shape of the K versus angle plot depends on the units used. In particular
when an atomic length unit is used the plot is almost flat, showing--in
principle from macroscopic observations alone--the association of an atomic
length scale to the fracture process.

voids by mutations is often regarded as destabilizing. In this study we show
that packing density for single domain proteins decreases with chain length. We
find that the radius of gyration provides poor description of protein packing
but the alpha contact number we introduce here characterize proteins well. We
further demonstrate that protein-like scaling relationship between packing
density and chain length is observed in off-lattice self-avoiding walks. A key
problem in studying compact chain polymer is the attrition problem: It is
difficult to generate independent samples of compact long self-avoiding walks.
We develop an algorithm based on the framework of sequential Monte Carlo and
succeed in generating populations of compact long chain off-lattice polymers up
to length $N=2,000$. Results based on analysis of these chain polymers suggest
that maintaining high packing density is only characteristic of short chain
proteins. We found that the scaling behavior of packing density with chain
length of proteins is a generic feature of random polymers satisfying loose
constraint in compactness. We conclude that proteins are not optimized by
evolution to eliminate packing voids.

  depends on the adsorption with the substrate",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  Recent experiments have demonstrated that the glass transition temperature of
thin polymer films can be shifted as compared to the same polymer in the bulk,
the amplitude and the sign of this effect depending on the interaction between
the polymer and the substrate. A model has been proposed recently for
explaining these effects in two limiting cases: suspended films and strongly
adsorbed films. We extend here this model for describing the cross-over between
these two situations. We show here how, by adjusting the strength of the
adsorption, one can control the glass transition temperature of thin polymer
films. In particular, we show that the shift of glass transition temperature,
refered to that of a suspended film, varies like $\epsilon^{1/\gamma_2}$ where
$\epsilon$ is the adsorption energy per monomer and $\gamma_2$ is the critical
exponent for the mass of aggregates in the 2D percolation problem. We show also
that the interaction leads to an increase of $T_g$ for $\epsilon$ as small as a
few $0.01 T$ where $T$ is the thermal energy, and that this increase saturates
at the value corresponding to strongly interacting films for adsorption
energies of order $0.5 T$.

LiTaO$_{3}$ using ultrafast optical pulses. These polaritons are coupled modes
consisting of mostly far-infrared radiation and a small phonon component, which
are excited through nonlinear optical processes involving the Raman and the
second-order susceptibilities (difference frequency generation). We probe their
associated hybrid vibrational-electric field, in the THz range, by
electro-optic sampling methods. The measured field patterns agree very well
with calculations for the field due to a distribution of dipoles that follows
the shape and moves with the group velocity of the optical pulses. For a
tightly focused pulse, the pattern is identical to that of classical Cherenkov
radiation by a moving dipole. Results for other shapes and, in particular, for
the planar and transient-grating geometries, are accounted for by a convolution
of the Cherenkov field due to a point dipole with the function describing the
slowly-varying intensity of the pulse. Hence, polariton fields resulting from
pulses of arbitrary shape can be described quantitatively in terms of
expressions for the Cherenkov radiation emitted by an extended source. Using
the Cherenkov approach, we recover the phase-matching conditions that lead to
the selection of specific polariton wavevectors in the planar and transient
grating geometry as well as the Cherenkov angle itself. The formalism can be
easily extended to media exhibiting dispersion in the THz range. Calculations
and experimental data for point-like and planar sources reveal significant
differences between the so-called superluminal and subluminal cases where the
group velocity of the optical pulses is, respectively, above and below the
highest phase velocity in the infrared.

accomplished by lowering the Nyquist sampling rate of the signal in the trigger

been previously assumed. This greatly improves the convergence of the
perturbation series, and yields a result with mild factorization-scale

integrated over the momenta of the final-state particles, is very sensitive to
the factorization and renormalization scales. For scales of order m_h/4 the gg
-> b\bar{b}h cross section is comparable to that of b\bar{b} -> h, in contrast
to the order-of-magnitude discrepancy between these two calculations for the
scale m_h. The result we obtain improves the prospects for Higgs-boson
discovery at hadron colliders for large values of tan(\beta).

opens up the way to formulate the non-perturbative contribution to the

convoluted with the Sudakov-resummed perturbative result. We implement this

Dressed Gluon Exponentiation. The Sudakov exponent is calculated in a process
independent way from a generalized splitting function which describes the

due to OPE singularities near the boundary interaction, the computation of
boundary correlators is a challenging problem which we address but do not fully
solve. Analytic continuation from the known correlators of spatial boundary
Liouville to TBL encounters an infinite accumulation of poles and zeros. A
particular contour prescription is proposed which cancels the poles against the
zeros in the boundary correlator $d(\o) $ of two operators of weight $\o^2$ and
yields a finite result. A general relation is proposed between two-point CFT
correlators and stringy Bogolubov coefficients, according to which the
magnitude of $d(\o)$ determines the rate of open string pair creation during
tachyon condensation. The rate so obtained agrees at large $\o$ with a
minisuperspace analysis of previous work. It is suggested that the mathematical
ambiguity arising in the prescription for analytic continuation of the

Killing vector of Minkowski space-time). In this paper, closed n-2 forms in the
full interacting theory are constructed in terms of a one parameter family of

These forms thus allow one to apply Stokes theorem without bulk contributions

asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-times is derived.

in energy consistent with the cyclicity of the RG. We conjecture that this

of the massive charged dS C-metric. These diagrams allow us to clearly identify

Minkowski spacetime and we represent the motion of the dS C-metric origin in
the dS 4-hyperboloid as well as the localization of the strut. Third, we
comment on the physical properties of the strut that connects the two black

resistor-inductor-varactor diode (RLD) nonlinear resonant circuit. We find that
resonators driven at frequencies much higher than the diode reverse recovery
rate do not show period doubling, and that models of chaos based on the
nonlinear capacitance of the varactor diode display a reverse-recovery-like
effect, and this effect strongly resembles reverse recovery of real diodes. We
find for the first time that in addition to the known dependence of the reverse
recovery time on past current maxima, there are also important nonlinear
dependencies on pulse frequency, duty-cycle, and DC voltage bias. Similar
nonlinearities are present in the nonlinear capacitance models of these diodes.
We conclude that a history-dependent and nonlinear reverse recovery time is an
essential ingredient for chaotic behavior of this circuit, and demonstrate for
the first time that all major competing models have this effect, either
explicitly or implicitly. Besides unifying the two major models of RLD chaos,
our work reveals that the nonlinearities of the reverse recovery time must be
included for a complete understanding of period doubling and chaos in this
circuit.

inspired by Lattice QCD calculations and reproduces the average energy values
of the SU(6) multiplets. The splittings are obtained with a SU(6)-breaking
interaction, which can include also an isospin dependent term. The model has
been used for predictions concerning the electromagnetic transition form
factors giving a good description of the medium $Q^2$-behaviour. In particular
the calculated helicity amplitude $A_{{1/2}}$ for the $S_{11}(1535)$ resonance
agrees very well with the recent CLAS data. Furthermore, we have shown for the
first time that the decreasing of the ratio of the elastic form factors of the
proton is due to relativistic effects. Finally, the elastic nucleon form
factors have been calculated using a relativistic version of the hCQM and a
relativistic quark current.

the momentum and density dependent isovector nuclear spin-orbit strength
$V_{ls}(p,k_f)$. This quantity is derived from the spin-dependent part of the

\times\vec p)[U_{ls}(p,k_f)- V_{ls}(p,k_f)\tau_3 \delta] $ of a nucleon
scattering off weakly inhomogeneous isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. We find
that iterated $1\pi$-exchange generates at saturation density, $k_{f0}=272.7
$MeV, an isovector nuclear spin-orbit strength at $p=0$ of $V_{ls}(0,k_{f0})
\simeq 50$ MeVfm$^2$. This value is about 1.4 times the analogous isoscalar
nuclear spin-orbit strength $U_{ls}(0,k_{f0})\simeq 35$ MeVfm$^2$ generated by
the same two-pion exchange diagrams. We also calculate several relativistic
1/M-corrections to the isoscalar nuclear spin-orbit strength. In particular, we
evaluate the contributions from irreducible two-pion exchange to
$U_{ls}(p,k_f)$. The effects of the three-body diagrams constructed from the
Weinberg-Tomozawa $\pi\pi NN$-contact vertex on the isoscalar nuclear
spin-orbit strength are computed. We find that such relativistic
1/M-corrections are less than 20% of the isoscalar nuclear spin-orbit strength
generated by iterated one-pion-exchange, in accordance with the expectation
from chiral power counting.

forbidden region and also in the allowed region. At relatively high energy the
physical branch describes tunneling via creation of a classical state, close to
the top of the barrier. The method is checked against exact solutions of the

between many different areas: quantum computation, adiabatic evolution,
analysis of spectral gaps and groundstates of Hamiltonians, rapidly mixing
Markov chains, the complexity class statistical zero knowledge, quantum random
walks, and more.
  We first show that many natural candidates for quantum algorithms can be cast
as a state generation problem. We define a paradigm for state generation,
called 'adiabatic state generation' and develop tools for adiabatic state
generation which include methods for implementing very general Hamiltonians and
ways to guarantee non negligible spectral gaps. We use our tools to prove that
adiabatic state generation is equivalent to state generation in the standard
quantum computing model, and finally we show how to apply our techniques to
generate interesting superpositions related to Markov chains.

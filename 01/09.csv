search for a population of intergalactic globular clusters (GCs) belonging to
Abell 1185, a richness I cluster at cz = 9800 km/s. The field is noteworthy in
that it contains no bright galaxies and yet is centered on the peak of the
cluster's X-ray surface brightess distribution. We detect a total of 99 point
sources in this field to a limiting magnitude I_F814W ~ 26. An identical
analysis of the Hubble Deep Field North, which serves as our control field,
reveals a total of 12 objects in the same magnitude range. We discuss possible
explanations for this discrepancy, and conclude that the point source excess is
likely due to the presence of GCs within A1185. The number and spatial
distribution of these GCs are consistent with their being intergalactic in
nature, although we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the GCs may be
associated with neighboring bright galaxies. Deeper imaging with the Advanced
Camera for Surveys may resolve this ambiguity.

  Our analysis shows that forthcoming ground and balloon measures will allow a

significantly improve the constraints already provided by the FIRAS data on the
possible energy exchanges in the primeval plasma. The same holds even improving
the sensitivity up to ~10 times.
  Thus, we have studied the impact of very high quality data, such those in
principle achievable with a space experiment like DIMES planned to measure the
CMB absolute temperature at 0.5 - 15 cm with a sensitivity of ~0.1 mK, close to
that of FIRAS. Such high quality data would improve by a factor ~50 the FIRAS
results on the fractional energy exchanges associated to dissipation processes
possibly occurred in a wide range of cosmic epochs, at intermediate and high
redshifts (y_h > 1). The energy dissipation epoch could be also significantly
constrained, while the limits on the energy possibly dissipated at late epochs
can be improved by a factor ~2. In addition, such measures can provide an
independent and very accurate cross-check of FIRAS calibration. Finally, a
DIMES-like experiment will be able to provide indicative independent estimates

combined to trace the median SED of galaxies in various classes of

average bluer stellar continua and higher far-IR luminosities per unit galaxy

stellar spectra but 10-100 times lower IR luminosities. The temperature of the
cold dust component increases with the far-IR luminosity, from giant spirals to

increase of the amount of data leads to the idea that the determination of

is a large consensus around the so-called concordance model. Indeed this model
does fit an impressive set of independent data: CMB $C_l$ curve, most current
matter density estimations, Hubble constant estimation from HST, apparent
acceleration of the Universe, good matching of the power spectrum of matter
fluctuations. However, the necessary introduction of a non zero cosmological
constant is an extraordinary new mystery for physics, or more exactly the come
back of one of the ghost of modern physics since its introduction by Einstein.
Here, I would like to emphasize that some results are established beyond
reasonable doubt, like the (nearly) flatness of the universe and the existence
of a dark non-baryonic component of the Universe. But also that the evidence
for a cosmological constant may not be as strong as needed to be considered as
established beyond doubt. In this respect, I will argue that an Einstein-De
Sitter universe might still be a viable option. Three global tests: 1) the
evolution of the abundance of clusters with redshift 2) the baryon fraction
measured in local clusters 3) apparent evolution of the baryon fraction with
redshift might be consistent with a high matter density for the Universe in the
range $0.6-1.$. I therefore conclude that the dominance of vacuum to the
various density contributions to the Universe is presently an interesting and
fascinating possibility, but it is still premature to consider it as an
established scientific fact (abridged).

GRB host galaxies, most of them lying at 0.5<z<1.5, exhibit very blue colours,
comparable to those of the faint blue star-forming sources at high redshift.
They are sub-luminous in the K-band, suggesting a low stellar mass content. We
do not find any GRB hosts harbouring R- and K-band properties similar to those
characterizing the luminous infrared/submillimeter sources and the extremely
red starbursts. Should GRBs be regarded as an unbiased probe of star-forming
activity, this lack of luminous and/or reddened objects among the GRB host
sample might reveal that the detection of GRB optical afterglows is likely
biased toward unobscured galaxies. It would moreover support the idea that a
large fraction of the optically-dark GRBs occur within dust-enshrouded regions
of star formation. On the other hand, our result might also simply reflect
intrinsic properties of GRB host galaxies experiencing a first episode of very
massive star formation and characterized by a rather weak underlying stellar
population. Finally, we compute the absolute B magnitudes for the whole sample
of GRB host galaxies with known redshifts and detected at optical wavelengths.
We find that the latter appear statistically even less luminous than the
sub-luminous blue sources which mostly contributed to the B-band light emitted
at high redshift. This indicates that the formation of GRBs could be favoured
in particular systems with very low luminosities and, therefore, low
metallicities. (Abridged)

chemically peculiar magnetic stars, the Li I 6708 A spectral line presents very
anomalous behaviour: in some stars it is a strong feature, in others, with
similar atmospheric parameters, it is invisible. Interesting results were
obtained for the roAp star HD 3980 which presents variations of the profile and
position of the Li I line with the rotation period. These new observational

around a nonrotating black hole is explored by applying asymptotic analysis in
the region just outside the event horizon. We assume that the viscous transport
is described by the standard Shakura-Sunyaev prescription throughout the disk,
including the inner region close to the horizon. One of our goals is to explore
the self-consistency of this assumption by analyzing the causality of the
viscous transport near the black hole. The effects of general relativity are
incorporated in an approximate manner by utilizing a pseudo-Newtonian
gravitational potential. Analysis of the conservation equations yields unique
asymptotic forms for the behaviors of the radial inflow velocity, the density,
the sound speed, and the angular velocity. The specific behaviors are
determined by three quantities; namely, the accreted specific energy, the
accreted specific angular momentum, and the accreted specific entropy. The
additional requirement of passage through a sonic point further constrains the
problem, leaving only two free parameters. Our detailed results confirm that
the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity yields a well-behaved flow structure in the inner
region that satisfies the causality constraint. We also show that the velocity
distribution predicted by our pseudo-Newtonian model agrees with general
relativity in the vicinity of the horizon. The asymptotic expressions we derive
provide convenient boundary conditions for the development of global models via
numerical integration of the conservation equations.

behaviour. In crystals, elasticity is associated with phonons, quantized
sound-wave excitations. Phonon-like excitations exist also in glasses at very
high frequencies (THz), and they remarkably persist into the supercooled
liquid. A universal feature of these amorphous systems is the Boson peak: the
vibrational density of states $g(\omega)$ has an excess over the Debye (squared
frequency) law, seen as a peak in $g(\omega)/\omega^2$. We claim that this peak
is the signature of a phase transition in the space of the stationary points of
the energy, from a minima-dominated phase (with phonons) at low energy to a
saddle-point dominated phase (without phonons). Here, by studying the spectra
of inherent structures (local minima of the potential energy), we show that
this is the case in a realistic glass model: the Boson peak moves to lower
frequencies on approaching the phonon-saddle transition and its height diverges
at the critical point. The numerical results agree with Euclidean Random Matrix
Theory predictions on the existence of a sharp phase transition between an
amorphous elastic phase and a phonon-free one.

we obtain the corresponding phase boundary up to 1.2GPa, and argue that it must
drop to T=0 before p reaches 1.8GPa. There is a wide temperature range where
the electrical properties are fairly sensitive to pressure, indicating the

a system of extended bodies in a scalar alternative theory of gravitation: the
size of one of the bodies being a small parameter xi, we calculate the limit,
as xi tends towards 0, of the post-Newtonian (PN) acceleration of this small
body. We use the asymptotic scheme of PN approximation, that expands all
fields. We find that the PN acceleration A of the small body keeps a
structure-dependent part at this limit. In particular, if the only massive body
is static and spherical, then A differs from the PN acceleration of a test
particle in a Schwarzschild field only by this structure-dependent part. The
presence of the latter is due to the fact that the PN metric depends on the
first spatial derivatives of the Newtonian potential. Since just the same form
of PN metric is valid for the standard form of Schwarzschild's solution, the
acceleration of a small body might keep a structure-dependent part at the point
limit in general relativity also, depending on the gauge. The magnitude of the
structure-dependent acceleration is already challenging on Earth. For the
Pioneer spacecrafts, it is likely to discard the current version of the scalar

  bundles","AMS-LaTeX2e, 35 pages, 2 figures. References and new results on
  time-dependent flows added",,,,"math.DG math.DS math.SG",,"  The main theme of this paper is a relative version of the almost existence
theorem for periodic orbits of autonomous Hamiltonian systems.
  We show that almost all low levels of a function on a geometrically bounded
symplectically aspherical manifold carry contractible periodic orbits of the
Hamiltonian flow, provided that the function attains its minimum along a closed
symplectic submanifold. As an immediate consequence, we obtain the existence of
contractible periodic orbits on almost all low energy levels for twisted
geodesic flows with symplectic magnetic field. We give examples of functions
with a sequence of regular levels without periodic orbits, converging to an
isolated, but very degenerate, minimum.
  The proof of the relative almost existence theorem hinges on the notion of
the relative Hofer-Zehnder capacity and on showing that this capacity of a
small neighborhood of a symplectic submanifold is finite. The latter is carried
out by proving that the flow of a Hamiltonian with sufficiently large variation
has a non-trivial contractible one-periodic orbit, when the Hamiltonian is
constant and equal to its maximum near a symplectic submanifold and supported
in a neighborhood of the submanifold.

adequate description of the superfluid states of neutron matter at densities
some 2-3 times that of saturated symmetrical nuclear matter. The problem of
solving the system of BCS gap equations expressing the $^3P_2$-$^3F_2$ model is
attacked with the aid of the separation approach. This method, developed
originally for quantitative study of S-wave pairing in the presence of strong
short-range repulsions, serves effectively to reduce the coupled, singular,
nonlinear BCS integral equations to a set of coupled algebraic equations. For
the first time, sufficient precision becomes accessible to resolve small energy
splittings between the different pairing states. Adopting a perturbative
strategy, we are able to identify and characterize the full repertoire of real
solutions of the $^3P_2$-$^3F_2$ pairing model, in the limiting regime of small
tensor-coupling strength. The P-F channel coupling is seen to lift the striking
parametric degeneracies revealed by a earlier separation treatment of the pure,
uncoupled $^3P_2$ pairing problem. Remarkably, incisive and robust results are
obtained solely on the basis of analytic arguments. Unlike the traditional
Ginzburg-Landau approach, the analysis is not restricted to the immediate
vicinity of the critical temperature, but is equally reliable at zero
temperature. Interesting connections and contrasts are drawn between triplet
pairing in dense neutron matter and triplet pairing in liquid $^3$He.

strings, phenotypes and ages. We discuss the influence of probabilities of
survival of the individuals on the dynamics and phenotypic variability of the
population.
  We show that constant survival probabilities of individuals are propitious
for preserving phenotypic variability of the population. For constant survival
probabilities oscillations of 'the average fitness' of the population and
normal distributions of the phenotypes are observed. When the probabilities of
survival are directly proportinal to the individuals' adaptations the
population can reach the maximum possible average adaptation, but the
phenotypic variability of the population is completely lost and oscillations of
'the average fitness' of the population do not occur.
  We also investigate the behaviour of the population caused by the
probabilities of survival that partly depend on the individuals' adaptations.
The role of the length of the individuals' genetic strings is considered here.

view that de Broglie waves have a gravitational origin. In view of the extreme
weakness of the gravitational field, however, this seems to be an unlikely
proposition. We consider the problem of the atom in the light of a proposed
electron theory [physics/0212013] and show that in this theory an insignificant
perturbation in the gravitational field might in effect be amplified by
astonishingly large orders of magnitudes. On this basis we then propose a
realistic model of an atom where the electron continually tunnels through the
electrostatic field of the proton and the de Broglie waves take on the role of
the missing electrostatic interactions. Although the discussion is a
qualitative one, and as such may not be considered as being conclusive, never
the less, we believe that on the evidence presented here the possibility of a
gravitational origin for the de Broglie waves must be seriously considered.

dimensional reduction in stimulus space and the nonlinearity inherent in a
spiking output. White noise stimulus and reverse correlation (the
spike-triggered average and spike-triggered covariance) are often used in
experimental neuroscience to `ask' neurons which dimensions in stimulus space
they are sensitive to, and to characterize the nonlinearity of the response. In
this paper, we apply reverse correlation to the simplest model neuron with
temporal dynamics--the leaky integrate-and-fire model--and find that even for
this simple case standard techniques do not recover the known neural
computation. To overcome this, we develop novel reverse correlation techniques
by selectively analyzing only `isolated' spikes, and taking explicit account of
the extended silences that precede these isolated spikes. We discuss the
implications of our methods to the characterization of neural adaptation.
Although these methods are developed in the context of the leaky
integrate-and-fire model, our findings are relevant for the analysis of spike
trains from real neurons.

We derive the exact action for a damped mechanical system in the frame of the
path integral formulation of the quantum Brownian motion problem developed by
Schwinger and by Feynman and Vernon. The doubling of the phase-space degrees of
freedom for dissipative systems and thermal field theories is discussed and the
doubled variables are related to quantum noise effects. The 't Hooft proposal,
according to which the loss of information due to dissipation in a classical
deterministic system manifests itself in the quantum features of the system, is
analyzed and the quantum spectrum of the harmonic oscillator is shown to be
originated from the dissipative character of the original classical
deterministic system.

low temperatures. With the temperature decrease the mean free path for
electrons becomes larger than the field penetration depth. In this condition
description of metals with the impedance of anomalous skin effect is shown to
be more appropriate than with the permittivity. The effect is crucial for the
temperature correction. It is demonstrated that in the zero frequency limit the
reflection coefficients should coincide with those of ideal metal if we demand
the entropy to be zero at T=0. All the other prescriptions discussed in the
literature for the $n=0$ term in the Lifshitz formula give negative entropy. It
is shown that the temperature correction in the region of anomalous skin effect
is not suppressed as it happens in the plasma model. This correction will be
important in the future cryogenic measurements of the Casimir force.

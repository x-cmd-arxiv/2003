of the planet. The planet is assumed to be in a fixed circular orbit about the
central star. It is also assumed to be able to accrete gas without expansion on
the scale of its Roche radius. Only planets with masses $M \gsim 0.1$ M$_J$
produce significant perturbations in the disc's surface density. The flow
within the Roche lobe of the planet is fully three-dimensional. Gas streams
generally enter the Roche lobe close to the disc midplane, but produce much
weaker shocks than the streams in two-dimensional models. The streams supply
material to a circumplanetary disc that rotates in the same sense as the
planet's orbit. Much of the mass supply to the circumplanetary disc comes from
non-coplanar flow. The accretion rate peaks with a planet mass of approximately
0.1 M$_J$ and is highly efficient, occurring at the local viscous rate. The
migration timescales for planets of mass less than 0.1 M$_J$, based on torques
from disc material outside the planets' Roche lobes, are in excellent agreement
with the linear theory of Type I (non-gap) migration for three-dimensional
discs. The transition from Type I to Type II (gap) migration is smooth, with
changes in migration times of about a factor of 2. Starting with a core which
can undergo runaway growth, a planet can gain up to a few M$_J$ with little
migration. Planets with final masses of order 10 M$_J$ would undergo large
migration, which makes formation and survival difficult.

measuring planetary oblateness from transit photometry and inferring planetary
rotational periods. The rotation rates of planets in the solar system vary
widely, reflecting the planets' diverse formational and evolutionary histories.
A measured oblateness, assumed composition, and equation of state yields a
rotation rate from the Darwin-Radau relation. The lightcurve of a transiting
oblate planet should differ significantly from that of a spherical one with the
same cross-sectional area under identical stellar and orbital conditions.
However, if the stellar and orbital parameters are not known a priori, fitting
for them allows changes in the stellar radius, planetary radius, impact
parameter, and stellar limb darkening parameters to mimic the transit signature
of an oblate planet, diminishing the oblateness signature. Thus even if
HD209458b had an oblateness of 0.1 instead of our predicted 0.003, it would
introduce a detectable departure from a model spherical lightcurve at the level
of only one part in 10^5. Planets with nonzero obliquity break this degeneracy
because their ingress lightcurve is asymmetric relative to that from egress,
and their best-case detectability is of order 10^{-4}. However, the measured
rotation rate for these objects is non-unique due to degeneracy between
obliquity and oblateness and the unknown component of obliquity along the line
of sight. Detectability of oblateness is maximized for planets transiting near
an impact parameter of 0.7 regardless of obliquity. Future measurements of
oblateness will be challenging because the signal is near the photometric
limits of current hardware and inherent stellar noise levels.

on our earlier work (Hailey & Mori 2002) we have examined all previously
proposed atmospheric models for 1E1207.4-5209. Using our atomic code, which
rapidly solves Schrodinger's equation for arbitrary ion in strong magnetic
field (Mori & Hailey 2002), we have systematically constructed atmospheric
models by calculating polarization-dependent LTE opacities and addressed all
the physics relevant to strongly-magnetized plasmas. We have been able to rule
out virtually all atmospheric models because they either do not sustain an
ionization balance consistent with the claimed atmosphere composition or
because they predict line strengths and line widths which are inconsistent with
the data. Only Oxygen or Neon atmospheres at B~10^{12} G provide
self-consistent atmospheric solutions of appropriate ionization balance and
with line widths, strengths and energies consistent with the observations. The
observed features are likely composed of several bound-bound transition lines
from highly-ionized oxygen/neon and they are broadened primarily by motional
Stark effects and magnetic field variation over the line-emitting region.
Further considerations of plausible mechanisms for the formation of a mid-Z
atmosphere likely rule out Neon atmospheres, and have important implications
for the fallback mechanism in supernova ejecta. Future high resolution
spectroscopy missions such as Constellation-X will be able to resolve predicted
substructure in the absorption features and will measure magnetic field
strength and gravitational redshift independently to better than 10% accuracy.

conducted from immediately after the optical maximum to the final fading toward
the quiescence. In the first-ever complete light-curve, a few primary and
secondary eclipses of the binary system were detected, and the timings of the
minima were determined. We found that the eclipses showed no totality during
the outburst. The depth of the primary eclipses was 0.4-0.8 mag, much shallower
than that in quiescence. In the plateau phase, very little irradiation (< 0.1
mag) was observed in the orbital light curve, which implies the existence and a
large flaring rim of the accretion disk during the outburst. The minima of the
eclipses were detected at earlier orbital phases for the predicted ephemerides.
Thus, we obtained an orbital period change of the binary system as \dot{P}/P =
-1.7 (+/- 0.7) x 10^{-6} yr^{-1} from the O-C. Assuming that this period change
is a result of the conservative mass transfer between the component stars, its
mass-transfer rate reaches \dot{M} = 2.4 (+/- 1.0) x 10^{-6} M_solar yr^{-1}
for a 1.37 M_solar white dwarf and a 2.0 M_solar mass-donor companion, which is

decide whether a given parametric model describes the observational data
sufficiently well or whether a non-parametric modelling becomes necessary.
However, in contrast to common practice this cannot be decided by solely
comparing the quality of fit due to possible over-fitting by the non-parametric
method. Therefore, in this paper we present a resampling algorithm which allows
to decide whether deviations between a parametric and a non-parametric model
are systematic or due to noise. The algorithm is based on a statistical
comparison of the corresponding residuals, under the assumption of the
parametric model as well as under violation of this assumption. This yields a
graphical tool for a robust decision making of parametric versus non-parametric
modelling.
  Moreover, our approach can be used for the selection of the most proper model
among several competitors (model selection). The methods are illustrated by the
problem of recovering the luminosity density in the Milky Way [MW] from
near-infrared [NIR] surface brightness data of the DIRBE experiment on board of
the COBE satellite. Among the parametric models investigated one with 4-armed
spiral structure performs best. In this model the Sagittarius-Carina arm and
its counter-arm are significantly weaker than the other pair of arms.
Furthermore, we find statistical evidence for an improvement over a range of
parametric models with different spiral structure morphologies by a
non-parametric model of Bissantz & Gerhard (2002).

protoplanet. The coorbital torque is assumed to come from orbit crossing fluid
elements which exchange angular momentum with the planet when they execute a
U-turn at the end of horseshoe streamlines. When the planet migrates inward,
the fluid elements of the inner disk undergo one such exchange as they pass to
the outer disk. The angular momentum they gain is removed from the planet, and
this corresponds to a negative contribution to the corotation torque, which
scales with the drift rate. In addition, the material trapped in the coorbital
region drifts radially with the planet giving a positive contribution to the
corotation torque, which also scales with the drift rate. These two
contributions do not cancel out if the coorbital region is depleted, in which
case there is a net corotation torque which scales with the drift rate and the
mass deficit in the coorbital region, and which has same sign as the drift
rate. This leads to a positive feedback on the migrating planet. In particular,
if the coorbital mass deficit is larger than the planet mass, the migration
rate undergoes a runaway which can vary the protoplanet semi-major axis by 50%
over a few tens of orbits. This can happen only if the planet mass is
sufficient to create a dip or gap in its surrounding region, and if the
surrounding disk mass is larger than the planet mass. This typically
corresponds to planet masses in the sub-Saturnian to Jovian mass range embedded
in massive protoplanetary disks. Runaway migration is a good candidate to
account for the orbital characteristics of close orbiting giant planets, most
of which have sub-Jovian masses. Further, we show that in the runaway regime,
migration can be directed outwards.

widely believed that these materials are quite different below $T_{c}$ with the
unit cell of PMN remaining cubic while in PZN the low temperature unit cell is
rhombohedral in shape. However, this has been clarified by recent high-energy
x-ray studies which have shown that PZN is rhombohedral only in the skin while
the shape of the unit cell in the bulk is nearly cubic. In this study we have
performed both neutron elastic and inelastic scattering to show that the
temperature dependence of both the diffuse and phonon scattering in PZN and PMN
is very similar. Both compounds show a nearly identical recovery of the soft
optic mode and a broadening of the acoustic mode below $T_{c}$. The diffuse
scattering in PZN is suggestive of an onset at the high temperature Burns
temperature similar to that in PMN. In contrast to PMN, we observe a broadening
of the Bragg peaks in both the longitudinal and transverse directions below
$T_{c}$. We reconcile this additional broadening, not observed in PMN, in terms
of structural inhomogeneity in PZN. Based on the strong similarities between
PMN and PZN, we suggest that both materials belong to the same universality
class and discuss the relaxor transition in terms of the three-dimensional
Heisenberg model with cubic anisotropy in a random field.

extensively using ab initio methods, yet remarkably there is still no consensus

differences between previous calculations can be attributed to supercell
convergence errors, and we demonstrate how to systematically reduce each such
source of error. The various sources of scatter in previous theoretical studies
are discussed and a new effect, that of supercell symmetry, is identified. It
is shown that a consistent treatment of this effect is crucial to understanding
the systematic effects of increasing the supercell size. This work therefore

an exponent $\sigma$, the value of which depends on the probability $p$. The
exponent $\sigma$ decreases continuously as $p$ increases. For $p=0$, the total

\simeq 3 \times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ and $\sin^2{2\theta_{atm}} \simeq 1$, and that
conversion into $\nu_e$ is strongly disfavored. The Super-Kamiokande (SK)
collaboration, using a combination of three techniques, reports that their data
favor $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$ over $\nu_\mu \to \nu_{sterile}$. This distinction
is extremely important for both four-neutrino models and cosmology. We propose
that neutrino-proton elastic scattering ($\nu + p \to \nu + p$) in water
\v{C}erenkov detectors can also distinguish between active and sterile
oscillations. This was not previously recognized as a useful channel since only
about 2% of struck protons are above the \v{C}erenkov threshold. Nevertheless,
in the present SK data there should be about 40 identifiable events. We show
that these events have unique particle identification characteristics, point in
the direction of the incoming neutrinos, and correspond to a narrow range of
neutrino energies (1-3 GeV, oscillating near the horizon). This channel will be
particularly important in Hyper-Kamiokande, with $\sim 40$ times higher rate.
Our results have other important applications. First, for a similarly small
fraction of atmospheric neutrino quasielastic events, the proton is

splittings and mixings from current solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator
neutrino data. A brief discussion is given of cosmological and astrophysical
implications. Non-oscillation phenomena such as neutrinoless double beta decay
would, if discovered, probe the absolute scale of neutrino mass and also reveal
their Majorana nature. Non-oscillation descriptions in terms of spin-flavor
precession (SFP) and non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) currently provide
an excellent fit of the solar data. However they are at odds with the first
results from the KamLAND experiment which imply that, despite their theoretical
interest, non-standard mechanisms can only play a sub-leading role in the solar
neutrino anomaly. Accepting the LMA-MSW solution, one can use the current solar
neutrino data to place important restrictions on non-standard neutrino
properties, such as neutrino magnetic moments. Both solar and atmospheric
neutrino data can also be used to place constraints on neutrino instability as
well as the more exotic possibility of $CPT$ and Lorentz Violation.
Weillustrate the potential of future data from experiments such as KamLAND,
Borexino and the upcoming neutrino factories in constraining non-standard
neutrino properties.

unity order. The full analytical solution is then found by the perturbation
technique. The important feature of the presented method is that it deals with

give additional conditions on which $\Lie_X$ is even a quasi-inner derivation.

the physics of the photon-baryon fluid at recombination. From this, MAP
measurements will constrain models of structure formation, the geometry of the

is generally excellent to the -60 dB level (80 degrees from the beam peak).
This agreement verifies the beam-predicting software and the manufacturing

investigate the time-dependent response of the nebular ionization and

study how the asymptotic mean value, <t^2>, behaves as a function of the period

fluctuations occur only in the outer section of the nebula, close to the
ionization front, within a zone corresponding to 8-20% of the ionized layer's

required to achieve a <t^2> = 0.025 (as in the Orion nebula) is unacceptably
large. Source variability is therefore not a viable mechanism to explain the

usual meaning on scales of <= t_P = sqrt(hbar G/c^5) ~ 5.4E-44 s, the Planck
time. According to quantum gravity, the time t of an event cannot be determined
more accurately than a standard deviation of the form sigma_t/t = a_o
(t_P/t)^a, where a_o and a are positive constants ~1; likewise distances are
subject to an ultimate uncertainty c \sigma_t, where c is the speed of light.
As a consequence, the period and wavelength of light cannot be specified
precisely; rather, they are independently subject to the same intrinsic
limitations in our knowledge of time and space, so that even the most
monochromatic plane wave must in reality be a superposition of waves with
varying omega and {\bf k}, each having a different phase velcocity omega/k. For
the entire accessible range of the electromagnetic spectrum this effect is
extremely small, but can cumulatively lead to a complete loss of phase
information if the emitted radiation propagated a sufficiently large distance.
Since, at optical frequencies, the phase coherence of light from a distant
point source is a necessary condition for the presence of diffraction patterns
when the source is viewed through a telescope, such observations offer by far
the most sensitive and uncontroversial test. We show that the HST detection of
Airy rings from the active galaxy PKS1413+135, located at a distance of 1.2
Gpc, secures the exclusion of all first order (a=1) quantum gravity
fluctuations with an amplitude a_o > 0.003. The same result may be used to
deduce that the speed of light in vacuo is exact to a few parts in 10^32.

Simulations predict a relatively tight correlation between the local Lya

of the transmitted flux can constrain the amplitude and shape of the matter
power spectrum at high redshift, test the assumption of Gaussian initial
conditions, and probe the evolution of dark energy by measuring the Hubble
parameter H(z). Simulations predict increased Lya absorption in the vicinity of
galaxies, but observations show a Lya deficit within Delta_r ~ 0.5 Mpc/h
(comoving). We investigate idealized models of ""winds"" and find that they must
eliminate neutral hydrogen out to comoving radii ~1.5 Mpc/h to marginally
explain the data. Winds of this magnitude suppress the flux power spectrum by
\~0.1 dex but have little effect on the distribution function or threshold
crossing frequency. In light of the stringent demands on winds, we consider the
alternative possibility that extended Lya emission from target galaxies
replaces absorbed flux, but we conclude that this explanation is unlikely.

It covers 0.0370 sq. deg. and consists of 31 shallow (4-6 orbit), randomly
selected high latitude HST WFPC2 parallel fields with images taken in both the
B (F450W) and I (F814W) filters. The goal is to morphologically classify the
galaxies in a homogeneous manner and study galaxy properties as a function of
type and B-band magnitude for 18<b_J<23.5 mag. The B-band selected galaxies are
classified using an artificial neural network (ANN) galaxy classifier on the
higher S/N I-band images. These provide reliable types for I<24 mag (or b_J<26
mag), since these I-band classifications are less subject to the uncertain
redshifted rest-frame UV morphology. The ANN classification depends on the
shape of the surface brightness profile, but not on color. These results are
combined with deeper studies in the HDF-N and the deep WFPC2 field surrounding
the radio galaxy 53W002, for which galaxies have been classified to b_J<27 mag.
The galaxy counts for the combined B-band selected samples show adequate
statistics for a range 19<b_J<27 mag, and are in good agreement with other
studies in the flux range where they overlap, while showing improved statistics
at the bright end. The galaxies are divided into 3 morphological classes: E/S0,
Sabc and Sd/Irr, and the B-band counts are presented for each class, as well as
the total counts. The faint end of the counts is dominated by the Sd/Irr
galaxies. These type dependent counts are compared to models based on local
luminosity functions which include the effects of the Cosmological Constant.
The BBPS sample, along with the two deeper fields, is used to delineate the
general trends of effective radius and (B-I) color as a function of both
morphological type and apparent magnitude 18<b_J<27 mag.

hole accretion discs. We provide a {\it generalized two parameter solution
scheme} for multi-transonic, accretion and wind around Schwarzschild black
holes, by mainly concentrating on accretion solutions which may contain steady,
standing isothermal shocks. Such shocks conserve flow temperature by the
dissipation of energy at the shock location.Unlike previous works in this
field, our calculation is {\it not} restricted to any particular kind of
post-Newtonian gravitational potentials, rather we use {\it all} available
pseudo-Schwarzschild potentials to formulate and solve the equations governing
the accretion and wind only in terms of flow temperature $T$ and specific
angular momentum $\lambda$ of the flow. Our generalized formalism assures that
the shock formation is not just an artifact of a particular type of
gravitational potential, rather inclusion of all available black-hole
potentials demonstrates a substantially extended zone of parameter space
allowing for the possibility of shock formation. We thus arrive at the
conclusion that the standing shocks are essential ingredients in rotating,
advective accretion flows of isothermal fluid around a non-spinning
astrophysical black hole. Types of shocks discussed in this paper may appear to
be `bright' because of the huge amount of energy dissipation at shock, and the
quick removal of such energy to maintain the isothermality may power the strong
X-ray flares recently observed to be emerged from our Galactic centre.
  The results are discussed in connection to other astrophysical phenomena of
related interest, such as the QPO behaviour of galactic black hole candidates.

Both A- and B-like phases are considered. Two different types of behavior are
identified for the temperature dependence of the order parameter. We compare
the calculations with experiments on 3He in aerogel. We find that most of the
differences between experiments and the homogeneous theory can be explained by
the inhomogeneous model. All our calculations are based on the quasiclassical

that are instrumental for a dis-solution of the so-called {\it Hole Argument}
in general relativity. The work is carried through in metric gravity for the
class of Christoudoulou-Klainermann space-times, in which the temporal
evolution is ruled by the {\it weak} ADM energy. The main results of the
investigation are the following: 1) A re-interpretation of {\it active}
diffeomorphisms as {\it passive and metric-dependent} dynamical symmetries of
Einstein's equations, a re-interpretation that discloses their (up to now
unknown) connection to gauge transformations on-shell; understanding such
connection also enlightens the real content of the {\it Hole Argument}. 2) The
utilization of Bergmann-Komar {\it intrinsic coordinates} for a peculiar
gauge-fixing to the superhamiltonian and supermomentum constraints which
embodies on shell a {\it physical individuation} of the mathematical points of
$M^4$ as point-events in terms of the non-local intrinsic degrees of freedom of
the gravitational field (Dirac observables). 3) A clarification of the notion
of {\it Bergmann observable} that leads to a main conjecture asserting the
existence of i) special Dirac observables which are also Bergmann observables;
ii) tensorial (scalar) gauge variables.

that there is no initial cosmological singularity or ""beginning of time"".
Inflation with multiple vacua generically approaches a steady-state statistical
distribution of regions at these vacua, and our model follows directly from
making this distribution hold at all times. We find that this corresponds (at
the semi-classical level) to particularly simple cosmological boundary
conditions on an infinite null surface near which the spacetime looks de
Sitter. The model admits an interesting arrow of time that is well-defined and
consistent for all physical observers that can communicate, even while the
statistical description of the entire universe admits a symmetry that includes
time-reversal. Our model suggests, but does not require, the identification of
antipodal points on the manifold. The resulting ""elliptic"" de Sitter spacetime
has interesting classical and quantum properties. The proposal may be
generalized to other inflationary potentials, or to boundary conditions that
give semi-eternal but non-singular cosmologies.

invariant under space translation only by using a canonical approach based on
the recently developed Liouville-von Neumann formalism. The method is first
used to obtain the correlation functions both in and beyond the Hartree
approximation, for the quantum mechanical analog of the $\phi^{4}$ model. The
technique involves representing the Hamiltonian in a Fock basis of annihilation
and creation operators. By separating it into a solvable Gaussian part
involving quadratic terms and a perturbation of quartic terms, it is possible
to find the improved vacuum state to any desired order. The correlation
functions for the field theory are then investigated in the Hartree
approximation and those beyond the Hartree approximation are obtained by
finding the improved vacuum state corrected up to ${\cal O}(\lambda^2)$. These
correlation functions take into account next-to-leading and
next-to-next-to-leading order effects in the coupling constant. We also use the
Heisenberg formalism to obtain the time evolution equations for the equal-time,
connected correlation functions beyond the leading order. These equations are
derived by including the connected 4-point functions in the hierarchy. The
resulting coupled set of equations form a part of infinite hierarchy of coupled
equations relating the various connected n-point functions. The connection with
other approaches based on the path integral formalism is established and the
physical implications of the set of equations are discussed with particular
emphasis on thermalization.

many cases resembling what physicists have found in other nonbiological
systems. Here we describe the foraging patterns of free-ranging spider monkeys
(Ateles geoffroyi) in the forest of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico and find that
these patterns resemble what physicists know as Levy walks. First, the length
of a trajectory s constituent steps, or continuous moves in the same direction,
is best described by a power-law distribution in which the frequency of ever
larger steps decreases as a negative power function of their length. The rate
of this decrease is very close to that predicted by a previous analytical Levy
walk model to be an optimal strategy to search for scarce resources distributed
at random Viswanathan et al 1999). Second, the frequency distribution of the
duration of stops or waiting times also approximates a power-law function.
Finally, the mean square displacement during the monkeys first foraging trip
increases more rapidly than would be expected from a random walk with constant
step length, but within the range predicted for Levy walks. In view of these
results, we analyze the different exponents characterizing the trajectories
described by females and males, and by monkeys on their own or when part of a
subgroup. We discuss the origin of these patterns and their implications for
the foraging ecology of spider monkeys.

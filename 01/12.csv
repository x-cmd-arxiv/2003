G292.0+1.8 with the Chandra X-ray observatory. This SNR contains the 135 ms
pulsar, J1124-5916. We apply non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) models to the
data. By comparing the derived abundances with those predicted from
nucleosynthesis models, we estimate a progenitor mass of 30-40 solar masses. We
also derive the intrinsic parameters of the supernova explosion such as its
energy, the age of the SNR, the blast wave velocity, and the swept-up mass. In
the Sedov interpretation, our estimated SNR age of 2,600 years is close to the
pulsar's characteristic age of 2,900 years. This confirms the pulsar/SNR
association and relaxes the need for the pulsar to have a non-canonical value
for the braking index, a large period at birth or a large transverse velocity.
We discuss the properties of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) in the light of the
Kennel and Coroniti model and estimate the pulsar wind magnetization parameter.
We also report the first evidence for steepening of the power law spectral
index with increasing radius from the pulsar.

  differences are minor","New Astron. 8 (2003) 267-281","10.1016/S1384-1076(02)00238-5",,"astro-ph",,"  We present deep, high velocity resolution (1.6 km/s) GMRT HI as well as
optical data for the faint (M_B ~ -10.9) galaxy Camelopardalis B. We find that
the HI in the galaxy has a regular velocity field, consistent with rotational
motion. The implied kinematical major axis is well aligned with the major axis
of both the HI and optical images. Cam B is the faintest known galaxy with such
relatively well behaved kinematics. From the HI velocity field we derive a
rotation curve for the galaxy. The peak (inclination corrected) rotation
velocity is only 7km/s, comparable to the observed velocity dispersion. After
correcting the observed rotation velocities for random motions (the ""asymmetric
drift"" correction) we find a corrected peak rotation velocity of ~ 20 km/s. On
fitting mass models to corrected rotation curve we find that the kinematics of
Cam B is well fit with a modified isothermal halo with central density $\rho_0$
approximately 12.0 $M_\odot$ pc$ ^{-3}$. This derived central density has only
a very weak dependence on the assumed M/L ratio of the stellar disk. We also
find that the corrected rotation curve cannot be fit with an NFW halo
regardless of the assumed M/L ratio. We compile from the literature a sample of
galaxies with rotation curves obtained from HI synthesis observations. From
this sample (which has an absolute magnitude range of ~ 12) we find (i) that
Cam B lies on the Tully-Fisher relation defined by these galaxies, provided we
use the corrected rotation velocity, and (ii) a weak trend for increasing halo
central density with decreasing galaxy size. Such a trend is expected in
hierarchical models of halo formation.

presence of close approaches between quasi-energies (either crossings or
avoided crossings). We consider here a driven two-level system, and study how
the locations of crossings in the quasi-energy spectrum alter as the field
parameters are changed. A perturbational scheme provides a direct connection
between the form of the driving field and the quasi-energies which is exact in
the limit of high frequencies. We firstly obtain relations for the
quasi-energies for some common types of applied field in the high-frequency
limit. We then show how the locations of the crossings drift as the frequency
is reduced, and find a simple empirical formula which describes this drift
extremely well in general, and appears to be exact for the specific case of
square-wave driving.

satisfies Tsallis-type nonadditivity and the most general composable form is

This is consistent with the observation that the meta-equilibrium can be

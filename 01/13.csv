very detailed master pulse profile for energies 2 - 20 keV. We confirm the
broad single-pulse shape with a dip in the middle and with a significant fine
structure to the left of the dip. For the first time pulse profiles in the 10 -
50 keV energy interval are shown. Remarkably, the coarse pulse shape is stable
from the optical up to X-ray energies analogous to the case of the Crab pulsar
(PSR B0531+21). The profiles can be described with two Gaussians with a phase
separation of ~0.2; the distribution of the ratios between the two components
from the optical to the X-ray range is consistent with being flat. Therefore we
cannot conclude that the profile consists of two distinct components. We also
derived a new total pulsed spectrum in the ~0.01 - 50 keV range in a consistent
analysis including also archival ROSAT PSPC (0.01 - 2.5 keV) data. This
spectrum cannot be described by a single power-law, but requires an additional
energy dependent term. The bending of the spectrum around 10 keV resembles that
of the Crab pulsar spectrum. Although model calculations using Outer Gap
scenarios could probably explain the high-energy characteristics of PSR
B0540-69 as they successfully do for the Crab, our measurements do not entirely
agree with the latest calculations by Zhang & Cheng (2000). The small
discrepancies are likely to be caused by uncertainties in the pulsar's

  A comparison with the previous 43 GHz VLBA observations (Garrett et al. 1997)
made 8 months earlier show even larger deviations in the separation of up to
201 micro arcsec. The measured changes are most likely produced by changes in
the brightness distribution of the background source, enhanced by the
magnification of the lens. A relative magnification matrix that is applicable
on the milliarcsecond scale has been determined by relating two vectors (the
``core-jet'' separations and the offsets of the polarised and total intensity
emission) in the two lensed images. The determinant of this matrix,
  -1.13 +/-0.61, is in good agreement with the measured flux density ratio of

strong evidence for sub-structure in the lens and may require more realistic

spectra of starburst galaxies. The observation apertures were centred on
actively star forming regions, including those which are inaccessible at
optical wavelengths due to high levels of obscuration. We use this data set,
which includes fine structure and hydrogen recombination lines, to investigate
excitation and to derive gas phase abundances of neon, argon, and sulphur of
the starburst galaxies. The derived Ne abundances span approximately an order
of magnitude, up to values of ~3 times solar. The excitation ratios measured
from the Ne and Ar lines correlate well with each other (positively) and with
abundances (negatively). Both in excitation and abundance, a separation of
objects with visible Wolf-Rayet features (high excitation, low abundance) is
noted from those without (low excitation, high abundance). For a given
abundance, the starbursts are of relatively lower excitation than a comparative
sample of HII regions, possibly due to ageing stellar populations. By
considering the abundance ratios of S with Ne and Ar we find that, in our
higher metallicity systems, S is relatively underabundant by a factor of ~3. We
discuss the origin of this deficit and favour depletion of S onto dust grains
as a likely explanation. This weakness of the MIR fine structure lines of S has
ramifications for future infrared missions such as SIRTF and Herschel since it
indicates that the S lines are less favourable tracers of star formation than

take place below the convective zone. Here we apply this theory to the case of

a high energy cut-off power-law with a photon index in the range of 0.7-1.0 and
an iron emission line. In the low state, the spectrum is found to be flatter
with power-law photon index in the range 0.5-0.7. A direct correlation is

be highly variable during low intensity state, whereas it remains almost
constant during the high intensity state of the super-orbital period. It is
observed that the spectral variations in LMC X-4 are similar to those of Her

depth (<0.08 mag) flat-bottomed transits. For each of these objects several
individual transits were detected and photometric elements were determined.
Also lower limits on radii of the primary and companion were calculated. The

There is a group of planetary candidates with the orbital periods close to or

extrasolar planets, brown dwarfs, or M-type dwarfs. One should be, however,
aware that in some cases unresolved blends of regular eclipsing stars can mimic
transits. Future spectral analysis and eventual determination of the amplitude

it is possible to create the horizon on the quantum-liquid analog of the brane,

quasistationary object. Using this analogy we calculate the Bekenstein entropy

are associated in [FRTa] and [FRTb] to any Yang-Baxter operator R. The latter
is only a bialgebra, in general; the former is a Hopf algebra.
  In this paper, we study the pointed Hopf algebras $U(R_Q)$, where $R_Q$ is
the Yang-Baxter operator associated with the multi-parameter deformation of
$GL_n$ supplied in [AST]; cf also [S,Re].
  Some earlier results concerning these Hopf algebras $U(R_Q)$ were obtained in
[To,CLMT,CM]; a related (but different) Hopf algebra was studied in [DP].
  The main new results obtained here concerning these quantum enveloping
algebras are: 1)We list, in an extremely explicit form, those quantum
enveloping algebras $U(R_Q)$ which are finite-dimensional--let ${\mathcal U}$
denote the collection of these. 2)We verify that the pointed Hopf algebras in
${\mathcal U}$ are quasitriangular and of Cartan type $A_n$ in the sense of
Andruskiewich-Schneider.
  3)We show that every $U(R_Q)$ is a Hopf quotient of a double cross-product
(hence, as asserted in 2), is quasitriangular if finite-dimensional.) 4)
CAUTION: These Hopf algebras are NOT always cocycle twists of the standard
1-parameter deformation. This somewhat surprising fact is an immediate
consequence of the data furnished here-- clearly a cocycle twist will not
convert an infinite-dimensional Hopf algebra to a finite-dimensional one!
Furthermore, these Hopf algebras in ${\mathcal U}$ are (it is proved) not all
cocycle twists of each other. 5)We discuss also the case when the quantum
determinant is central in $A(R_Q)$, so it makes sense to speak of a
$Q$-deformation of the special linear group.

all, we aim to determine the sensitivity needed to provide significant limits.
Our analysis puts in evidence that there is a class of DE models that
polarization measures can possibly exclude soon. This class includes models
with DE due to a Ratra-Peebles (RP) potential. Using a likelihood analysis, we
show that it is possible to distinguish RP models from LCDM and other dynamical
DE models, already with the sensitivity of experiments like SPOrt or WMAP,
thanks to their negative TE correlation at low-l, when the optical depth tau is
sufficiently large. On the contrary, fixing the energy scale Lambda for RP
potentials or distinguishing between LCDM and other DE potentials requires a
much lower pixel noise, that no planned polarization experiment will achieve.
While reviewing this paper after the referee report, the first-year WMAP data
were released. WMAP finds large positive anisotropy-polarization correlations
at low l; this apparently excludes DE models with RP potentials.

our results and the Hipparcos ones for the Hyades and Praesepe. For the
Pleiades and NGC 2516, when adopting the solar abundance determined from
spectroscopy, we find significant disagreement at a level similar to that found
by other MS-fitting studies. However, the colour-colour relationship for both
these clusters suggests that their metallicity is significantly subsolar. Since
the MS-fitting method relies on matching the cluster colours to a template MS,
we argue that, when applying this method, the appropriate metallicity to adopt
is the photometric subsolar one, not the solar abundance indicated by
spectroscopy. Adopting photometric metallicities for all 4 clusters, we find
complete agreement with the Hipparcos results and hence we conclude that the
mismatch between the spectroscopic and photometric abundances for the Pleiades

NGC 1399, the central galaxy in the Fornax cluster, in Washington C and Kron R
filters within a field of 36'x36'. This is the largest area around this galaxy
ever studied with CCD photometry. The cluster system of NGC 1399 is found to
extend further than 100 kpc away from the galaxy. The color distribution
exhibits a pronounced bimodality. Within a radial distance of about 55 kpc, the
red clusters are more strongly concentrated to the center than the
blueclusters. At larger radii, the surface density profiles of the clusters are
indistinguishable and match well the distribution of the galaxy light. Over the
entire radial distance range, the surface brightness profile of NGC 1399 can be
very well fitted by a power law with an exponent of -1.85 and a core radius of
3.3"". No steepening of the luminosity profile can be detected at large radii.
We suggest that the power law profile of NGC 1399 results from the galaxy being
embedded in a large dark matter halo, which prevents the stellar density
profile from steepening outwards. The cluster system contains 6450+-700
clusters and the specific frequency is found to be 5.1+-1.2 in the V band.
While NGC 1399 shows a pronounced color gradient. Using simple assumptions
about the underlying population that formed during the same star formation
event as the globular clusters, we presenta model in which we use radially
changing local specific frequencies for the red and blue subpopulations to fit
the observations. We find that within 7' the required specific frequency of the
blue clusters alone is a factor of approximately 3 larger than that of the red
ones. Outside this radius however, both populations have a high local specific
frequency of around 10.

simulated in the Lambda CDM scenario. The morphology of the galaxy evolves
dramatically over time in response to the mode and timing of mass accretion;
smooth deposition of cooled gas leads to the formation of centrifugally
supported disks, whilst major mergers disperse stellar disks into spheroids.
These two modes of accretion alternate successively until z~0.6, when the
galaxy undergoes one last major (1:2) merger that consumes much of the
remaining gas into stars. Little gas cools and accretes subsequently and, as a
result, most stars at z=0 are in a spheroidal component that resembles
present-day elliptical galaxies. Dynamically, the galaxy is well approximated
by an E4 oblate rotator. Boxy isophotes are obtained when the galaxy is seen
face-on and Vrot/sigma<<1. On the other hand, disky isophotes are found for
inclinations which maximize Vrot/sigma. The line-of-sight velocity distribution
is nearly Gaussian at all radii. The sign of the Gauss-Hermite skewness
parameter h3 is anti-correlated with the apparent sense of rotation, in
agreement with observed trends. The simulated galaxy has much higher effective
surface brightness than normal ellipticals of similar luminosity, in a way
reminiscent of the less common type of compact ellipticals. Our simulation
shows that repeated episodes of dissipational collapse, followed by merger
events, lead to stellar spheroids that are only mildly triaxial and of
relatively simple kinematic structure. This is in better agreement with
observation than earlier models based on dissipationless mergers of stellar
disks, and a positive step towards reconciling the observed structure of
ellipticals with the hierarchical merging scenario.

microquasars GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40 in practice only allow us to place
lower limits on the Lorentz factors of the outflows. As a consequence, it is
not possible to rule out the possibility that jets from X-ray binaries are just
as relativistic as those from active galactic nuclei (AGN). This results from
the fact that distance estimates place the sources, within uncertainties, at
the maximum distance d(max) which corresponds to an intrinsic velocity v=c. The
general case is explored, for a range of intrinsic Lorentz factors and angles
to the line of sight, and it is shown that a source of significantly
relativistic jets will nearly always be observed close to d(max) and as a
result it is unlikely that we will ever be able to measure with any accuracy
the Lorentz factor of a jet from two-sided proper motions. We will generally
not be able to do more than place a lower limit on the Lorentz factor of the
flow, and this limit is naturally even lower in the cases where we only observe
the approaching jet. On the other hand, under the assumption that any two-sided
jets we see are intrinsically relativistic, we can confidently place the source
at a distance d ~ d(max). As a result, observations of two-sided proper motions
in relativistic jets from AGN would be extremely important for calibration of
the cosmological distance scale. (ABRIDGED).

high iron abundance, and estimated age of 2 - 3Gyr. By assuming the lower limit
for this age estimate and the latest measurements of the Hubble parameter as
given by the HST key project, we study some cosmological implications from the
existence of this object. In particular, we derive new limits on the dark
matter and vacuum energy contribution. Our analysis is also extended to
quintessence scenarios in which the dark energy is parameterized by a smooth
component with an equation of state $p_x = \omega_x \rho_x$ ($-1\leq \omega_x <
0$). For flat models with a relic cosmological constant we show that the vacuum
energy density parameter is constrained to be $\Omega_\Lambda \geq 0.78$, a
result that is marginally compatible with recent observations from type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) and cosmic microwave background (CMB). For quintessence
scenarios the same analysis restricts the cosmic parameter to $\omega_x \leq
-0.22$. Limits on a possible first epoch of quasar formation are also briefly
discussed. The existence of this object pushes the formation era back to
extremely high redshifts.

energy distribution of blazars, particularly flat-spectrum radio quasars
(FSRQ). This reassessment is prompted by the discovery of a population of FSRQ
with spectral energy distribution similar to that of high-energy peaked BL
Lacs. The fraction of these sources is sample dependent, being ~ 10% in DXRBS
and ~ 30% in RGB (and reaching ~ 80% for the Einstein Medium Sensitivity
Survey). We show that these ``X-ray strong'' radio quasars, which had gone
undetected or unnoticed in previous surveys, indeed are the strong-lined
counterparts of high-energy peaked BL Lacs and have synchrotron peak
frequencies, nu_peak, much higher than ``classical'' FSRQ, typically in the UV
band for DXRBS. Some of these objects may be 100 GeV - TeV emitters, as are
several known BL Lacs with similar broadband spectra. Our large, deep, and
homogeneous DXRBS sample does not show anti-correlations between nu_peak and
radio, broad line region, or jet power, as expected in the so-called ``blazar
sequence'' scenario. However, the fact that FSRQ do not reach X-ray-to-radio
flux ratios and nu_peak values as extreme as BL Lacs and the elusiveness of
high nu_peak - high-power blazars suggest that there might be an intrinsic,
physical limit to the synchrotron peak frequency that can be reached by
strong-lined, powerful blazars. Our findings have important implications for
the study of jet formation and physics and its relationship to other properties

spectroscopic properties of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). The database of almost
1000 LBG spectra proves useful for constructing high S/N composite spectra. The
composite spectrum of the entire sample reveals a wealth of features
attributable to hot stars, HII regions, dust, and outflowing neutral and
ionized gas. By grouping the database according to galaxy parameters such as
Lyman-alpha equivalent width, UV spectral slope, and interstellar kinematics,
we isolate some of the major trends in LBG spectra which are least compromised
by selection effects. We find that LBGs with stronger Lyman-alpha emission have
bluer UV continua, weaker low-ionization interstellar absorption lines, smaller
kinematic offsets between Lyman-alpha and the interstellar absorption lines,
and lower star-formation rates. There is a decoupling between the dependence of
low- and high-ionization outflow features on other spectral properties. Most of
the above trends can be explained in terms of the properties of the large-scale
outflows seen in LBGs. According to this scenario, the appearance of LBG
spectra is determined by a combination of the covering fraction of outflowing
neutral gas which contains dust, and the range of velocities over which this
gas is absorbing. Higher sensitivity and spectral resolution observations are
still required for a full understanding of the covering fraction and velocity
dispersion of the outflowing neutral gas in LBGs, and its relationship to the
escape fraction of Lyman continuum radiation in galaxies at z~3.

the distribution and use it to constrain the effect of the IR color
distribution on evolution models for high redshift, farIR luminous galaxies.
Our adopted evolution retains the locally observed correlation between
luminosity and color, such that the larger characteristic luminosities at
higher redshift have a warmer characteristic color. The width of the color
distribution at a given luminosity remains constant for all redshifts. We
demonstrate that there is the potential for both hotter and colder sources to
be missed in cosmological surveys. An evolving bi-variate luminosity function
coupled with the cold source bias of sub-mm selected surveys suggests the
existence of a large population of cold sources appearing in such surveys.
Likewise, a hot source bias for most SIRTF wavebands together with a bi-variate
model suggests an excess of hot sources being selected. We test the
evolutionary form against available data for higher redshift, farIR galaxies.
The data do not reveal evidence for any strong evolution in the characteristic
luminosity-color distribution as a function of redshift over 0<z<1. However,
there is marginal evidence for a broadening of the color distribution at higher

result from a tenuous absorption component that is anticorrelated with large

this effectively rules out the possibility that intergalactic HI absorption is
very important, and it is concluded that most if not all of the steepening is
intrinsic to quasars. A smaller flux discontinuity of order 1% cannot, however,
be ruled out yet and would still be consistent with the warm-hot intergalactic

V-brightness dimmed by about a full magnitude. The star recovered from this
deep minimum by 2001 April. It is the third outburst of Rho Cas on record in
the last century. We observe TiO absorption bands in high-resolution near-IR
spectra obtained with the Utrecht Echelle Spectrograph during the summer of

minimum. Atmospheric models reveal that the effective temperature decreases by
at least 3000 K, and the TiO shell is driven supersonically with Mdot ~= 5.4

of a low-temperature, optically thick circumstellar gas shell of 3 10^{-2} Msun

pulsating massive supergiant near the Eddington luminosity limit. We observe
that the mass-loss rate during the outburst is of the same order of magnitude
as has been proposed for the outbursts of Eta Carinae. We present calculations
that correctly predict the outburst time-scale, whereby the shell ejection is
driven by the release of hydrogen ionization-recombination energy.

methods based on image shape parameters have been extensively used for the data
from imaging telescopes. However, non-imaging Cerenkov telescopes have to
develop very different means of statistically identifying and removing cosmic
ray events. Some of the parameters which could be potentially important for
non-imaging arrays are the temporal and spectral differences, the lateral
distributions and density fluctuations of Cerenkov photons generated by gamma
ray and hadron primaries. Here we study the differences in fluctuations of
Cerenkov photon density in the light pool at the observation level from showers
initiated by photons and those initiated by protons or heavier nuclei. The
database of simulated events for the PACT array has been used to evaluate the
efficiency of the new technique. Various types of density fluctuations like the

studied. The estimated quality factors reflect the efficiencies with which the

independent, the cuts may be applied in tandem and we demonstrate that the

and clusters and the predictions from current hydrodynamical simulations. These
are particularly pronounced in the central regions of galaxies and clusters.
The popular NFW (Navarro, Frenk, and White) profile, for example, predicts a
density cusp at the center, a behavior that (unsurprisingly) has not been
observed. While it is not fully clear what are the reasons for this
discrepancy, it perhaps reflects (at least partly) insufficient spatial
resolution of the simulations. In this paper we explore a purely
phenomenological approach to determine dark matter density profiles that are
more consistent with observational results. Specifically, we deduce the gas
density distribution from measured X-ray brightness profiles, and substitute it
in the hydrostatic equilibrium equation in order to derive the form of dark
matter profiles. Given some basic theoretical requirements from a dark matter
profile, we then consider a number of simple profiles that have the desired
asymptotic form. We conclude that a dark matter density profile of the form

companion to the eclipsing X-ray pulsar Vela X-1. Using data spanning more than
two complete orbits of the system, we detect evidence for tidally induced
non-radial oscillations on the surface of GP Vel, apparent as peaks in the
power spectrum of the residuals to the radial velocity curve fit. By removing
the effect of these oscillations (to first order) and binning the radial
velocities, we have determined the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve
of GP Vel to be K_o=22.6+/-1.5 km/s. Given the accurately measured
semi-amplitude of the pulsar's orbit, the mass ratio of the system is
0.081+/-0.005. We are able to set upper and lower limits on the masses of the
component stars as follows. Assuming GP Vel fills its Roche lobe then the
inclination angle of the system, i=70.1+/-2.6 deg. In this case we obtain the
masses of the two stars as M_x=2.27 +/-0.17 M_sun for the neutron star and
M_o=27.9+/-1.3 M_sun for GP Vel. Conversely, assuming the inclination angle is
i=90 deg, the ratio of the radius of GP Vel to the radius of its Roche lobe is
beta=0.89+/-0.03 and the masses of the two stars are M_x=1.88+/-0.13 M_sun and
M_o=23.1+/-0.2 M_sun. A range of solutions between these two sets of limits is
also possible, corresponding to other combinations of i and beta. In addition,
we note that if the zero phase of the radial velocity curve is allowed as a
free parameter, rather than constrained by the X-ray ephemeris, a significantly
improved fit is obtained with an amplitude of 21.2+/-0.7 km/s and a phase shift
of 0.033+/-0.007 in true anomaly. The apparent shift in the zero phase of the

0.22-0.32 Msun, the inclination of the system is constrained within 56 deg <= i
<= 47 deg and the Roche lobe radius is r_RL ~ 1.5-1.7 Rsun. A preliminary
chemical abundance analysis confirms that COM J1740-5340 has a metallicity
compatible with that measured for other stars in this metal-poor globular, but
the unexpected detection of strong He I absorption lines implies the existence
of regions at T>10,000 K, significantly warmer than the rest of the star. The
intensity of this line correlates with the orbital phase, suggesting the
presence of a region on the companion surface, heated by the millisecond pulsar
flux.

discovery in 1964. It was found to be an X-ray burster twenty years ago proving
that the compact object in this system is a neutron star. The burst rate is so
low that only 18 bursts were reported prior to 1996. The Wide Field Cameras on
BeppoSAX have, through a dedicated monitoring program on the Galactic center
region, increased the number of X-ray bursts from GX 3+1 by 61. Since GX 3+1
exhibits a slow (order of years) modulation in the persistent flux of about
50%, these observations opens up the unique possibility to study burst
properties as a function of mass accretion rate for very low burst rates. This
is the first time that bursts are detected from GX 3+1 in the high state. From
the analysis we learn that all bursts are short with e-folding decay times
smaller than 10 s. Therefore, all bursts are due to unstable helium burning.
Furthermore, the burst rate drops sixfold in a fairly narrow range of 2-20 keV
flux; we discuss possible origins for this.

different from other isolated Herbig Ae/Be stars in both the strength of the

the formation and spatial distribution of the crystalline dust observed in the
HD 100546 system may be linked to the formation of a proto-Jupiter in the disk
around HD 100546. Such a proto-Jupiter could gravitationally stir the disk
leading to a collisional cascade of asteroidal sized objects producing small
crystalline grains, or it could cause shocks by tidal interaction with the disk
which might produce crystalline dust grains through flash heating. As shown by
Malfait et al. (1998), the infrared spectrum of HD 100546 is very similar to
that of C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp (Crovisier et al. 1997). Using an identical
methodology, we have therefore also studied this solar system comet. Both
objects have an almost identical grain composition, but with the important
difference that the individual dust species in Hale-Bopp are in thermal contact
with each other, while this is not the case in HD 100546. This suggests that if
similar processes leading to the dust composition as seen in HD 100546 also
occurred in our own solar system, that Hale-Bopp formed after the formation of
one or more proto-gas giants.

populations in IZw18 older than this, although as much as 22% of the stellar

widespread and inhomogeneously distributed ionized gas and dust. Ionized gas
emission is important in every region examined except the NW star cluster.

in interpreting the key observations about gamma ray bursts. There still
remains, however, some big uncertainties. The hottest issue concerns the nature
of the progenitor, but there are also other problems concerning the global
energetics, coupled with the issue of the degree of the collimation of the
fireball. To be efficient, internal shocks within the relativistic wind must
occur with large contrasts of their bulk Lorentz factors, and it is not clear
yet the role of the Compton drag process in limiting the velocity differences.
The fireball itself can be ""hot"" or ""cold"" according to what accelerates it to
ultrarelativistic bulk speeds. In this respect the recent observations of a
black body shape of the early phases of a few bursts shed new light on this
issue. The most popular radiation process thought to explain the prompt
emission is synchrotron, but it faces severe problems when comparing the
expected spectrum with observations. Alternatives are called for. Emission
features in the X-ray afterglow and absorption features in the prompt spectra
are a powerful diagnostical tool. Besides shedding light on the nature of the

agreement with the profiles observed in the nuclei of galaxies fainter than
visual magnitude -20. However the shallow nuclear profiles of bright galaxies
require a different explanation. Binary black holes are an inevitable result of
galactic mergers, and the ejection of stars by a massive binary displaces a
mass of order the binary's own mass, creating a core or shallow power-law cusp.
This model is at least crudely consistent with core sizes in bright galaxies.

Universal features of the resultant non-equilibrium layers are predicted. Two
cases are considered, distinguished by the value of the local monomer-surface

Early stages of layer formation entail single chain adsorption. While single
chain physisorption times tau_ads are typically microsecs, for chemisorbing
chains of N units we find experimentally accessible times tau_ads = Q^{-1}
N^{3/5}, ranging from secs to hrs. We establish 3 chemisorption universality
classes, determined by a critical contact exponent: zipping, accelerated
zipping and homogeneous collapse. For dilute solutions, the mechanism is
accelerated zipping: zipping propagates outwards from the first attachment,
accelerated by occasional formation of large loops which nucleate further
zipping. This leads to a transient distribution omega(s) \sim s^{-7/5} of loop
lengths s up to a size s_max \approx (Q t)^{5/3} after time t. By tau_ads the
entire chain is adsorbed. The outcome of the single chain adsorption episode is
a monolayer of fully collapsed chains. Having only a few vacant sites to adsorb
onto, late arriving chains form a diffuse outer layer. In a simple picture we
find for both chemisorption and physisorption a final loop distribution
Omega(s) \sim s^{-11/5} and density profile c(z) \sim z^{-4/3} whose forms are
the same as for equilibrium layers. In contrast to equilibrium layers, however,
the statistical properties of a given chain depend on its adsorption time; the
outer layer contains many classes of chain, each characterized by different
fraction of adsorbed monomers f. Consistent with strong physisorption
experiments, we find the f values follow a distribution P(f) \sim f^{-4/5}.

that every pair emerges from vacuum configurations which are torn apart so as

that of its `partner'. The partner's current lives behind the Hubble horizon
centered around the particle. Hence any measurement performed within a Hubble
patch would correspond to an uncorrelated density matrix, as for Hawking
radiation. However, when inflation stops, the Hubble radius grows and
eventually encompasses the partner. When this is realized the coherence is
recovered within a patch. Our analysis applies to rare pair creation events as
well as to cases leading to arbitrary high occupation numbers. Hence it might
be applied to primordial gravitational waves which evolve into highly squeezed

Special emphasis is on the occurrence of a diquark condensate which signals a
phase transition to color superconductivity and its effects on the equation of
state. We calculate the quark star configurations by solving the Tolman-
Oppenheimer- Volkoff equations and obtain for the transition from a hot, normal
quark matter core of a protoneutron star to a cool diquark condensed one a
release of binding energy of the order of Delta M c^2 ~ 10^{53} erg. We study
the consequences of antineutrino trapping in hot quark matter for quark star
configurations with possible diquark condensation and discuss the claim that
this energy could serve as an engine for explosive phenomena. A ""phase diagram""
for rotating compact stars (angular velocity-baryon mass plane) is suggested as
a heuristic tool for obtaining constraints on the equation of state of QCD at
high densities. It has a critical line dividing hadronic from quark core stars
which is correlated with a local maximum of the moment of inertia and can thus
be subject to experimental verification by observation of the rotational
behavior of accreting compact stars.

reasonable doubts that the phase transition separating the Coulomb from the
confined phase is of first order, albeit a very weak one. This settles the
issue from the numerical side. On the analytical side, it was suggested some
time ago, based on the qualitative analogy between the phase diagram of such a
model and the one of scalar QED obtained by soft breaking the N=2
Seiberg-Witten model down to N=0, that the phase transition should be of second
order. In this work we take a fresh look at this issue and show that a proper
implementation of the Seiberg-Witten model below the supersymmetry breaking
scale requires considering some new radiative corrections. Through the
Coleman-Weinberg mechanism this turns the second order transition into a weakly
first order one, in agreement with the numerical results. We comment on several
other aspects of this continuum model.

connections to graph theory, equiangular line sets, and coding theory in order
to derive explicit constructions of Grassmannian frames. Our findings extend
recent results on uniform tight frames. We then introduce infinite-dimensional
Grassmannian frames and analyze their connection to uniform tight frames for
frames which are generated by group-like unitary systems. We derive an example

  Equations","16 pages, 8 figures, 1 table. Published in Journal of Mathematical
  Physics","Journal of Mathematical Physics, 1999, vol. 40, page 5224",,,"math.AP math-ph math.MP",,"  Integro-partial differential equations occur in many contexts in mathematical
physics. Typical examples include time-dependent diffusion equations containing
a parameter (e.g., the temperature) that depends on integrals of the unknown
distribution function. The standard approach to solving the resulting nonlinear
partial differential equation involves the use of predictor-corrector
algorithms, which often require many iterations to achieve an acceptable level
of convergence. In this paper we present an alternative procedure that allows
us to separate a family of integro-partial differential equations into two
related problems, namely (i) a perturbation equation for the temperature, and
(ii) a linear partial differential equation for the distribution function. We
demonstrate that the variation of the temperature can be determined by solving
the perturbation equation before solving for the distribution function.
Convergent results for the temperature are obtained by recasting the divergent
perturbation expansion as a continued fraction. Once the temperature variation
is determined, the self-consistent solution for the distribution function is
obtained by solving the remaining, linear partial differential equation using
standard techniques. The validity of the approach is confirmed by comparing the
(input) continued-fraction temperature profile with the (output) temperature
computed by integrating the resulting distribution function.

linear passive bath. It is exact within the assumption that the oscillator and
bath are initially uncoupled . Here an exact general solution is obtained in
the form of an expression for the Wigner function at time t in terms of the
initial Wigner function. The result is applied to the motion of a Gaussian wave
packet and to that of a pair of such wave packets. A serious divergence arising
from the assumption of an initially uncoupled state is found to be due to the
zero-point oscillations of the bath and not removed in a cutoff model. As a
consequence, worthwhile results for the equation can only be obtained in the
high temperature limit, where zero-point oscillations are neglected. In that
limit closed form expressions for wave packet spreading and attenuation of

those appearing in the literature, which apply for the case of a particle at

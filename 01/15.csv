by horizontal turbulence in rotating stars. This new estimate can be up to two
orders of magnitude larger than given by a previous expression. As a
consequence the differential rotation on an equipotential is found to be very
small, which reinforces Zahn's hypothesis of shellular rotation. The role of
the so--called $\mu$--currents, as well as the driving of circulation, are
reduced by the large horizontal turbulence. Stellar evolutionary models for a
20 M${\odot}$ star are calculated with the new coefficient. The new and large
$D_{\mathrm{h}}$ tends to limit the size of the convective core and at the same
time it largely favours the diffusion of helium and nitrogen to the surface of
rotating OB stars, a feature supported by recent observations.

position angle of the polarization and the local amount of Faraday Rotation.
The most plausible explanation is that most or all of the rotation is local to
the source. We suggest that the rotations local to cluster radio galaxies may
result from either thermal material mixed with the radio plasma, or from thin
skins of warm, ionized gas in pressure balance with the observed galaxy or hot
cluster atmospheres. We find that the contribution of any unrelated cluster
Rotation Measure variations on scales of 2 - 10 arcsec are less than 25
rad/m^2; the standard, although model dependent, derivation of cluster fields
would then lead to an upper limit of approximately 0.4 microGauss on these
scales. Inspection of the distributions of Rotation Measure, polarisation angle
and total intensity in 3C75, 3C465 and Cygnus A also shows source-related
Faraday effects in some locations. Many effects can mask the signatures of
locally-dominated RMs, so the detection of even isolated correlations can be
important, although difficult to quantify statistically. In order to use radio
sources such as shown here to derive {\it cluster-wide} magnetic fields, as is
commonly done, one must first remove the local contributions; this is not
possible at present.

filters (F255W, F336W). The selected sample covers a large range in both
central density and metallicity ([Fe/H]). In this paper, we present a direct
cluster-to-cluster comparison of the Blue Stragglers Stars (BSS) population as
selected from (m_{255},m_{255}-m_{336}) Color Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs). We
have found:(a) BSS in three of the clusters (M3, M80, M92) are much more
concentrated toward the center of the cluster than the red giants; because of
the smaller BSS samples for the other clusters we can only note that the BSS
radial distributions are consistent with central concentration; (b) the
specific frequency of BSS varies greatly from cluster to cluster.
  The most interesting result is that the two clusters with largest BSS
specific frequency are at the central density extremes of our sample: NGC 288
(lowest central density) and M80 (highest). This evidence together with the
comparison with theoretical collisional models suggests that both stellar
interactions in high density cluster cores and at least one other alternate
channel operating low density GGCs play an important role in the production of
BSS. We also note a possible connection between HB morphology and blue
straggler luminosity functions in these six clusters.

of conversion of particles from the charged state (protons or
electrons/positrons) into neutral state (neutrons or photons) and back. In most
cases, the conversion is photon-induced and requires presence of intense
radiation fields, but the converter acceleration mechanism may also operate via
inelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions.
  Like in the traditional model -- ``stochastic'' (or diffusive) acceleration,
-- the acceleration cycle in our scenario consists of escape of particles from
the relativistic flow followed by their return back after deflection from the
ambient magnetic field. The difference is that the charge-changing reactions,
which occur during the cycle, allow accelerated particles to increase their
energies in each cycle by a factor roughly equal to the bulk Lorentz factor
squared.
  The emerging spectra of accelerated particles can be very hard and their
cut-off energy in some cases is larger than in the standard mechanism. This
drastically reduces the required energy budget of the sources of the
highest-energy particles observed in cosmic rays. Also, the proposed
acceleration mechanism may serve as an efficient means of transferring the
energy of bulk motion to gamma-radiation and, if the accelerated particles are
nucleons, routinely produces high-energy neutrinos at $\sim 50 %$ relative
efficiency.

bell-shaped SBD disk-galaxy function which peaks near the canonical Freeman
value of 21.7 and then falls off significantly by 23.5 B mag arcsec-2. This is
in contradiction to previous studies which have typically found flat (slope=0)

10 hr. However, there is a strong correlation between L_{X,iso} and the beaming
fractions, f_b=[1-cos(\theta_j)]. As a result, the true X-ray luminosity of GRB
afterglows, L_X=f_b L_{X,iso}, is approximately constant, with a dispersion of
only a factor of two. Since \epsilon_e E_b \propto L_X, the strong clustering
of L_X directly implies that the adiabatic blastwave kinetic energy in the
afterglow phase, E_b, is tightly clustered. The narrow distribution of L_X also
suggests that p\approx 2, that inverse Compton emission does not in general
dominate the observed X-ray luminosity, and that radiative losses at t<10 hr
are relatively small. Thus, despite the large diversity in the observed
properties of GRBs and their afterglows the energy imparted by the GRB central

census of sources, which is sensitive enough to detect a 10 Mjup brown dwarf
seen through an extinction of Av=7mag. We examine the cluster's structure and
relationship to the molecular cloud and construct the cluster's K band
luminosity function. Using our model luminosity function algorithm, we derive
the cluster's initial mass function throughout the stellar and substellar
regimes and find that the IC 348 IMF is very similar to that found for the
Trapezium Cluster with both cluster IMFs having a mode between 0.2 - 0.08 Msun.
In particular we find that, similar to our results for the Trapezium, brown
dwarfs constitute only 1 in 4 of the sources in the IC 348 cluster. We show
that a modest secondary peak forms in the substellar IC 348 KLF, corresponding
to the same mass range responsible for a similar KLF peak found in the
Trapezium. We interpret this KLF peak as either evidence for a corresponding
secondary IMF peak at the deuterium burning limit, or as arising from a feature
in the substellar mass-luminosity relation that is not predicted by current
theoretical models. Lastly, we find that IC 348 displays radial variations of
its sub-solar (0.5 - 0.08 Msun) IMF on a parsec scale. Whatever mechanism that
is breaking the universality of the IMF on small spatial scales in IC 348 does
not appear to be acting upon the brown dwarf population, whose relative size
does not vary with distance from the cluster center.

We derive for each of the luminosity functions the expected source counts and

from the observed counts. In most cases the value of <V/Vmax> differs
substantially from the observed value of 0.34 for BATSE-based samples, with

the metallicity dependence of the PNLF cutoff is in excellent agreement with
that predicted from theory, and that no additional systematic corrections are
needed for either method. However, when we compare the Cepheid-calibrated PNLF

significant offset: although the relative distances of both methods are in
excellent agreement, the PNLF method produces results that are systematically
shorter by about 15%. We trace this discrepancy back to the calibration
galaxies and show how a small amount of internal reddening can lead to a very
large systematic error. Finally, we demonstrate how the PNLF and Cepheid

However, when applied to galaxy/group scales the synergistic combination of AGN
heating and conduction is less satisfactory. When the computed density profile

these smaller scale flows, the gas temperatures within about 10 kpc are too
large. In addition, best-fitting flows in galaxy/groups with AGN heating and
thermal conduction require larger conductivities, about 0.5 - 1.0 of the

heating, the iron enrichment by Type Ia supernovae is more effective and the
hot gas iron abundance greatly exceeds observed values. Consequently,
galactic/group flows with central heating and conduction require an additional
process that removes the iron: failure of Type Ia ejecta to go into the hot

chemically and electronically active. We find that if two neighboring tubes
have their impurities facing one another, an intertube covalent bond forms.
This finding opens an intriguing possibility for tunnel junctions, as well as
the functionalization of suitably doped carbon nanotubes by selectively forming
chemical bonds with ligands at the impurity site. If the intertube bond density
is high enough, a highly packed bundle of interlinked single-wall nanotubes can
form.

energy tails and different velocity components are correlated. In the freely
cooling case, the velocity distribution develops an algebraic high-energy tail,
with an exponent that depends sensitively on the dimension and the degree of

asymptotic behavior, and the autocorrelation function decays algebraically with

rate coefficients k_p in free radical polymerization. Various properties of PLP
have been established in previous works, mainly using numerical methods. The
objective of this paper is to obtain analytical results. We obtain the most
general analytical solution for the dead chain molecular weight distribution
(MWD) under low conversion conditions which has been hitherto obtained.
Simultaneous disproportionation and combination termination processes are
treated. The hallmarks of PLP are the dead MWD discontinuities located at
integer multiples of n_0 = k_p t_0 C_M, where t_0 is the laser period and C_M
is the monomer concentration. We show that chain transfer reduces their
amplitude by factors e^{-c_{tr} L n_0}, consistent with numerical results
obtained by other workers. Here c_{tr} is the chain transfer coefficient and L
is an integer. Additionally, transfer generates a small amplitude continuous
contribution to the MWD. These results generalize earlier analytical results
obtained for the case of disproportionation only. We also considered 2 classes
of broadening: (i) Poisson broadening of growing living chains and (ii)
intrinsic broadening by the MWD measuring equipment (typically gel permeation
chromatography, GPC). Broadening smoothes the MWD discontinuities. Under
typical PLP experimental conditions, the associated inflection points are very
close to the discontinuities of the unbroadened MWD. Previous numerical works
have indicated that the optimal procedure is to use the inflection point to
infer k_p. We prove that this is a correct procedure provided the GPC
resolution \sigma is better than n_0^{1/2}. Otherwise this underestimates L n_0
by an amount of order \sigma^2/n_0.

negatively charged n-doped systems, we observe that the g-factors for

susceptibility exhibits sharp resonances reminiscent of the behavior of single
spins. These results show that strongly interacting quantum systems can
organize to generate coherent excitations and shed light on recent experiments
demonstrating that coherent excitations are present in a disordered spin
liquid. The dependence of the energy spectra on system size differs
qualitatively from that of the energy spectra of random undirected bipartite
graphs with similar statistics, implying that strong interactions are giving
rise to these unusual spectral properties.

ancillary to their insulating behaviour. Our emphasis here is on disentangling
ordering from the intrinsic strongly correlated physics of a doped half-filled
band. To this end, we focus on the 2D Hubbard model. Because the charge gap
arises from on-site correlations, we implement a non-perturbative approach
which incorporates local physics. Crucial to this method is a self-consistent
two-site dynamical cluster expansion which builds in the nearest-neighbour
energy scale, $J$.
  At half-filling, we find that the spectral function possesses a gap of order
$U$ and is devoid of any coherent quasi-particle peaks. In the doped case, we
find that the Fermi surface exceeds the Luttinger volume. Additionally in the
underdoped regime, we find that a pseudogap opens in the single particle
density of states.The pseudogap closes above optimal doping and hence our
proposal is not inconsistent with that of Loram. In analogy with the Mott gap
and antiferromagnetism, we propose that ordering may also accompany the
formation of a pseudogap. We suggest a current pattern within a 1-band model
that preserves translational but breaks time-reversal symmetry along the
canonical x and y axes but not along $x=\pm y$ that is consistent with the
experimental observations. Finally, we show that the Hall coefficient in a
doped Mott insulator must change sign at a doping level $x<1/3$. The sign
change is tied to a termination of strong correlation physics in the doped Mott
state.

interpretation dictates that self-avoidance should be enforced in the continuum

continuum models with self-avoidance frequently employ pairwise repulsive
potentials, which are of necessity singular. Moreover the potentials do not
have an intrinsic length scale appropriate for modelling the finite thickness
of the physical systems. Here we develop a framework for modelling
self-avoiding strands and sheets which avoids singularities, and which provides
a way to introduce a thickness length scale. In our approach pairwise
interaction potentials are replaced by many-body potentials involving three or
more points, and the radii of certain associated circles or spheres.
Self-interaction energies based on these many-body potentials can be used to

for laboratory gamma's of order 1 GeV incident on a target pion at rest. The
pion polarizabilities are determined by their effect on the shape of the

COMPASS a total measurement uncertainty for alpha of order 0.4 for the pion

special Green's function, which serves as a common kernel to all self-energy
and vertex diagrams, and the judicious use of the Slavnov-Taylor identity it
satisfies. In particular, it is shown that the ghost-Green's functions
appearing in this identity capture precisely the result of the pinching action
at arbitrary order. By virtue of this observation the construction of the
quark-gluon vertex becomes particularly compact. It turns out that the
aforementioned ghost-Green's functions play a crucial role, their net effect
being the non-trivial modification of the ghost diagrams of the quark-gluon
vertex in such a way as to reproduce dynamically the characteristic ghost
sector of the background field method. The gluon self-energy is also
constructed following two different procedures. First, an indirect derivation
is given, by resorting to the strong induction method and the assumption of the
uniqueness of the S-matrix. Second, an explicit construction based on the
intrinsic pinch technique is provided, using the Slavnov-Taylor identity
satisfied by the all-order three-gluon vertex nested inside the self-energy
diagrams. The process-independence of the gluon self-energy is also
demonstrated, by using gluons instead of quark as external test particles, and
identifying the corresponding kernel function, together with its Slavnov-Taylor
identity. Finally, the general methodology for carrying out the renormalization
of the resulting Green's functions is outlined, and various open questions are

Wilson loop calculation for 2D NCYM. We compare the LCG results for the WML and
the PV prescription. With WML the loop is well-defined and regular in the
commutative limit. With PV the result is singular. This is intriguing: in the
commutative theory their difference is related to topological excitations,
moreover PV provides a point-like potential. 3) Commutative 2D YM exhibits an
interplay between geometrical and U(N) gauge properties: in the exact
expression of a Wilson loop with n windings a scaling intertwines n and N. In
the NC case the interplay becomes tighter due to the merging of space-time and
``internal'' symmetries. Surprisingly, in our up to O(g^6) (and beyond) crossed

  The characteristic feature of our approach is a quantum version of the Wick
product at coinciding points: the differences of coordinates q_j - q_k are not
set equal to zero, which would violate the commutation relation between their
components. We show that the optimal degree of approximate coincidence can be
defined by the evaluation of a conditional expectation which replaces each
function of q_j - q_k by its expectation value in optimally localized states,
while leaving the mean coordinates (q_1 + ... + q_n)/n invariant.
  The resulting procedure is to a large extent unique, and is invariant under
translations and rotations, but violates Lorentz invariance. Indeed, optimal
localization refers to a specific Lorentz frame, where the electric and
magnetic parts of the commutator of the coordinates have to coincide *).
  Employing an adiabatic switching, we show that the S-matrix is term by term
finite. The matrix elements of the transfer matrix are determined, at each
order in the perturbative expansion, by kernels with Gaussian decay in the
Planck scale. The adiabatic limit and the large scale limit of this theory will
be studied elsewhere.

compact linear group $G$ acting in an euclidean space $\real^n$, can profitably
be studied as functions defined in the orbit space of the group. The orbit
space is the union of a finite set of strata, which are semialgebraic manifolds
formed by the $G$-orbits with the same orbit-type. In this paper we provide a
simple recipe to obtain rational parametrizations of the strata. Our results
can be easily exploited, in many physical contexts where the study of
equivariant or invariant functions is important, for instance in the
determination of patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking, in the analysis of
phase spaces and structural phase transitions (Landau theory), in equivariant
bifurcation theory, in crystal field theory and in most areas where use is made
of symmetry adapted functions.
  A physically significant example of utilization of the recipe is given,
related to spontaneous polarization in chiral biaxial liquid crystals, where
the advantages with respect to previous heuristic approaches are shown.

from a finite set of randomly scattered data $f(x_j)$. A common and powerful
approach is to construct a trigonometric least squares approximation based on
the set of exponentials $\{e^{2\pi i kx}\}$. This leads to fast numerical
algorithms, but suffers from disturbing boundary effects due to the underlying
periodicity assumption on the data, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
practice. To overcome this drawback we impose Neumann boundary conditions on
the data. This implies the use of cosine polynomials $\cos (\pi kx)$ as basis
functions. We show that scattered data approximation using cosine polynomials
leads to a least squares problem involving certain Toeplitz+Hankel matrices. We
derive estimates on the condition number of these matrices. Unlike other
Toeplitz+Hankel matrices, the Toeplitz+Hankel matrices arising in our context
cannot be diagonalized by the discrete cosine transform, but they still allow a
fast matrix-vector multiplication via DCT which gives rise to fast conjugate
gradient type algorithms. We show how the results can be generalized to higher
dimensions. Finally we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method by
applying it to a two-dimensional geophysical scattered data problem.

formulate this as a question about fatpoints in P^{n-1}. In the three variable
case this is equivalent to studying the dimension of a linear system on a blow
up of P^2. The ideals that arise have the points in very special position, but
because there are only seven points, we can apply results of Harbourne to
obtain the classes of the negative curves. Reducing to an effective, nef
divisor and using Riemann-Roch yields a formula for the Hilbert series. This
proves the n=3 case of a conjecture of Postnikov and Shapiro, which they later
showed true for all n. Postnikov and Shapiro observe that for a family of
ideals closely related to J_\phi a similar result often seems to hold, although
counterexamples exist for n=4 and n=5. Our methods allow us to prove that for
n=3 an analogous formula is indeed true. We close with a counterexample to a

of noise. We focus on the spectral properties of the noisy evolution operator,
and prove that for any amount of noise, the quantum spectrum converges to the
classical one in the semiclassical limit. The small-noise behaviour of the
classical spectrum highly depends on the dynamics generated by the map. For a
chaotic dynamics, the outer spectrum consists in isolated eigenvalues
(``resonances'') inside the unit circle, leading to an exponential damping of
correlations. On the opposite, in the case of a regular map, part of the
spectrum accumulates along a one-dimensional ``string'' connecting the origin
with unity, yielding a diffusive behaviour. We finally study the
non-commutativity between the semiclassical and small-noise limits, and
illustrate this phenomenon by computing (analytically and numerically) the
classical and quantum spectra for some maps.

high-momentum components of the nuclear wave function. The observed scaling
shows that the momentum distributions at high-momenta have the same shape for
all nuclei and differ only by a scale factor. The observed onset of the scaling
at Q$^2>$1.4 and $x_B >$1.5 is consistent with the kinematical expectation that
two nucleon short range correlations (SRC) are dominate the nuclear wave

the infrared behaviour of the gluon and ghost propagators are reviewed. It is
demonstrated that the realization of this confinement criterion (which is
closely related to the Gribov-Zwanziger horizon condition) results from quite
general properties of the ghost Dyson-Schwinger equation. The numerical
solutions for the gluon and ghost propagators obtained from a truncated set of
Dyson--Schwinger equations provide an explicit example for the anticipated
infrared behaviour. The results are in good agreement, also quantitatively,
with corresponding lattice data obtained recently. The resulting running
coupling approaches a fixed point in the infrared, $\alpha(0) = 8.915/N_c$.
Solutions for the coupled system of Dyson--Schwinger equations for the quark,
gluon and ghost propagators are presented. Dynamical generation of quark masses
and thus spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry takes place. In the quenched
approximation the quark propagator functions agree well with those of
corresponding lattice calculations. For a small number of light flavours the
quark, gluon and ghost propagators deviate only slightly from the ones in
quenched approximation. While the positivity violation of the gluon spectral
function is manifest in the gluon propagator, there are no clear indications of
analogous positivity violations for quarks so far.

  From the overall wavelet spectrum two mutually independent skeleton spectra

non-stationary timeseries of the evolution of (a) both stable but also
transient, evolving periodicities, such as the output of low dimensional
dynamical systems and (b) scale-invariant structures, such as discontinuities,
self-similar structures or noise. An indicative application to the
monthly-averaged sunspot index reveals, apart from the well-known 11-year
periodicity, 3 of its harmonics, the 2-year periodicity (quasi-biennial
oscillation, QBO) and several more (some of which detected previously in
various solar, earth-solar connection and climate indices), here proposed being
just harmonics of the QBO, in all supporting the double-cycle solar magnetic
dynamo model (Benevolenskaya, 1998, 2000). The scale maximal spectrum reveals
the presence of 1/f fluctuations with timescales up to 1 year in the sunspot
number, indicating that the solar magnetic configurations involved in the
transient solar activity phenomena with those characteristic timescales are in
a self-organized-critical state (SOC), as previously proposed for the solar
flare occurence (Lu and Hamilton, 1991).

strand of DNA molecule have been calculated. Using these original values of
energies the harmonic behavior of a number of base patterns of DNA has been
studied. In view of the great interest aroused by the discovery of the role of
the telomere segment of the DNA in the replication process and its possible
link with the aging process, we have investigated, with simple models, the
harmonic behavior of the telomeric pattern of bases as well as the
thermodynamic response in the biological system. With these results a
conclusion on the probable role of the telomeric pattern on aging has also been
drawn. Here the calculated values of harmonic frequencies of the telomeric
pattern of bases and of other possible patterns show that the telomeric pattern
is associated with the highest vibrational frequency among all patterns of base
combinations at the replication end of DNA. This seems to suggest that due to
the existing telomeric pattern being closest to the frequencies of the
electromagnetic radiation coming from sunlight, resonance of the telomeric
frequency with such radiation may be responsible for damage to the reproductive
ability of the cells and consequent aging and other problems. On the other hand
in the last part of this work we have calculated the thermal vibrational
amplitudes of the telomeric pattern and other possible patterns which show that
the amplitude for the telomeric pattern is the least, and this suggests that
the telomeric pattern is more mechanically and thermally stable than other
possible patterns in the biological environment against damage from ordinary
heat and mechanical effects.

incident spinless charged particle in a P wave (in a configuration with total
angular momentum zero) we verify a resonance just above threshold using the
Kohn variational principle in its S-matrix form. Even if optimistic choices of

the idealized case the number N of (ideal) mirrors can be indefinitely
increased, yielding an increasingly better QZE. By contrast, in a practical
situation with imperfect mirrors, there is an optimal number of mirrors, N_opt,
at which the QZE becomes maximum: more frequent measurements would deteriorate
the performance. However, a quantitative analysis shows that a good
experimental test of the QZE is still feasible. These conclusions are of
general validity: in a realistic experiment, the presence of losses and
imperfections leads to an optimal frequency N_opt, which is in general finite.
One should not increase N beyond N_opt. A convenient formula for N_opt, valid
in a broad framework, is derived as a function of the parameters characterizing

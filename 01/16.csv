including structure evolution and a realistic galaxy population. We have used a
combination of high-resolution N-body simulations (to describe the dark matter
and diffuse gas component), a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation (to track
the evolution of the sources of ionizing radiation) and the Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code CRASH (to follow the propagation of ionizing photons
into the IGM). The process has been followed in the largest volume ever used
for this kind of study, a field region of the universe with a comoving length
of L~20/h Mpc, embedded in a much larger cosmological simulation. To assess the
effect of environment on the reionization process, the same radiative transfer
simulations have been performed on a 10/h Mpc comoving box, centered on a
clustered region. We find that, to account for the all ionizing radiation,
objects with total masses of M~10^9 Msun must be resolved. In this case, the
simulated stellar population produces a volume averaged ionization fraction
x_v=0.999 by z~8, consistent with observations without requiring any additional
sources of ionization. We also find that environment substantially affects the
reionization process. In fact, although the simulated proto-cluster occupies a
smaller volume and produces a higher number of ionizing photons, it gets
totally ionized later. This is because high density regions, which are more
common in the proto-cluster, are difficult to ionize because of their high
recombination rates.

eclipsing binaries based on the presence of the ellipsoidal light variations.
These variations can be used to detect stellar secondaries with masses ~0.2
M_sun orbiting sun-like stars at a photometric accuracy level which has already
been achieved in transit surveys. By removing candidates exhibiting this effect
it is possible to greatly reduce the number of objects requiring spectroscopic
follow up with large telescopes. Unlike the usual candidate selection method,
which are primarily based on the estimated radius of the orbiting object, this
technique is not biased against bona-fide planets and brown dwarfs with large
radii, because the amplitude of the effect depends on the transiting object's
mass and orbital distance. In many binary systems, where a candidate planetary
transit is actually due to the partial eclipse of two normal stars, the
presence of flux variations due to the gravity darkening effect will show the
true nature of these systems. We show that many of the recent OGLE-III
photometric transit candidates exhibit the presence of significant variations
in their light curves and are likely to be due to stellar secondaries. We find
that the light curves of white dwarf transits will generally not mimic those of
small planets because of significant gravitationally induced flux variations.
We discuss the relative merits of methods used to detect transit candidates
which are due to stellar blends rather than planets. We outline how photometric
observations taken in two bands can be used to detect the presence of stellar
blends.

an Algol-class system, in which the masses of the primary and secondary stars
have evolved via mass transfer to their current values of 11.6 Mo and 4.7 Mo,
respectively. The properties of the primary star are indistinguishable from
those of a ""normal"" star of the same current mass. The secondary is found to be
overluminous for its current mass and exhibits a factor-of-2 enhancement in its
surface He abundance. These results are compatible with ""Case A"" mass exchange
occurring during the core hydrogen burning phase of the current secondary. The
distance derived to the system, 43.2 +/- 1.8 kpc, implies a distance of ~44.3
kpc to the optical center of the LMC. This is several kpc closer than found in
our analyses of other systems and we suggest that HV5936 lies ""above"" the LMC

E(B-V) found for the system - both of which are consistent with expected Milky

  The interactions produce expanding ring structures, offset bars, spokes,and

the central impacts cause larger damage to the bar and the disc than the

the existence of such galaxies. Using a volume limited sample (0.05<z<0.1 and
Mr<-20.5; 25813 galaxies) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, we have found
73 (0.28$\pm$0.03%) passive spiral galaxies and studied their environments. It
is found that passive spiral galaxies live in local galaxy density 1-2
Mpc$^{-2}$ and 1-10 cluster-centric virial radius. Thus the origins of passive
spiral galaxies are likely to be cluster related. These characteristic
environments coincide with the previously reported environment where galaxy
star formation rate suddenly declines and the so-called morphology-density
relation turns. It is likely that the same physical mechanism is responsible
for all of these observational results. The existence of passive spiral
galaxies suggests that a physical mechanism that works calmly is preferred to
dynamical origins such as major merger/interaction since such a mechanism can
destroy spiral arm structures. Compared with observed cluster galaxy evolution
such as the Butcher-Oemler effect and the morphological Butcher-Oemler effect,
passive spiral galaxies are likely to be a galaxy population in transition

galaxies more numerous in higher redshift clusters.

strength of their Hdelta absorption line. These galaxies are commonly known as
``post-starburst'' or ``E+A'' galaxies, and the study of these galaxies has
been severely hampered by the lack of a large, statistical sample of such
galaxies. In this paper, we rectify this problem by selecting a sample of
galaxies which possess an absorption Hdelta equivalent width of EW(Hdelta_max)
- Delta EW(Hdelta_max) > 4A from 106682 galaxies in the SDSS. We have performed
extensive tests on our catalog including comparing different methodologies of
measuring the Hdelta absorption and studying the effects of stellar absorption,
dust extinction, emission-filling and measurement error. The measured abundance
of our Hdelta-selected (HDS) galaxies is 2.6 +/- 0.1% of all galaxies within a
volume-limited sample of 0.05<z<0.1 and M(r*)<-20.5, which is consistent with
previous studies of such galaxies in the literature. We find that only 25 of
our HDS galaxies in this volume-limited sample (3.5+/-0.7%) show no evidence
for OII and Halpha emission, thus indicating that true E+A (or k+a) galaxies
are extremely rare objects at low redshift, i.e., only 0.09+/-0.02% of all
galaxies in this volume-limited sample are true E+A galaxies. In contrast,
89+/-5% of our HDS galaxies in the volume-limited sample have significant
detections of the OII and Halpha emission lines. We find 27 galaxies in our
volume-limited HDS sample that possess no detectable OII emission, but do
however possess detectable Halpha emission. These galaxies may be dusty
star-forming galaxies. We provide the community with this new catalog of
Hdelta-selected galaxies to aid in the understanding of these galaxies.

proto-planetary nebula IRAS 22272+5435. Spectroscopy with the Subaru Telescope
adaptive optics system revealed a spatial variation of hydrocarbon molecules
and dust surrounding the star. The ro-vibrational bands of acetylene (C2H2) and
hydrogen cyanide (HCN) at 3.0 um are evident in the central star spectra. The
molecules are concentrated in the compact region near the center. The 3.3 and
3.4 um emission of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons is detected at 600--1300
AU from the central star. The separation of spatial distribution between gas
and dust suggests that the small hydrocarbon molecules are indeed the source of
solid material, and that the gas leftover from the grain formation is being
observed near the central star. The intensity of aliphatic hydrocarbon emission
relative to the aromatic hydrocarbon emission decreases with distance from the
central star. The spectral variation is well matched to that of a laboratory
analog thermally annealed with different temperatures. We suggest that either
the thermal process after the formation of a grain or the variation in the
temperature in the dust-forming region over time determines the chemical
composition of the hydrocarbon dust around the proto-planetary nebula.

  Journal","Astrophys.J.593:788-808,2003","10.1086/376601",,"astro-ph",,"  SN 2001el is the first normal Type Ia supernova to show a strong, intrinsic
polarization signal. In addition, during the epochs prior to maximum light, the
CaII IR triplet absorption is seen distinctly and separately at both normal
photospheric velocities and at very high velocities. The high-velocity triplet
absorption is highly polarized, with a different polarization angle than the
rest of the spectrum. The unique observation allows us to construct a
relatively detailed picture of the layered geometrical structure of the
supernova ejecta: in our interpretation, the ejecta layers near the photosphere
(v \approx 10,000 km/s) obey a near axial symmetry, while a detached,
high-velocity structure (v \approx 18,000-25,000 km/s) with high CaII line
opacity deviates from the photospheric axisymmetry. By partially obscuring the
underlying photosphere, the high-velocity structure causes a more incomplete
cancellation of the polarization of the photospheric light, and so gives rise
to the polarization peak and rotated polarization angle of the high-velocity IR
triplet feature. In an effort to constrain the ejecta geometry, we develop a
technique for calculating 3-D synthetic polarization spectra and use it to
generate polarization profiles for several parameterized configurations. In
particular, we examine the case where the inner ejecta layers are ellipsoidal
and the outer, high-velocity structure is one of four possibilities: a
spherical shell, an ellipsoidal shell, a clumped shell, or a toroid. The
synthetic spectra rule out the spherical shell model, disfavor a toroid, and
find a best fit with the clumped shell. We show further that different
geometries can be more clearly discriminated if observations are obtained from
several different lines of sight.

megamaser environments, that methanol masing does not scale with OH from
Galactic masers to megamasers. These observations, however, are not sensitive
enough to rule out methanol masing that scales with star formation from
Galactic compact HII regions to starbursts associated with major mergers. This

supernovae have been observed. The abundance patterns are not, however,
consistent with enrichment by supernovae from stars in the range 130-300 Mo. We
accordingly infer that the first-generation supernovae came mostly from
explosions of ~ 20-130Mo stars; some of these produced iron-poor but carbon-

could form because the carbon and oxygen provided pathways for gas to cool.

second phase of the Optical Gravitational Microlensing Experiment (OGLE-II).
The event, sc26_2218, which is very bright (baseline magnitude I=15.10),
appears to exhibit both parallax and finite source effects. The parallax effect
allows us to determine the projected Einstein radius on the observer plane
(approx. 3.8 AU), while the finite source effect allows us to determine the
ratio of the angular source size and the angular Einstein radius. As the
angular size of the star can be estimated using its color and magnitude, we can
hence determine the angular Einstein radius (approx. 0.1 mas). By combining
both the projected and angular Einstein radius we can determine the lens mass M
= 0.050^{+0.016}_{-0.011} solar masses, independent of the source distance. The
lens is therefore a brown dwarf candidate. However, the `parallax' signature is
weak and so we cannot completely discount the possibility that these signatures
originate from binary rotation of the source (which would prevent any estimate
of the lens mass), rather than parallax. However, this can be tested by future
spectroscopic observations. This event highlights the scientific returns for
intense monitoring of bright microlensing events, since the parallax and finite
source effects can be more easily identified due to their high signal-to-noise
ratios.

incident beam of fermions and a fermionic density grating. We find that when
the number of atoms in the beam is comparable to the number of atoms forming
the grating, the dephasing of that grating, which normally leads to a decay of
its amplitude, is suppressed. Instead, the density grating and the beam density
exhibit large nonlinear coupled amplitude oscillations. In this case four-wave
mixing can persist for much longer times compared to the case of negligible
back-action. We also evaluate the efficiency of the four-wave mixing and show
that it can be enhanced by producing an initial density grating with an
amplitude that is less than the maximum value. These results indicate that
efficient four-wave mixing in fermionic alkali gases should be experimentally
observable.

to monitor the flux line dynamics in the PE region. For {$T < 4.5$ K} and $H <

PE region, the relaxation rate was found to be significantly larger in the

large that the magnetization reached a stable (equilibrium) value within

whose horizon is much larger than the AdS radius, different classes of
perturbations are almost exactly {\it isospectral}; this isospectrality is
broken when the black hole's horizon radius is comparable to the AdS radius. We
provide very accurate fitting formulas for the QNM's, which are valid for black
holes of any size and charge $Q<Q_{ext}/3$.
  Electromagnetic and axial perturbations of large black holes are
characterized by the existence of pure-imaginary (purely damped) modes. The
damping of these modes tends to infinity as the black hole charge approaches
the extremal value; if the corresponding mode amplitude does not tend to zero
in the same limit, this implies that {\it extremally charged RN-AdS black holes
are marginally unstable}. This result is relevant in view of the AdS/CFT
conjecture, since, according to it, the AdS QNM's give the timescales for
approach to equilibrium in the corresponding conformal field theory.

behaviour of the gluon and ghost propagators in Landau gauge QCD are reviewed.
The realization of this confinement criterion (which in Landau gauge relates to
Zwanziger's horizon condition) results from quite general properties of the
ghost Dyson-Schwinger equation. The numerical solutions for the gluon and ghost
propagators obtained from a truncated set of Dyson-Schwinger equations provide
an explicit example for the anticipated infrared behaviour. These results are
in good agreement, also quantitatively, with corresponding lattice data
obtained recently. The resulting running coupling approaches a fixed point in
the infrared, $\alpha(0) = 8.9/N_c$. Solutions for the coupled system of
Dyson-Schwinger equations for the quark, gluon and ghost propagators are
presented. Dynamical generation of quark masses and thus spontaneous breaking
of chiral symmetry is found. In the quenched approximation the quark propagator
functions agree well with those of corresponding lattice calculations. For a
small number of light flavours the quark, gluon and ghost propagators deviate
only slightly from the quenched ones. While the positivity violation of the
gluon spectral function is apparent in the gluon propagator, there are no clear
indications of positivity violations in the Landau gauge quark propagator.

along a higher time and the hidden symmetry determines a `twistor group' action

experiments can be understood on the basis of three-wave interactions (resonant
triads). In this paper we consider two-frequency forcing and focus on a
resonant triad that occurs near the bicritical point where two pattern-forming
modes with distinct wavenumbers emerge simultaneously. This triad has been
observed directly (in the form of rhomboids) and has also been implicated in
the formation of quasipatterns and superlattices. We show how the symmetries of
the undamped unforced problem (time translation, time reversal, and Hamiltonian
structure) can be used, when the damping is weak, to obtain general scaling
laws and additional qualitative properties of the normal form coefficients
governing the pattern selection process near onset; such features help to
explain why this particular triad is seen only for certain ""low"" forcing
ratios, and predict the existence of drifting solutions and heteroclinic
cycles. We confirm the anticipated parameter dependence of the coefficients and
investigate its dynamical consequences using coefficients derived numerically
from a quasipotential formulation of the Faraday problem due to Zhang and
Vinals.

non-linearity subjected to an external periodic excitation is studied. The
sequences (cascades) of harmonic and subharmonic stationary solutions to the
equation of motion are obtained by using the harmonic balance approximation
adapted for arbitrary truncation numbers, powers of non-linearity, and orders
of subharmonics. A scheme for investigating the stability of the harmonic
balance stationary solutions of such a general form is developed on the basis
of the Floquet theorem. Besides establishing the stable/unstable nature of a
stationary solution, its stability analysis allows obtaining the regions of
parameters, where symmetry-breaking and period-doubling bifurcations occur.
Thus, for period-doubling cascades, each unstable stationary solution is used
as a base solution for finding a subsequent stationary state in a cascade. The
procedure is repeated until this stationary state becomes stable provided that
a stable solution can finally be achieved. The proposed technique is applied to
calculate the sequences of subharmonic stationary states in driven hardening
Duffing's oscillator. The existence of stable subharmonic motions found is
confirmed by solving the differential equation of motion numerically by means
of a time-difference method, with initial conditions being supplied by the
harmonic balance approximation.

considerations for a macroscopic nucleus show that the surface tension needs to
depend on asymmetry. That dependence modifies the surface energy and implies
the emergence of asymmetry skin. In the mass formula, the volume and surface
and (a)symmetry energies combine as energies of two connected capacitors, with
the volume and surface capacitances proportional to the volume and area,
respectively. The net asymmetry partitions itself into volume and surface
contributions in proportion to the capacitances. A combination of data on skin
sizes and masses constrains the volume symmetry parameter to 27 MeV < alpha <
31 MeV and the volume-to-surface symmetry-parameter ratio to 2.0 < alpha/beta <
2.8. In Thomas-Fermi theory, the surface asymmetry-capacitance stems from a
drop of the symmetry energy per nucleon S with density. We establish limits on
the drop at half of normal density, to 0.57 < S(rho_0/2)/S(rho_0) < 0.83. In
considering the feeding of surface by an asymmetry flux from interior, we

for factorization energies inside of the forbidden bands, the final potential
will have again the initial band structure but it can have bound states
encrusted into the gaps, giving place to localized periodicity defects.

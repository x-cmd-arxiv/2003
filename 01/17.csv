optical variability is dominated by non-thermal cooling of a single emitting

Stokes q and u spectra of individual stars, a few strong maser features tended
to dominate the polarization, with the maser features persisting for less than

Because individual masers are not resolved in our beam-averaged total intensity

characteristic lifetimes of the features rather than attempting to trace the

inhomogeneous conical jet. The conical-jet model can be made to match both the
observed X-ray emission and the VLBI properties of the core with a suitable
choice of Doppler factor, implying the core makes a significant contribution to
the X-ray emission. The parameters of the conical models indicate the jet is
particle dominated at the radii that produce significant emission, and is not
in equipartition. At the inner radius of the conical jet the magnetic field is
of order 0.1 G and the relativistic-particle number density is of order 10
cm^{-3}. When all components are included in the calculation, then on average
the core produces about half of the X-rays, with the other half being split
between the long-lived component C4 and the brightest inner-jet component. We
calculate an average speed and angle to the line-of-sight for the region of the

structure within flat-core triaxial haloes and show that these correlations can
be understood within the framework of a baryonic component modifying the

terminal properties of bulges and their central SBHs are constrained by the
destruction of box orbits in the harmonic cores of dark haloes and the
emergence of progressively less eccentric loop orbits there. SBH masses, M_SBH,
should exhibit a tighter correlation with bulge velocity dispersions, sigma_B,
than with bulge masses, M_B, in accord with observations, if there is a
significant scatter in the M_H-sigma_H relation for the halo. In the context of
this model the observed M_SBH-sigma_B relation implies that haloes should
exhibit a Faber-Jackson type relationship between their masses and velocity

determine the bulge and SBH parameters. The model also has important
implications for galactic morphology and the process of disk formation.

B and Rc bands are in agreement with the results from the comparable CNOC2
survey (Lin et al. 1999), whereas the ESS provides the first estimates of LFs
per spectral type in the Johnson V band. A renewed interpretation of the galaxy
LFs from a redshift survey are obtained by fitting the ESS LFs with composite
functions based on the local LFs per morphological type (Sandage, Binggeli &
Tammann 1985; Jerjen & Tammann 1997). As good or better fits than with pure
Schechter functions are obtained using: for the early-type LF, a two-wing
Gaussian; for the intermediate-type LF, the sum of a Gaussian modeling the
Spiral galaxies and a steep Schechter function (alpha=-1.5) representing the
dwarf elliptical galaxies; for the late-type LF, a similar composite function
with a flat or weaker slope (-0.8<alpha<-0.3) for the Schechter component which
represents the dwarf Irregular galaxies. This analysis illustrates how LFs per

need for a quantitative morphological classification at z>0.1 which separates
the giant and dwarf galaxy populations.

starting to provide interesting or even unique new insights in observational
cosmology. Observed GRB host galaxies have a median magnitude R ~ 25 mag, and
show a range of luminosities, morphologies, and star formation rates, with a
median redshift z ~ 1. They represent a new way of identifying a population of
star-forming galaxies at cosmological redshifts, which is mostly independent of
the traditional selection methods. They seem to be broadly similar to the
normal field galaxy populations at comparable redshifts and magnitudes, and
indicate at most a mild luminosity evolution over the redshift range they
probe. Studies of GRB optical afterglows seen in absorption provide a powerful
new probe of the ISM in dense, central regions of their host galaxies, which is
complementary to the traditional studies using QSO absorption line systems.
Some GRB hosts are heavily obscured, and provide a new way to select a
population of cosmological sub-mm sources. A census of detected optical
tranistents may provide an important new way to constrain the total obscured
fraction of star formation over the history of the universe. Finally, detection
of GRB afterglows at high redshifts (z > 6) may provide a unique way to probe
the primordial star formation, massive IMF, early IGM, and chemical enrichment
at the end of the cosmic reionization era.

observed. There is a break in its afterglow light curve at about 12 minutes
after the bursts, before the break the optical flux decays with a power-law
index of about -1.6, while at late time the power-law slope is about -1
(Chornock et al. 2002). Here we will show that the afterglow light curve of
GRB021211 can be explained within the framework of the standard fireball model.
We show that the afterglow emission before the break time is the contribution
of the emission from both the reverse shock and the forward shock, while the
afterglow emission after the break time is mainly due to the forward shock
emission. From the fitting we can give constraints on the parameters: the
initial Lorentz factor $250\leq \gamma_0 \leq 900$, the surrounding medium
density $n\geq 1.6\times 10^{-3}$ atoms ${\rm cm^{-3}}$, and
$0.077\epsilon_{\rm B}^{3/16} \leq \epsilon_{\rm B}^{1/4}(\frac{\epsilon_{\rm

fractions of the shock energy given to the magnetic field and electrons. We
propose that since the values of $\epsilon_{\rm B}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm e}$ are
somewhat smaller for GRB021211, so the peak energy of the reverse shock
emission is well below the optical band, and thus it is substantially fainter
than 990123 at similar epochs. Also we suggest that such a break might be a
common feature in early optical afterglows.

the premaximum stage and near the outburst maximum, shallow eclipses were
recorded. This finding confirms the previously suggested possibility of the
grazing eclipsing nature of this system. The separate occurrence of the
eclipses and the premaximum halt can be understood as a result of a combination
of two-step ignition of an outburst and the inside-out propagation of the
heating wave. We detected a coherent short-period (0.02549 d) signal on two
subsequent nights around the optical maximum. This signal was likely present
during the maximum phase of the 2000 January outburst. We interpret this signal
as a signature of the intermediate polar (IP) type pulses. The rather strange
outburst properties, strong and hard X-ray emission, and the low luminosity of
the outburst maximum might be understood as consequences of the supposed IP
nature. The ratio between the suggested spin period and the orbital period,
however, is rather unusual for a system having an orbital period of ~0.176 d.

of a longitudinal magnetic field component. To accelerate protons to the
highest observed energies on flare timescales, it is necessary to invoke
anomalous resistivity in the MHD solution. It is shown that the addition of a
longitudinal field component greatly increases the efficiency of ion
acceleration, essentially because it greatly reduces the magnitude of drift
motions away from the vicinity of the X-point, where the accelerating component
of the electric field is largest. Using plasma parameters consistent with flare

most of the satellites have M_B=-16 to -18, comparable to the magnitudes of M32

interlopers, we find that the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of satellites
declines with distance to the primary. For an L* galaxy the r.m.s.
line-of-sight velocity changes from ~120 km/s at 20 kpc to ~60 km/s at 350 kpc.
This decline agrees remarkably well with theoretical expectations, as all
modern cosmological models predict that the density of dark matter in the
peripheral parts of galaxies declines as rho_DM propto r^{-3}. Thus, for the
first time we find direct observational evidence of the density decline
predicted by cosmological models; we also note that this result contradicts
alternative theories of gravity such as MOND. We also find that the velocity
dispersion of satellites within 100 kpc scales with the absolute magnitude of
the central galaxy as sigma propto L^{0.3}; this is very close to the
Tully-Fisher relation for normal spiral galaxies.

on-site (diagonal) disorder that localizes the exciton at chain segments of
size smaller than the full chain length. The exciton diffusion over the
localization segments is considered as incoherent hopping. The diffusion is
probed by the exciton fluorescence quenching which is due to the presence of
point traps in the aggregate. The rate equation for populations of the
localized exciton states is used to describe the exciton diffusion and
trapping. We show that there exist two regimes of the exciton diffusion at low
temperatures. The first, slower one, involves only the states of the very tail
of the density of states, while the second, much faster one, also involves the
higher states that are close to the bottom of the exciton band. The activation

for rapid and reliable folding to a given structure that is stable at
biological temperatures leads to energy landscapes having a single dominant
basin and an overall funnel topography. We show here that, while such a
landscape topography is indeed a sufficient condition for folding, another
possibility also exists, giving a new class of foldable sequences. These
sequences have landscapes that are only weakly funneled in the conventional
thermodynamic sense, but have unusually low kinetic barriers for
reconfigurational motion. Traps have been specifically removed by selection.
Here we examine the possibility of folding on these ""buffed"" landscapes, by
mapping the determination of statistics of pathways for the heterogeneous
nucleation processes involved in escaping from traps to the solution of an
imaginary time Schroedinger equation. This equation is solved analytically in
adiabatic and ``soft-wall'' approximations, and numerical results are shown for
the general case. The fraction of funneled vs. buffed proteins in sequence

bridging to important economical phenomena, such as option pricing, return and

saying that BG statistical mechanics is based on the entropy $S_{BG}=-k \sum_i
p_i \ln p_i$, and typically provides {\it exponential laws} for describing
stationary states and basic time-dependent phenomena, while nonextensive
statistical mechanics is instead based on the entropic form

worldwide range of destruction. Recently, it has been related to the
percolation of worldwide spread passive supporters. This scheme puts the
suppression of the percolation effect as the major strategic issue in the fight
against terrorism. Accordingly the world density of passive supporters should
be reduced below the percolation threshold. In terms of solid policy, it means
to neutralize millions of random passive supporters, which is contrary to
ethics and out of any sound practical scheme. Given this impossibility we
suggest instead a new strategic scheme to act directly on the value of the
terrorism percolation threshold itself without harming the passive supporters.
Accordingly we identify the space hosting the percolation phenomenon to be a
multi-dimensional virtual social space which extends the ground earth surface
to include the various independent terrorist-fighting goals. The associated
percolating cluster is then found to create long-range ground connections to
terrorism activity. We are thus able to modify the percolation threshold pc in
the virtual space to reach p<pc by decreasing the social space dimension,
leaving the density p unchanged. At once that would break down the associated
world terrorism network to a family of unconnected finite size clusters. The
current world terrorism threat would thus shrink immediately and spontaneously
to a local geographic problem. There, military action would become limited and
efficient.

three-dimensional compact manifolds. The cosmological time arrow arises being
connected with the refinement of the canonical partitions, and it is defined by
the action of homomorphisms in the proper inverse spectrum of three-dimensional

postulated having the basic properties of the causal order in the

natural manner a time direction. Moreover, generically they determine a
distinguished space-time point where a singularity in the temperature (a hot

be non-isogenous. (Here $f(x)$ and $h(x)$ are cubic polynomials with
coefficients in a field $K$ of characteristic zero.) Suppose that $f(x)$ and
$h(x)$ are irreducible over $K$, their Galois groups over $K$ coincide with the
full symmetric group $S_3$, and their splitting fields are linearly disjoint
over $K$. Then the elliptic curves $C_f$ and $C_h$ are non-isogenous over an
algebraic closure of $K$.

will be accelerated from z=+h,-h towards z=0 resulting in a situation similar
to two water jets pointed at each other. The ingested plasma convects embedded,
frozen-in toroidal magnetic flux from z=+h,-h to z=0. The counter-directed
flows collide and stagnate at z=0 and in so doing (i) convert their
translational kinetic energy into heat, (ii) increase the plasma density at
z~0, and (iii) increase the embedded toroidal flux density at z~0. The increase
in toroidal flux density at z~0 increases the toroidal field Bphi and hence
increases the magnetic pinch force at z~0 and so causes a reduction of the flux
tube radius at z~0. Thus, the flux tube develops an axially uniform
cross-section, a decreased volume, an increased density, and an increased
temperature. This model is proposed as a likely hypothesis for the
long-standing mystery of why solar coronal loops are observed to be axially
uniform, hot, and bright.

tomographic technique, which probes the velocity field across the atmosphere of
long-period variable (LPV) stars. The method cross-correlates the optical
spectrum with numerical masks constructed from synthetic spectra and probing
layers of increasing depths. This technique reveals that the line doubling
often observed in LPV stars around maximum light is the signature of the shock
wave propagating in the atmosphere of these pulsating stars. Applications to
the Mira variables RT Cyg and RY Cep are presented, revealing the outward
propagation of the shock.

of Chandra observations of the 17-by-17 arcminute field around Sgr A*. This
field encompasses a physical area of 40 by 40 pc at a distance of 8 kpc. The
completeness limit of the sample at the Galactic center is 10^{31} erg s^{-1}
(2.0--8.0 keV), while the detection limit is an order of magnitude lower. The
281 sources detected below 1.5 keV are mainly in the foreground of the Galactic
center, while comparisons to the Chandra deep fields at high Galactic latitudes
suggest that only about 100 of the observed sources are background AGN. The
surface density of absorbed sources (not detected below 1.5 keV) falls off as
1/theta away from Sgr A*, in agreement with the distribution of stars in
infrared surveys. Point sources brighter than our completeness limit produce
10% of the flux previously attributed to diffuse emission. The log(N)-log(S)
distribution of the Galactic center sources is extremely steep (power-law slope
alpha = 1.7). If this distribution extends down to a flux of 10^{-17} erg
cm^{-1} s^{-1} (10^{29} erg s^{-1} at 8 kpc, 2.0--8.0 keV) with the same slope,
then point sources would account for all of the previously reported diffuse
emission. Therefore, the 2.0--8.0 keV luminosity distribution must flatten
between 10^{29} - 10^{31} erg s^{-1}. Finally, the spectra of more than half of
the Galactic center sources are very hard, and can be described by a power law
($E^{-Gamma}) with photon index Gamma < 1. Such hard spectra have been seen
previously only from magnetically accreting white dwarfs and wind-accreting
neutron stars, suggesting that there are large numbers of these systems in our
field.

correlate with those IRAS colors. The detection rates of SiO masers tend to
increase toward the Galactic center as well as the cases of previous SiO maser
surveys of typical AGB stars. No strong associations of the objects to the
spiral arms were found. The radial-velocity dispersion of the present sample is
comparable with the dispersion of the SiO maser sample of typical AGB stars.
These facts suggest that the present sample of cold IRAS sources with SiO

influence on stellar death, particularly of massive stars. If the angular
momentum of the iron core when it collapses is such as to produce a neutron
star with a period of 5 ms or less, rotation will have important consequences
for the supernova explosion mechanism. Still shorter periods, corresponding to
a neutron star rotating at break up, are required for the progenitors of
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Current stellar models, while providing an excess of
angular momentum to pulsars, still fall short of what is needed to make GRBs.
The possibility of slowing young neutron stars in ordinary supernovae by a
combination of neutrino-powered winds and the propeller mechanism is discussed.
The fall back of slowly moving ejecta during the first day of the supernova may
be critical. GRBs, on the other hand, probably require stellar mergers for
their production and perhaps less efficient mass loss and magnetic torques than
estimated thus far.

whether rotation is important to the explosion mechanism, whether supernovae
are strong sources of gravitational radiation, the star's nucleosynthesis, and
the initial rotation rate of neutron stars and black holes. We find that when

the calculation, one obtains neutron stars spinning at close to critical
rotation at their surface -- or even formally in excess of critical. When
recent estimates of magnetic torques (Spruit 2002) are added, however, the

fainter than the afterglow of GRB 990123 at similar epochs, and fainter than
almost all known afterglows at an epoch of 1d after the GRB. Our near-infrared
and optical observations indicate that this is not due to extinction. Combining
our observations with data reported by other groups, we identify the signature
of a reverse shock. This reverse shock is not detected to a 3-sigma limit of
110 uJy in an 8.46-GHz VLA observation at t=0.10d, implying either that the
Lorentz factor of the burst gamma <~ 200, or that synchrotron self-absorption
effects dominate the radio emission at this time. Our early optical
observations, near the peak of the optical afterglow (forward shock), allow us
to characterize the afterglow in detail. Comparing our model to flux upper
limits from the VLA at later times, t >~ 1 week, we find that the late-time
radio flux is suppressed by a factor of two relative to the >~ 80 uJy peak flux
at optical wavelengths. This suppression is not likely to be due to synchrotron
self-absorption or an early jet break, and we suggest instead that the burst
may have suffered substantial radiative corrections.

He-burning phase, while the breathing pulses are suppressed, in agreement with
the observational constraints coming from the measurements of the R_2 parameter
in a sample of clusters. By taking into account the observational errors on the
individual R-parameter values, as well as uncertainties in the GGC [Fe/H]
scale, treatment of convection and $^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O reaction

$Y_{GGC}$=0.244$\pm$0.006 for the two studied GGC samples. These estimates are
now fully consistent with Y_p obtained from CMB studies. Moreover, the trend of
the individual He-abundances with respect to [Fe/H] is consistent with no
appreciable He-enrichment along the GGC metallicity range.

transition to turbulence. The particles are monodisperse and neutrally-buoyant
with the liquid. The role of the particles on the transition depends both upon
the pipe to particle diameter ratios and the concentration. For large
pipe-to-particle diameter ratios the transition is delayed while it is lowered
for small ratios. A scaling is proposed to collapse the departure from the
critical Reynolds number for pure fluid as a function of concentration into a
single master curve.

means of semiconductor nanostructures. Our quantum hardware consists of
semiconductor macroatoms driven by sequences of ultrafast laser pulses ({\it
all optical control}). Our logical bits are Coulomb-correlated electron-hole
pairs (excitons) in a four-level scheme selectively addressed by laser pulses
with different polarization. A universal set of single and two-qubit gates is
generated by adiabatic change of the Rabi frequencies of the lasers and by
exploiting the dipole coupling between excitons.

cavity field. One of the atoms is exactly at resonance with the field, while
the other is well far from resonance and hence is treated in the dispersive
limit. We find that the presence of the non-resonant atom produces a shift in
the Rabi frequency of the resonant atom, as if it was detuned from the field.
We focus on the discussion of the evolution of the state purity of each atom.

KAM transformations involved in the iterative procedure. The technique is
illustrated on a two-level model perturbed by a pulsed interaction for which we
obtain convergence all the way from the sudden regime to the opposite adiabatic

arbitrary orders (first for large primes). For most quantum algorithms only the
quantum Fourier transform of order $2^n$ is needed, and this can be done
exactly. Kitaev \cite{kitaev} showed how to approximate the Fourier transform
for any order. Here we show how his construction can be made exact by using the
technique known as ``amplitude amplification''. Although unlikely to be of any
practical use, this construction e.g. allows to make Shor's discrete logarithm
quantum algorithm exact. Thus we have the first example of an exact non black
box fast quantum algorithm, thereby giving more evidence that ``quantum'' need
not be probabilistic. We also show that in a certain sense the family of
circuits for the exact QFFT is uniform. Namely the parameters of the gates can
be calculated efficiently.

which may be measured through the electronic energy spectra of C$_{60}$

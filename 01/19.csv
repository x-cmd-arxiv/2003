factor gamma_e equal to the bulk lorentz factor of the blast wave multiplied by
the ratio of proton and electron masses. We suggest that the electron energy

cell containing particles that bind reversibly to it. Using Brownian Molecular
Dynamics simulations we investigate the mean-first-passage time as a function
of the length of the chain inside, for different concentrations of binding
particles. As a consequence of the interactions with these particles, the chain
experiences a net force along its length whose calculated value from the
simulations accounts for the velocity at which it enters the cell. This force
can in turn be obtained from the solution of a generalized diffusion equation
incorporating an effective Langmuir adsorption free energy for the chain plus
binding particles. These results suggest a role of binding particles in the
translocation process which is in general quite different from that of a
Brownian ratchet. Furthermore, non-equilibrium effects contribute significantly
to the dynamics, \emph{e.g.}, the chain often enters the cell faster than
particle binding can be saturated, resulting in a force several times smaller
than the equilibrium value.

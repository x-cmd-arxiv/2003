the formation of subdwarf B (sdB) stars and related objects (sdO, sdOB stars)
using the latest version of the BPS code developed by Han et al.(1994, 1995a,
1995b, 1998, 2001). We systematically investigate the importance of the five
main evolutionary channels in which the sdB stars form after one or two
common-envelope (CE) phases, one or two phases of stable Roche-lobe overflow
(RLOF) or as the result of the merger of two helium white dwarfs (WD) (see Han
et al. 2002, Paper I). Our best BPS model can satisfactorily explain the main
observational characteristics of sdB stars, in particular their distributions
in the orbital period - minimum companion mass diagram and in the effective
temperature - surface gravity diagram, their distributions of orbital period,
log (g theta^4), and mass function, their binary fraction and the fraction of
sdB binaries with WD companions, their birthrates and their space density. We
obtain a Galactic formation rate, a total number in the Galaxy, the intrinsic
binary fraction for sdB stars. We also predict a distribution of masses for sdB
stars that is wider than is commonly assumed and that some sdB stars have
companions of spectral type as early as B. The percentage of A type stars with
sdB companions can in principle be used to constrain some of the important
parameters in the binary evolution model. We conclude that (a) the first RLOF
phase needs to be more stable than is commonly assumed; (b) mass transfer in
the first stable RLOF phase is non-conservative, and the mass lost from the
system takes away a specific angular momentum similar to that of the system;
(c) common-envelope ejection is very efficient.

primarily controlled by the interplay between gravity and magnetostatic
support, modulated by ambipolar diffusion. Recently, however, both
observational and numerical work has begun to suggest that supersonic
interstellar turbulence rather than magnetic fields controls star formation.
Supersonic turbulence can provide support against gravitational collapse on
global scales, while at the same time it produces localized density
enhancements that allow for collapse on small scales. The efficiency and
timescale of stellar birth in Galactic molecular clouds strongly depend on the
properties of the interstellar turbulent velocity field, with slow,
inefficient, isolated star formation being a hallmark of turbulent support, and
fast, efficient, clustered star formation occurring in its absence.

able to separate the spectra of the nucleus, starburst and superwind regions,
while the RXTE data extend the spectrum to higher energies. The extreme
absorbing column of $N_H\sim 4\times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ means that the nucleus
is only seen directly above 8--10 keV, while the lower energy spectrum from the
nuclear region in Chandra is dominated by reflection. By contrast, the
superwind is dominated by emission from hot plasma, but the starburst region
contains both hot plasma and reflection signatures. To form a reflected
spectrum requires that the starburst region contains clumps of cool, optically
thick material, perhaps star forming cores, which are irradiated by 7--10 keV
photons from the nucleus. Since photons of this energy are obscured along the
line sight then this confirms the result of Madejski et al. (2000) that the
extreme absorbtion material is disk-like rather than a torus. However, the
IR/optical limits on the lack of high excitation emission lines show that by
contrast the lower energy photons from the nucleus are obscured in all
directions. We discuss the complex absorption structure revealed by these
observations, and propose an an overall source geometry in which the nucleus is
completely embedded in material with $N_H\sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$

of tens or higher propagating in a moderately dense interstellar medium
(density above $\sim 1000 $ cm$^{-3}$) undergoes a fast dramatic transformation
into a highly radiative state. The process leading to this phenomenon resembles
the first order Fermi acceleration with the difference that the energy is
transported across the shock front by photons rather than protons. The
reflection of the energy flux crossing the shock front in both directions is
due to photon-photon pair production and Compton scattering. Such mechanism
initiates a runaway nonlinear pair cascade fed directly by the kinetic energy
of the shock. Eventually the cascade feeds back the fluid dynamics, converting
the sharp shock front into a smooth velocity gradient and the runaway evolution
changes to a quasi-steady state regime. This effect has been studied
numerically using the nonlinear Large Particle Monte-Carlo code for the
electromagnetic component and a simplified hydrodynamic description of the
fluid. The most interesting application of the effect is the phenomenon of
gamma-ray bursts where it explains a high radiative efficiencyand gives a
perspective to explain spectra of GRBs and their time variability. The results
predict a phenomenon of ``GeV bursts'' which arise if the density of the
external medium is not sufficiently high to provide a large compactness.

investigate the evaporation rate, the flow field and the rate of growth of the

Asymptotic power laws near the vertex (as distance to the vertex goes to zero)

growth near the contact line is found in two time regimes. The deposited mass
falls off as a weak power Gamma of distance close to the vertex and as a
stronger power Beta of distance further from the vertex. The power Gamma
depends only slightly on the opening angle Alpha and stays between roughly -1/3

a bath of elastic hard spheres kept at equilibrium is analyzed by means of the
first Sonine approximation to the (spatially homogeneous) Enskog--Boltzmann
equation. The temperature of the granular fluid relative to the bath
temperature and the kurtosis of the granular distribution function are obtained
as functions of the coefficient of restitution, the mass ratio, and a
dimensionless parameter $\beta$ measuring the cooling rate relative to the
friction constant. Comparison with recent results obtained from an iterative
numerical solution of the Enskog--Boltzmann equation [Biben et al., Physica A
310, 308 (202)] shows an excellent agreement. Several limiting cases are also
considered. In particular, when the granular particles are much heavier than
the bath particles (but have a comparable size and number density), it is shown
that the bath acts as a white noise external driving. In the general case, the
Sonine approximation predicts the lack of a steady state if the control
parameter $\beta$ is larger than a certain critical value $\beta_c$ that
depends on the coefficient of restitution and the mass ratio. However, this
phenomenon appears outside the expected domain of applicability of the
approximation.

dynamical behaviors of two electrons which are confined in a line-shape three
quantum dot molecule driven by an AC electric field. Because the Hamiltonian
contains no spin-flip terms, the six- dimension singlet state and
nine-dimensional triplet state sub-spaces are decoupled and can be discussed
respectively. In particular, the nine-dimensional triplet state sub-spaces can
also be divided into 3 three-dimensional state sub-spaces which are fully
decoupled. The analysis shows that the Hamiltonian in each three-dimensional
triplet state sub-space, as well as the singlet state sub-space for the no
double-occupancy case, has the same form similar to that of the driven two
electrons in two-quantum-dot molecule. Through solving the time-dependent
Sch\""odinger equation, we investigate the dynamical properties in the singlet
state sub-space, and find that the two electrons can maintain their initial
localized state driven by an appropriately ac-field. Particularly, we find that
the electron interaction enhances the dynamical localization effect. The use of
both perturbation analytic and numerical approach to solve the Floquet function
leads to a detail understanding of this effect.

Such an integral defines the kth component of the center of mass for a Cauchy

between H_B and an integral introduced by Beig and O'Murchadha. Although both
H_B and the Beig--O'Murchadha integral are naively divergent, they are in fact
finite modulo the Hamiltonian constraint. Furthermore, we examine the
relationship between H_B and a certain two--surface integral linear in the

detailed interpretation of Odderon in QCD, i.e., in terms of gluons is also
unclear.Taking charm quarks as heavy quarks, we can use NRQCD and take $\eta_c$
as a $c\bar c$ bound state. Hence, in the production of $\eta_c$a free $c\bar
c$ pair is first produced and this pair is transformed into $\eta_c$
subsequently.In the forward region of the kinematics, the $c\bar c$ pair
interacts with initial hadron through exchanges of soft gluons. This
interaction can be studied with HQET, which provides a systematic expansion in
the inverse of the $c$-quark mass $m_c$. We find that the calculation of the

solving a wave function of a $c$-quark propagating in a background field of
soft gluons. At leading order we find that the differential cross-section can
be expressed with four functions, which are defined with a twist-3 operator of
gluons. The effect of exchanging a Odderon can be identified with this operator
in our case. We discuss our results in detail and compare them with those
obtained in previous studies. Our results and those from other studies show
that the differential cross-section is very small in the forward region. We
also show that the production through photon exchange is dominant in the
extremely forward region, hence the effect of Odderon exchange can not be
identified in this region.For completeness we also give results for diffractive

framework of seesaw mechanism. To this end, we consider an explicit seesaw
model, where Dirac and (righthanded) Majorana neutrino masses are
simultaneously measurable, and {\it both} are conjectured to be proportional to
charged-lepton masses. However, the LMA solar solution is {\it also} not
inconsistent with the simple option, where neutrinos are Dirac particles
carrying masses proportional to those of charged leptons.

string theory. This particular setup is based on a model of string mediated
supersymmetry breaking. The inflaton is one of the transverse scalars of a
D4-brane which has one of its spatial dimensions stretched between two
NS5-branes, so that it is effectively three-dimensional. This D4-brane is
attracted to a D6-brane that is separated from the 5-branes by a fixed amount.
The potential of the transverse scalar due to the D4/D6 interaction makes a
good inflaton potential. As the D4-brane slides along the two 5-branes towards
the 6-brane it begins to oscillate near the minimum of the potential. The
inflaton field couples to the massless Standard Model fields through Yukawa
couplings. In the brane picture these couplings are introduced by having
another D6'-brane intersect the D4-brane such that the 4-6' strings, whose
lowest lying modes are the Standard Model matter, couple to the scalar mode of
the 4-4 strings, the inflaton. The inflaton can decay into scalar and spinor
particles on the 4-6' strings, reheating the universe. Observational data is
used to place constraints on the parameters of the model.

evolution of a curve embedded in an (n)-dimensional Riemannian manifold with
constant curvature this leads to a symplectic, a Hamiltonian and an hereditary
operator. This gives us a natural connection between finite dimensional
geometry, infinite dimensional geometry and integrable systems. Moreover one
finds a Lax pair in (\orth{n+1}) with the vector modified Korteweg-De Vries
equation (vmKDV) \[ \vk{t}=
  \vk{xxx}+\fr32 ||\vk{}||^2 \vk{x} \] as integrability condition. We indicate
that other integrable vector evolution equations can be found by using a
different Ansatz on the form of the Lax pair. We obtain these results by using
the {\em natural} or {\em parallel} frame and we show how this can be gauged by
a generalized Hasimoto transformation to the (usual) {\em Fren{\^e}t} frame. If
one chooses the curvature to be zero, as is usual in the context of integrable
systems, then one loses information unless one works in the natural frame.

  experiment was simplified, new arguments in favor and against the main
  hypothesis",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The hypothesis of empty/full waves considers that a click in a detector is
triggered by a property carried by the wave-packet that impinges on that
detector. Different authors call this property particle, but according to the
terminology of this hypothesis, the term full wave is used in this text. The
present article discusses the validity of the empty/full waves hypothesis. It
is shown that the energy conservation principle imposes for a full wave a
continuous trajectory from the source to the detector. That gives legitimacy to
the question -- in case the wave function consists in a couple of
space-separated branches -- which wave-packet was a full wave before the click
in the detector, or, in other authors' terminology, where was the particle
before the detector clicked. This question is a counterfactual question. In
some multi-particle experiments, e.g. Hardy's thought-experiment with an
electron and a positron, the combination of the empty/full waves hypothesis and
counterfactual reasoning leads to a contradiction with the predictions of the
quantum theory. However, it is shown here that this contradiction is solvable
if the locality requirement is relaxed. To the difference from the local hidden
variables, it is not possible to prove or disprove the idea of empty/ full
waves, at least at present. But it is possible to ask whether this hypothesis
offers a solution to the quantum puzzles. The answer is negative. For instance
it offers no solution to the before-before loop. The question remains open
whether the empty/full waves hypothesis is correct, or ""God plays dice"".

the stability region obtained with the flow equations to distill qubits. In
particular, for qutrits we get the phase diagram of the distillation process
with a rich structure of fixed points. We investigate the large-$D$ limit of
qudits protocols and find an analytical solution in the continuum limit. The
general solution of the distillation recursion relations is presented in an
appendix. We stress the notion of weight amplification for distillation
protocols as opposed to the quantum amplitude amplification that appears in the
Grover algorithm. Likewise, we investigate the relations between quantum
distillation and quantum renormalization processes.

the physical processes and have been very powerful in describing quantum
computation and information processing tasks. We introduce the notion of
relative phase change for a quantum system undergoing quantum operation. We
find that the relative phase shift of a system not only depends on the state of
the system, but also depends on the initial state of the ancilla with which it
might have interacted in the past. The relative phase change during a sequence
of quantum operations is shown to be non-additive in nature. This property can
attribute a `memory' to a quantum channel. Also the notion of relative phase
shift helps us to define what we call `in-phase quantum channels'. We will
present the relative phase shift for a qubit undergoing depolarizing channel
and complete randomization and discuss their implications.

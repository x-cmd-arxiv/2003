study the possibility of nucleosynthesis within such baryon-rich outflows by
conducting detailed reaction network calculations in the framework of the basic

relativistic velocities can synthesize appreciable quantities of heavy neutron
capture elements with masses up to the platinum peak and beyond. Small but
interesting amounts of light elements such as deuterium and boron can also be
produced. Depending on the neutron excess and baryon load, the combination of
high entropy, rapid initial expansion and gradual expansion at later times can
cause the reaction flow to reach the fission regime, and its path can be
intermediate between those of the $r$- and $s$-processes (``$n$-process''). The
nucleosynthetic signature of these outflows may be observable in the companion
stars of black hole binary systems and in the most metal-poor stars,
potentially offering an important probe of the inner conditions of the GRB

The mass averaged velocity is shown to be a robust, simple parameter describing
the outflow. The expansion velocity and radius are used to define the dynamical
age; together with the stellar temperature, this gives a measurement of the
luminosity and core mass of the central star. The same technique is applied to
other planetary nebulae with previously measured expansion velocities, giving a
total sample of 73 objects. The objects cluster closely around the Schoenberner
track of 0.61 M_sun, with a very narrow distribution of core masses. The masses
are higher than found for local white dwarfs. The luminosities determined in
this way tend to be higher by a factor of a few than those derived from the
nebular luminosities. The discrepancy is highest for the hottest (most evolved)
stars. We suggest photon leakage as the likely cause. The innermost regions of
the non-[WC] nebulae tend to show strong acceleration. Together with the
acceleration at the ionization front, the velocity field becomes 'U'-shaped.
The presence of strong turbulent motions in [WC] nebulae is confirmed. Except

present STIS spectra of several positions in the Homunculus, showing directly
that eta Car has an aspherical stellar wind. P Cygni absorption in Balmer lines
depends on latitude, with high velocities and strong absorption near the poles.
Stronger absorption at high latitudes is surprising, and it suggests higher
mass flux toward the poles, perhaps resulting from radiative driving with
equatorial gravity darkening on a rotating star. Reflected profiles of He I
lines are more puzzling, offering clues to the wind geometry and ionization
structure. During eta Car's high-excitation state in March 2000, the wind was
fast and dense at the poles, with higher ionization at low latitudes.
  Older STIS data obtained since 1998 reveal that this global stellar-wind
geometry changes during eta Car's 5.5 year cycle, and may suggest that this
star's spectroscopic events are shell ejections. Whether or not a companion
star triggers these outbursts remains ambiguous. The most dramatic changes in
the wind occur at low latitudes, while the dense polar wind remains relatively
undisturbed during an event. The apparent stability of the polar wind also
supports the inferred bipolar geometry. The wind geometry and its variability
have critical implications for understanding the 5.5 year cycle and long-term
variability, but do not provide a clear alternative to the binary hypothesis
for generating eta Car's X-rays.

continuously inject magnetized matter into the computational domain near the

accretion flow to reach a quasi-steady state. We have studied two limiting
cases for the geometry of the injected magnetic field: pure toroidal field and
pure poloidal field. In the case of toroidal field injection, the accreting
matter forms a nearly axisymmetric, geometrically-thick, turbulent accretion
disk. The disk resembles in many respects the convection-dominated accretion
flows found in previous numerical and analytical investigations of viscous
hydrodynamic flows. Models with poloidal field injection evolve through two
distinct phases. In an initial transient phase, the flow forms a relatively
flattened, quasi-Keplerian disk with a hot corona and a bipolar outflow.
However, when the flow later achieves steady state, it changes in character
completely. The magnetized accreting gas becomes two-phase, with most of the
volume being dominated by a strong dipolar magnetic field from which a thermal
low-density wind flows out. Accretion occurs mainly via narrow slowly-rotating
radial streams which `diffuse' through the magnetic field with the help of
magnetic reconnection events.

a qualitatively similar stellar system to the Galaxy. Then we analyze the
chemical and kinematic properties of the bulge stars in our model and find
qualitative agreement with observational data. The early evolution of our model
has revealed that most bulge stars form during the sub-galactic merger (merger
component of the bulge stars). Because of the strong star burst induced by the
merger, the metallicity distribution function of such stars becomes as wide as
observed. We find that another group of the bulge stars forms later in the
inner region of the disk (non-merger component of the bulge stars). Because of
the difference in the formation epoch, the main source of iron for this group
of stars is different from the merger component. Iron in the merger and
non-merger components comes mainly from Type II and Type Ia supernovae,
respectively. Since a Type Ia supernova ejects $\sim$ 10 times more iron than a
Type II supernova, [Fe/H] of the non-merger component tends to be higher than
that of the merger component, which widens the metallicity distribution
function. From these results, we suggest that the Galactic bulge consists of
two chemically different components; one has formed quickly through the
sub-galactic clump merger in the proto-galaxy and the other has formed
gradually in the inner disk.

avail of a sample which includes 33 N measurements or significant limits, a
dozen of O measurements, and only few tentative measurements for C. O is found
to track both S and Si rather closely without signatures of any peculiar
behaviour and the few [O/Zn] ratios available show a mild alpha/iron-peak
enhancement which reinforces earlier evidence. The few tentative C measurements
point to roughly solar [C/Zn] and [C/Si] ratios. N abundances are rather
complex with N/alpha ratios showing a bimodal distribution. The majority of the
values form a first plateau at [N/Si]=-0.82 (+/- 0.13) and about 25 % form a
second plateau at [N/Si]= -1.45 (+/- 0.05). The high values are at the level of
the Blue Compact Dwarfs but they extend further towards lower metallicities.
The lower plateau is a new feature of DLAs with no other counterparts. The two
plateaux are found for different values of the N abundance with the transition
at [N/H] ~ -3.0. We argue that this results from the delayed release of N
between massive and intermediate mass stars with the lower plateau produced by
massive stars (M> 8 M_sun) only, which accounts for the small dispersion. The
systems on the lower plateau are relatively young and imply a continuous
formation of the DLAs. While the interpretation of the N/O in the DLAs needs to
be confirmed, these observations could ultimately prove crucial for the
interpretation of the early N nucleosynthesis.

Using the spectral fitting technique common in X-ray astronomy, we fit black
bodies to nine stellar spectra, ranging from cool flare stars to hot white
dwarfs. The measured temperatures are consistent with literature values at the
expected level of accuracy based on the predicted gain stability of the
instrument. Having also demonstrated that systematic effects due to count rate
are likely to be small, we then proceed to apply the temperature determination
method to four cataclysmic variable (CV) binary systems. In three cases we
measure the temperature of the accretion stream, while in the fourth we measure
the temperature of the white dwarf. The results are discussed in the context of
existing CV results. We conclude by outlining the prospects for future versions

switches into a highly dissipative state (HDS) while the rest remains
superconducting. Then the rest of the meander will progressively switch into
the normal state due to the propagation of this HDS (few m/s) from both ends.
The part L1 has to initially support a power density proportional to r.Jp^2 (r

local excessive dissipation of power and over heating on one part of the wafer

car travel are appropriately scaled, they turn out to have a universal
functional relationship. This corresponds to a canonical-like energy
distribution with exceptions for short trips, which can be theoretically
explained. Altogether, this points to a law of constant average energy
consumption by the physical activity of daily travelling. Applying these

exploited through a novel compositional system that supports runtime

Standard Model quark and lepton fields are localized on the ultraviolet brane,
while the Standard Model gauge fields propagate in the bulk. Supersymmetry is
assumed to be broken on the infrared brane. The relative sizes of supersymmetry
breaking effects are found to depend on the hierarchy between the infrared
scale and the weak scale. If the infrared scale is much larger than the weak
scale the leading supersymmetry breaking effect on the visible brane is given
by gaugino mediation. The gaugino masses at the weak scale are proportional to
the square of the corresponding gauge coupling, while the dominant contribution
to the scalar masses arises from logarithmically enhanced radiative effects
involving the gaugino mass that are cutoff at the infrared scale. While the LSP
is the gravitino, the NLSP which is the stau is stable on collider time scales.
If however the infrared scale is close to the weak scale then the effects of
hard supersymmetry breaking operators on the scalar masses can become
comparable to those from gaugino mediation. These operators alter the relative
strengths of the couplings of gauge bosons and gauginos to matter, and give
loop contributions to the scalar masses that are also cutoff at the infrared
scale. The gaugino masses, while exhibiting a more complicated dependence on
the corresponding gauge coupling, remain hierarchical and become proportional
to the corresponding gauge coupling in the limit of strong supersymmetry
breaking. The scalar masses are finite and a loop factor smaller than the
gaugino masses. The LSP remains the gravitino.

by nearly three orders of magnitude. The basic astrometric observable of the
instrument is the pathlength delay, a measurement made by a combination of
internal metrology measurements that determine the distance the starlight
travels through the two arms of the interferometer and a measurement of the
white light stellar fringe to find the point of equal pathlength. Because this
operation requires a non--negligible integration time to accurately measure the
stellar fringe position, the interferometer baseline vector is not stationary
over this time period, as its absolute length and orientation are
time--varying. This conflicts with the consistency condition necessary for
extracting the astrometric parameters which requires a stationary baseline
vector. This paper addresses how the time-varying baseline is ``regularized''
so that it may act as a single baseline vector for multiple stars, and thereby
establishing the fundamental operation of the instrument.

that the controlled-not is the most robust two-qubit quantum gate, in the sense
that it is the quantum gate which can tolerate the most depolarizing noise and
still generate entanglement. Our results enable us to place several analytic
upper bounds on the value of the threshold for quantum computation, with the
best bound in the most pessimistic error model being 0.5.

Hamiltonians which have tridiagonal matrix representations (Jacobi matrices) in
a discrete basis and an eigenvalue problem is reduced to solving a three term
difference equation. Technique of intertwining operators is applied to creating
new families of exactly solvable Jacobi matrices. It is shown that any thus
obtained Jacobi matrix gives rise to a new exactly solvable non-local potential
of the Schroedinger equation. We also show that the algebraic structure
underlying our approach corresponds to supersymmetry. Supercharge operators
acting in the space $\ell^{2}\times \ell^{2} $ are introduced which together
with a matrix form of the superhamiltonian close the simplest superalgebra.

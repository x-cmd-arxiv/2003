emission from an opaque flat ring of dust with an inner radius 0.14 of the
radius of the Sun and an outer radius approximately equal to the Sun's. This
ring lies within the Roche region of the white dwarf where an asteroid could
have been tidally destroyed, producing a system reminiscent of Saturn's rings.
Accretion onto the white dwarf from this circumstellar dust can explain the
observed calcium abundance in the atmosphere of G29-38. Either as a bombardment
by a series of asteroids or because of one large disruption, the total amount
of matter accreted onto the white dwarf may have been comparable to the total
mass of asteroids in the Solar System, or, equivalently, about 1% of the mass
in the asteroid belt around the main sequence star zeta Lep.

absorption meant younger ages among globular clusters in the Andromeda galaxy
(M31), unless blue stars above the main-sequence turnoff or on the horizontal

detailed mid-ultraviolet (2280-3120A) and optical (3850-4750A) spectra of one
moderately metal-rich M31 globular cluster, G1. We explore the effects of a
wide range of non-solar temperatures and abundance ratios, by combining a small
set of theoretical stellar spectra like those of Peterson et al. (2001) that
were calculated using extensively updated atomic-line constants. To match the
mid-UV fluxes of G1, we find that hot components with Teff >= 8000K must be
included. We obtain a very good fit with cool and hot blue horizontal branch
(BHB) stars, but less satisfactory fits for blue straggler stars, those hotter
than the main-sequence turnoff.
  The G1 color-magnitude diagram does show cool BHB stars, and the color of its
giant branch supports the metallicity of one-sixth the solar value that we
deduce. The turnoff temperature of the best-fit model is consistent with that
of turnoff stars in galactic globular clusters and the field halo, indicating
G1 is comparably old. Because metal-rich cool BHB and extremely blue HB stars
have now been found within our own Galaxy, we suggest that these hot
horizontal-branch stars be considered in fitting spectra of metal-rich
populations such as the Andromeda globular clusters, to avoid possible
underestimates of their ages. We plan to make the relevant spectral
calculations available as part of our Hubble Treasury Program.

3'' or 270 pc from the nucleus), two offset ridges of CO emission emanating
from the CO peaks, and a CO ring (with a radius of ~ 14'' or 1.3 kpc).
Double-peaked velocity profiles are also evident near the two CO peaks,
implying that these CO peaks are orbit crowding zones in a barred/oval
potential. Although NIR data only give an upper limit of the possible bar
lengths, due to a large inclination of the NGC 5033 disk (i = 68 deg), our CO

12'' - 15'' or 1.1 - 1.4 kpc) nuclear bar (or oval structure) in the center of

high-resolution CO imaging-spectroscopy is useful to search for nuclear bars,

applicable. We find that the gas mass-to-dynamical mass ratio, M_gas/M_dyn, is
small (< 1%) within a radius of 2'' or 180 pc, in contrast to starburst nuclei.

accretion disk cooling by neutrino emission and photo-disintegration of bound
nuclei. These cooling processes depend on the angular momentum of the stellar
progenitor via the virial temperature at the Kepler radius where the disk
forms. The production of an observable supernova counterpart to a Gamma-Ray

progenitor. Stars with low angular momentum may produce a GRB without making an
observable supernova. Stars with large angular momentum may make extremely
bright and energetic supernovae like SN 1998bw. Stars with an intermediate

this differential reddening by calculating average $E_{V-I}$ values for stars
in small subregions of the field with respect to a fiducial region, which
significantly improves the appearance of the GC color-magnitude diagrams

much higher redshift ($z\stackrel{>}{_{\sim}}1.5$) objects. Nevertheless, the
handful of $z\sim0.5$ sources which we identify are likely to be the low-$z$

structured features are well explained by a combination of crystalline
forsterite, crystalline enstatite, silica and glassy olivine grains.
  Among intermediate-mass young stellar objects (YSOs), crystalline silicates
have already been detected, but no firm detection has been reported so far for
low-mass YSOs such as T Tauri stars. This is the first clear detection of
crystalline silicates in low-mass YSOs and shows that the crystallization event
occurs even in the protoplanetary disk of low-mass YSOs in the T Tauri phase.
The physical processes leading to the inferred dust composition in the
Hen3-600A system may be analogous to those occured in the early epoch of the
Solar system.

source of noise in the detection of extrasolar planets by the transit method.
We derive that most detections of terrestrial planets (1-2 R_Earth) will occur
around G or K stars with 15-16th magnitude. When these stars are 7-12 times
more variable than the Sun on a 10 hour timescale, we demonstrate that the
detection can be performed with a higher S/N provided composite lightcurves
obtained with the combination of two colors are used instead of white ones. The
level of 10 hour variability for K stars is quite uncertain. We make two
""guess-estimates"" of it and find that it could be several times larger than the
solar value. If these estimates were relevant, the color information would not
provide a significant advantage. Although we do not demonstrate a need for
colors, we point out the risk of an unpleasant surprise regarding the 10 hour
stellar variability. Indeed, there is presently no qualified proxy for this
variability. Besides, if Eddington were designed to provide this information at
the cost of added complexity but not sensitivity, white photometry by channel
summation would still be as efficient. Considering the risk that 10 hour
variability is higher than estimated, the Precaution Imperative points to a
study of practical implementations of photometry in different colors before
taking irreversible decisions about the Eddington instrument.

possible that the brightness temperature could be as low as $\sim 10^{13}$ K at

emission from mono-energetic electrons, or an electron spectrum with a
low-energy cut-off such that the critical frequency of the lowest energy
electrons is above the radio frequencies of interest. If one observes optically
thin emission along a long narrow emission region, the average energy density
in the emission region can be many orders of magnitude lower than calculated
from the observed intensity if one assumed a spherical emission region. I
discuss the physical conditions in the emission region and find that the
Compton catastrophe can then be avoided using a reasonable Doppler factor. I

that when MHD turbulence is forced with sufficient kinetic helicity, the

modeled by a recent nonlinear two-scale nonlinear helical dynamo theory in
which the system and forcing scales carry magnetic helicity of opposite sign.
But a two-scale theory cannot model the shift of the small-scale peak toward
the forcing scale. Here I develop a four-scale helical dynamo theory which
shows that the small-scale helical magnetic energy first saturates at very
small scales, but then successively saturates at larger values at larger
scales, eventually becoming dominated by the forcing scale. The transfer of the
small scale peak to the forcing scale is completed by the end of the kinematic
growth regime of the large scale field, and does not depend on magnetic
Reynolds number $R_M$ for large $R_M$. The four-scale and two-scale theories
subsequently evolve almost identically, and both show significant field growth
on the system and forcing scales that is independent of $R_M$. In the present
approach, the helical and nonhelical parts of the spectrum are largely
decoupled. Implications for fractionally helical turbulence are discussed.

parameter of the best fit NFW model is as predicted from numerical simulations
in a LambdaCDM cosmology. Density profiles with very large core-radii are ruled
out. Beyond the virial radius, dynamical equilibrium cannot be taken for

the amplitude of caustics in the space of galaxy clustercentric distances and

consistent with a constant within the virial radius. The mass-to-number density
profile is however inconsistent with a constant when the full radial range from

the objects that dominate the radio luminosity density of the universe at high

redshift of z=1, but the measured redshift distribution has a deficit of
objects with z~2, when compared to predictions based on extrapolating
luminosity functions constrained by higher-flux-density samples. These are the
more luminous objects that usually show emission lines, and which should not be
missed in the survey unless they are heavily reddened. The deficit may be real,
but it would not be too surprising to find a population of faint, reddened
radio sources at z~2-3 among the TOOT sources yet to have accurate redshifts.

objects (YSOs) associated with methanol masers in linear distributions.
Presently, it is a widely held belief that these methanol masers are found in
(and delineate) circumstellar accretion disks around massive stars. If this
scenario is correct, one way to test the disk hypothesis is to search for
outflows perpendicular to the methanol maser distributions. The main objective
of the survey was to obtain wide-field near-infrared images of the sites of
linearly distributed methanol masers using a narrow-band 2.12 micron filter.
This filter is centered on the H2 v=1-0 S(1) line; a shock diagnostic that has
been shown to successfully trace CO outflows from young stellar objects.
Twenty-eight sources in total were imaged of which eighteen sources display H2
emission. Of these, only TWO sources showed emission found to be dominantly
perpendicular to the methanol maser distribution. Surprisingly, the H2 emission
in these fields is not distributed randomly, but instead the majority of
sources are found to have H2 emission dominantly PARALLEL to their distribution
of methanol masers. These results seriously question the hypothesis that
methanol masers exist in circumstellar disks. The possibility that linearly
distributed methanol masers are instead directly associated with outflows is
discussed.

correlations in the half-filled-band case, which contrasts with that for the
paramagnetic case. The mass remains strongly enhanced in the
non-half-filled-band case. We also stress the difference between magnetic and
non-magnetic contributions to the gap. These results are discussed within the
slave boson approach in the saddle-point approximation, in which there appears
a non-linear staggered molecular field due to the electronic correlations that
leads to the appearance of the magnetic gap. They reproduce correctly the
ground-state energy in the limit of strong correlations. A brief comparison

the feasibility of semiconductor--based nanopore devices for ultra--fast DNA
sequencing. The polymer is represented by a simple bead--spring model designed
to yield an appropriate coarse-grained description of the phosphate backbone of
DNA in salt--free aqueous solution. A detailed analysis of single translocation
event is presented to assess whether the passage of individual ions through the
pore can be detected by a nanoscale field--effect transistor by measuring
variations in electrostatic potential during polymer translocation. We find
that it is possible to identify single events corresponding to the passage of
counterions through the pore, but that discrimination of individual ions on the
polymer chain based on variations in electrostatic potential is problematic.
Several distinct stages in the translocation process are identified,
characterized by changes in polymer conformation and by variations in the
magnitude and direction of the internal electric field induced by the
fluctuating charge distribution. The dependence of the condensed fraction of
counterions on Bjerrum length leads to significant changes in polymer
conformation, which profoundly affect the dynamics of electrophoresis and

in the alternating terahertz field of high-intensity far-infrared laser
radiation, with photon energies tens of times lower than the impurity
ionization energy, is reviewed. It is shown that impurity ionization is due to
phonon-assisted tunneling which proceeds at high electric field strengths into
direct tunneling without involving phonons. In the quasi-static regime of low
frequencies the tunneling probability is independent on frequency. Carrier
emission is accomplished by defect tunneling in configuration space and
electron tunneling through the potential well formed by the attractive force of
the impurity and the externally applied electric field. The dependence of the
ionization probability on the electric field strength permits to determine
defect tunneling times, the structure of the adiabatic potentials of the
defect, and the Huang-Rhys parameters of electron-phonon interaction. Raising
the frequency leads to an enhancement of tunneling ionization and the tunneling
probability gets frequency dependent. The transition from the frequency
independent quasi-static limit to frequency dependent tunneling is determined
by the tunneling time which is in the case of phonon asissted tunneling
controlled by the temperature. This transition to the high-frequency limit
represents the boundary between semiclassical physics, where the radiation
field has a classical amplitude, and full quantum mechanics where the radiation
field is quantized and impurity ionization is caused by multi-photon processes.

Ca$_x$La$_{1-x}$VO$_3$, and SrRuO$_3$ indicate that Coulomb correlations are
more pronounced at the surface than in the bulk. To investigate this effect we
use the dynamical mean field theory combined with the Quantum Monte Carlo
technique and evaluate the multi-orbital self-energy. These systems exhibit
different degrees of band filling and range from metallic to insulating. The
key input in the calculations is the layer dependent local density of states
which we obtain from a tight-binding approach for semi-infinite cubic systems.
As a result of the planar character of the perovskite $t_{2g}$ bands near the
Fermi level, the reduced coordination number of surface atoms gives rise to a
significant narrowing of the surface density of those subbands which hybridize
preferentially in planes normal to the surface. Although the total band width
coincides with the one in the bulk, the effective band narrowing at the surface
leads to stronger correlation features in the quasi-particle spectra. In
particular, the weight of the quasi-particle peak near $E_F$ is reduced and the
amplitude of the lower and upper Hubbard bands is enhanced, in agreement with
experiments.

free-energy of an interface of arbitrary orientation between cylinders and
lamellae is found. The interfacial free-energy is anisotropic, and is lower
when the cylinder axis is perpendicular to the interface than when the
cylinders lie along the interface. Consequently, the droplet shape computed via
the Wulff construction is lens-like, being flattened along the axis of the
cylinders. The size of the critical droplet and the nucleation barrier are
determined within classical nucleation theory. Near the lamellar/cylinder phase
boundary, where classical nucleation theory is applicable, critical droplets of
size 30--400 cylinders across with aspect ratios of 4--10 and nucleation
barriers of 30--40 k_B T are typically found. The general trend is to larger

infinite braneworld have been found so far. The problem of finding a static
black hole solution is reduced to a boundary value problem. We solve it by
means of a numerical method, and show numerical examples of a localized black
hole whose horizon radius is small compared to the bulk curvature scale. The
sequence of small localized black holes exhibits a smooth transition from a
five-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, which is a solution in the limit of
small horizon radius. The localized black hole tends to flatten as its horizon
radius increases. However, it becomes difficult to find black hole solutions as
its horizon radius increases.

the well-known multi-Hamiltonian formulation. We work out results for the
Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, which is a member of the positive hierarchy
related to a hereditary operator. Three negative hierarchies of (negative)
evolution equations are defined naturally from the hereditary operator as well,
in the context of field theory. The Euler-Lagrange equations arising from the
action principles are equivalent to the original evolution equation +
deformations, which are obtained in terms of the positive and negative
evolution vectors. We recognize the Liouville, Sinh-Gordon, Hunter-Zheng and
Camassa-Holm equations as negative equations. The ladder for KdV is directly
mappable to a ladder for any of these negative equations and other positive
equations (e.g., the Harry-Dym and a special case of the Krichever-Novikov
equations): a new nonlocal action principle for the deformed system Sinh-Gordon
+ spatial translation vector is presented. Several nonequivalent, nonlocal

Hamiltonian and Symplectic operators are obtained in factorized form.
Alternative Lax pairs for all negative flows are constructed, using the flows

necessary. The specific construction is the transforming of a pair of quantized
free oscillators into a resonant system of coupled oscillators by analytic
continuation which is performed algebraically by the group of complex
symplectic transformations, thereby creating dynamical representations of
numerous semi-groups. The quantum free oscillators are the quantum analogue of
classical action angle variable solutions for the coupled oscillators and
quantum resonances, including Breit-Wigner resonances. Among the exponentially
decaying Breit-Wigner resonances represented by Gamow vectors are hamiltonian
systems in which energy transfers from one oscillator to the other. There are
significant mathematical constraints in order that complex spectra be
accommodated in a well defined formalism which represents dynamics, and these
may be met by using the commutative real algebra $\C (1,i)$ as the ring of
scalars in place of the field of complex numbers. These mathematical
constraints compel use of fundamental (spinor) representations rather than
UIR's. By including distributional solutions to the Schr{\""o}dinger equation,
placing us in a rigged Hilbert space, and by using the Hamiltonian as a
generator of canonical transformation of the space of states, the
Schr{\""o}dinger equation is the equation for parallel transport of generalized
energy eigenvectors, explicitly establishing the Hamiltonian as the generator
of dynamical time translations in this formalism.

representations of the hamiltonian dynamical transformations of systems of

solutions to Schr{\""o}dinger's equation (belonging to a rigged Hilbert space),
and by considering the algebra of observables as a whole, the presence of
Devaney chaos, hyperbolic quasi-invariant measures, complex torus actions,
ergodicity and entropy generation associated to the non-invertible decay of
Gamow vectors and their associated to Breit-Wigner resonances is shown. A weak
(local) form of the second law of thermodynamics is demonstrated through the
decay of resonances. Both correlation formation and decorrelation are
associated with irreversibility and may be associated with entropy growth,
which is due to the dynamical time evolution of resonances. Hilbert space is
the manifold of stationary states. There is a fractal structure associated with
dynamical time evolution of resonances in the space of generalized states, and
the exponential decay of resonances may be identified with quasi-trapping.
Equilibrium states may be regarded as strange attractors with respect to the
dynamical time evolution of resonances.

convergence of the exponential map is possible in available topologies in our

alternative topological completions of the same structure, and physically
represent the stable states of the system. Unitary Clifford algebras can be
used to define dynamical gauge bundles for arbitrary numbers of correlated

the spectrum effectively determined by $S[U(4)\times U(3) \times U(1)]$ due to
the constraint of geodesic transport of the generators of the dynamical group.

motivation has been a series of papers of G. Zappa which appeared in the
1940-50's regarding degenerations of scrolls to unions of planes.
  Here, we present a first set of results on the subject; other aspects are
still work in progress and will appear later.
  We first study the geometry and the combinatorics of a surface like $X$,
considered as a reduced, connected surface on its own; then we focus on the
case in which X is the central fibre of a degeneration of relative dimension
two over the complex unit disk. In this case, we deduce some of the intrinsic
and extrinsic invariants of the general fibre from the ones of its central
fibre.
  In the particular case of $X$ a central fibre of a semistable degeneration,
i.e. $X$ has only global normal crossing singularities and the total space of
the degeneration is smooth, some of the above invariants can be also computed
by topological methods (i.e., the Clemens-Schmid exact sequence). Our results
are more general, not only because the computations are independent on the fact
that $X$ is the central fibre of a degeneration, but also because the

asymmetry results from a cancellation of the various energy terms and cannot be
attributed only to the pseudospin-orbit term, confirming the dynamical

nanoparticles coated with organic ligands. The particles are then spread on a
liquid substrate where they self-assemble to give optical quality reflective
surfaces. Since liquid surfaces can be modified with a variety of means (e.g.
rotation, electromagnetic fields), this opens the possibility of making a new
class of versatile and inexpensive optical elements that can have complex
shapes which can be modified within short time scales. Interferometric
measurements show optical quality surfaces. We have obtained reflectivity
curves that show 80% peak reflectivities.We are confident that we can improve
the reflectivity curves, for theoretical models predict higher values. We
expect that nanoengineered liquid mirrors should be useful for scientific and
engineering applications. The technology is interesting for large optics, such
as large rotating parabolic mirrors, because of its low cost. Furthermore,
because the surfaces of ferrofluids can be shaped with magnetic fields, one can
generate complex, time varying surfaces difficult to make with conventional
techniques.

transmitted and reflected particles in the corresponding subsets of identical

reconstruct, by known out asymptotes (i.e., by the transmitted and reflected
wave packets), the corresponding in asymptotes. Unlike the out asymptotes for
transmission and reflection, their in asymptotes represent nonorthogonal

  combinatorics. ZiF, Bielefeld, Nov. 2002, written version of a talk",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The topics of the paper are: a) Some anti-linear maps governing EPR tasks if
no reference bases are distinguished. b) Imperfect teleportation and the
composition rule. The ancilla is supposed pure but otherwise arbitrary. c)
Quantum telportation with distributed measurements. d) Remarks on EPR with a
mixed state, triggered by a Lueders measurement.

  September, 2002 (edited by T.Elze)",,"10.1007/978-3-540-40968-7_5","Imperial/TP/2-03/9","quant-ph",,"  A brief introduction to the decoherent histories approach to quantum theory
is given, with emphasis on its role in the discussion of the emergence of
classicality from quantum theory. Some applications are discussed, including
quantum-classical couplings, the relationship of the histories approach to
quantum state diffusion, and the application of the histories approach to
situations involving time in a non-trivial way.

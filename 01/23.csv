of secondary cosmic ray (CR) antiprotons appears to be contradictory to
measurements of secondary to primary nuclei ratios in cosmic rays when
calculated in the same Galactic propagation model. The contradiction appears as
a value of the diffusion coefficient necessary to match the secondary ratios
antiproton/proton and B/C. In particlular, it was shown that the reacceleration
models designed to match secondary to primary nuclei ratios produce too few
antiprotons. It is, however, clear that some reacceleration is unavoidable in
the turbulent interstellar medium. Here we discuss an idea of how to improve
reacceleration model by allowing for the damping of interstellar turbulences on
the small scale by cosmic rays, mostly protons. This would lead to increase in
the mean free path lenghts at low energies, the well-known phenomena
empirically discovered in the Leaky Box models, thus producing less secondary
nuclei. Antiprotons will remain almost non-affected due to their high energy
threshold of production cross section.

which the ejecta are collimated and expanding into a constant density medium.
The radio data cannot be fit with an isotropic shock but instead require a jet

source; from this we determine its density and temperature. Radio data reveal a
relativistic component in the plasma, and first measurements of the
intracluster magnetic field have now been made. Energization of the particles
and the field must be related to the cosmological evolution of the cluster. The
situation is made even richer by the few galaxies in each cluster which host
radio jets. In these galaxies, electrodynamics near a massive black hole in the
core of the galaxy lead to a collimated plasma beam which propagates from the
nucleus out to supergalactic scales. These jets interact with the cluster
plasma to form the structures known as radio galaxies. The interaction disturbs
and energizes the cluster plasma. This complicates the story but also helps us
understand both the radio jets and the cluster plasma.

analysis makes clear that study of pulsar timing noise properties in

with the wind code, CMFGEN. The results, in particular iron abundances,
obtained with the two NLTE codes compare very favorably, demonstrating that
basic photospheric parameters of O dwarfs can be reliably determined using NLTE
static model atmospheres. The two NLTE codes require a microturbulent velocity
to match the observed spectra. Our results hint at a decrease of the
microturbulent velocity from early O stars to late O stars. Similarly to
several recent studies of galactic, LMC and SMC stars, we derive effective
temperatures lower than predicted from the widely-used relation between
spectral type and Teff, resulting in lower stellar luminosities and lower
ionizing fluxes. From evolutionary tracks in the HR diagram, we find an age of
3 10^6 years for NGC 346. A majority of the stars in our sample reveal
CNO-cycle processed material at their surface during the MS stage, indicating
thus fast stellar rotation and/or very efficient mixing processes. We obtain an
overall metallicity, Z = 0.2 Zsun, in good agreement with other recent analyses
of SMC stars. The derived mass loss rate of the three most luminous stars
agrees with recent theoretical predictions. However, the three other stars of
our sample reveal very weak wind signatures. We obtain mass loss rates that are
significantly lower than 10^{-8} Msun/yr, which is below the predictions of
radiative line-driven wind theory by an order of magnitude or more. (abridged

remnant nuclei of dwarf elliptical galaxies which have been tidally stripped,

presented, including many of the neutron capture elements. We establish that
HE2148-1247 is a very highly s-process enhanced star with anomalously high Eu
as well, Eu/H about half Solar, demonstrating the large addition of heavy
nuclei at [Fe/H] = -2.3 dex. Ba and La are enhanced by a somewhat larger factor
and reach the solar abundance, while Pb significantly exceeds it. Ba/Eu is ten
times the solar r-process ratio but much less than that of the s-process,
indicating a substantial r-process addition as well. C and N are also very
highly enhanced. We have found that HE2148-1247 is a radial velocity variable.
The C, N and the s-process element enhancements thus presumably were produced
through mass transfer from a former AGB binary companion. The large enhancement
of heavy r-nuclides also requires an additional source as this is far above any
inventory in the ISM at such low [Fe/H]. We further hypothesize that accretion
onto the white dwarf from the envelope of the star caused accretion induced
collapse of the white dwarf, forming a neutron star, which then produced heavy
r-nuclides and again contaminated its companion. (abridged)

nucleosynthesis are still unresolved issues. From consideration of the observed
abundances in metal-poor stars, it is proposed that the production of the heavy
r-process nuclei (with mass numbers A>130) is not related to the production of
the Fe group elements or of the elements with lower atomic numbers: Na, Mg, Al,
Si, Ca, Sc, and Ti. This requires that the production of the heavy r-nuclei not
occur in supernovae with extended shell structure, but be associated with
either bare neutron stars or SNe II in the range of 8-10 solar masses. From the
observations of stars with [Fe/H]=-3 but with high abundances of r-elements, it
is clear that these r-process enrichments cannot represent the composition of
the interstellar medium from which the stars were formed, but must represent
very local contamination from binary companions. Further evidence for very high
enrichments of s-process elements in metal-poor stars also requires binary
systems for explanation. We propose that the accretion-induced collapse (AIC)
of a white dwarf into a neutron star in a binary system may be associated with
the production of the heavy r-nuclei and may provide occasional coupling of
high r-process and high s-process enrichments in the envelopes of low-mass
stars with low [Fe/H]. If we assume that the bulk of the heavy r-nuclei are
produced in AIC events, then these events would have produced about 1.6 billion
neutron stars in the Galaxy.

discuss fundamental properties of MHD turbulence. In particular, we discuss the
generation of compressible MHD waves by Alfvenic turbulence and show that this
process is inefficient. This allows us to study the evolution of different
types of MHD perturbations separately.
  We describe how to separate MHD fluctuations into 3 distinct families -
Alfven, slow, and fast modes. We find that the degree of suppression of slow
and fast modes production by Alfvenic turbulence depends on the strength of the
mean field. We show that Alfven modes in compressible regime exhibit scalings
and anisotropy similar to those in incompressible regime. Slow modes passively
mimic Alfven modes. However, fast modes exhibit isotropy and a scaling similar
to that of acoustic turbulence both in high- and low-beta plasmas. We show that
our findings entail important consequences for theories of star formation,
cosmic ray propagation, dynamics of dust, and gamma ray bursts. We anticipate
many more applications of the new insight to MHD turbulence and expect more
revisions of the existing paradigms of astrophysical processes as the field
matures.

galaxy 3C294 and its cluster environment, increasing by tenfold our earlier
observation. The diffuse emission, extending about 100 kpc around the nucleus,
has a roughly hourglass shape in the N-S direction with surprisingly sharp
edges to the N and S. The spectrum of the diffuse emission is well fitted by
either a thermal model of temperature 3.5 keV and abundance <0.9 solar
(2-sigma), or a power-law with photon index 2.3. If the emission is due to hot
gas then the sharp edges mean that it is probably not in hydrostatic
equilibrium. Much of the emission is plausibly due to inverse Compton
scattering of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by nonthermal electrons
produced earlier by the radio source. The required relativistic electrons would
be of much lower energy and older than those responsible for the present radio
lobes. This could account for the lack of detailed spatial correspondence
between the X-rays and the radio emission, the axis of which is at a position
angle of about 45 deg. Hot gas would still be required to confine the
relativistic plasma; the situation could parallel that of the radio bubbles
seen as holes in nearby clusters, except that in 3C294 the bubbles are bright
in X-rays owing to the extreme power in the source and the sixty fold increase
in the energy density of the CMB. The X-ray spectrum of the radio nucleus is
hard, showing a reflection spectrum and iron line. The source is therefore an
obscured radio-loud quasar.

detached binary. The second common envelope phase occurs shortly after the
secondary becomes a red giant. During the second common envelope phase the
degenerate helium cores merge resulting in a core mass greater than the helium
burning limit and the formation of a horizontal branch star. We show that this

encounters. These encounters increase the population of binary secondaries

the correct degeneracies of the energy level scheme. We applied our formalism
to study the dynamics of H$_{2}$ molecules inside a ""smooth"" carbon nanotube as
a function of tube radius. The results are obtained both by numerical solution
of the ($2J+1$)-component radial Schrodinger equation and by developing an
effective Hamiltonian to describe the splitting of a manifold of states of
fixed angular momentum $J$ and number of phonons, $N$. For nanotube radius
smaller than $\approx 3.5$ \AA, the confining potential has a parabolic shape
and the results can be understood in terms of a simple toy model. For larger
radius, the potential has the ""Mexican hat"" shape and therefore the H$_{2}$
molecule is off-centered, yielding radial and tangential translational dynamics
in addition to rotational dynamics of H$_{2}$ molecule which we also describe
by a simple model. Finally, we make several predictions for the the neutron

probability distribution is given by the two-dimensional equilibrium
distribution of the ice model with domain wall type boundary conditions. This
connection is used to find exact analytic expressions for several quantities of
the stochastic model. Vice versa, some understanding of the ice model with
domain wall type boundary conditions can be obtained by the study of the

self organized criticality. We also find in the stationary state a special
phase transition without enhancement and with a crossover exponent $\phi=2/3$.
Furthermore, we study the phase diagram of the model as a function of the

grain boundary separating two regions of perfectly ordered lamellar structures
under an oscillatory but uniform shear flow. The case considered is a grain
boundary separating lamellae along the so called parallel orientation (with
wavevector parallel to the velocity gradient direction) and along the
transverse orientation (wavevector parallel to the shear direction). In the
model considered lamellae in the parallel orientation are marginal with respect
to the shear, whereas transverse lamellae are uniformly compressed instead. A
multiple scale expansion valid in the weak segregation regime and for low shear
frequencies leads to an envelope equation for the grain boundary. This equation
shows that the grain boundary moves by the action of the shear, with a velocity
that has two contributions. The first contribution, which arises from the
change in orientation of the grain boundary as it is being sheared, describes
variations in monomer density in the boundary region. This contribution is
periodic in time with twice the frequency of the shear and, by itself, leads to
no net motion of the boundary. The second contribution arises from a free
energy increase within the bulk transverse lamellae under shear. It is also
periodic with twice the frequency of the shear, but it does not average to
zero, leading to a net reduction in the extent of the region occupied by the
transverse lamellae. We find in the limit studied that the velocity of the
grain boundary can be expressed as the product of a mobility coefficient times
a driving force, the latter given by the excess energy stored in the transverse
phase being sheared.

length, and the characteristic length of stretched chain segments in the

covalent backbone bonds, and the force distribution develops an exponential
tail at large tensile forces. The failure mode of crazes changes from
disentanglement to scission for $N/N_e\sim 10$, and breakdown through scission

Schwarzschild-de Sitter, we apply the method of complex paths to three
different coordinate systems -- spherically symmetric, Painleve and Lemaitre.
We show that the equilibrium temperature in Schwarzschild-de Sitter is the
harmonic mean of cosmological and event horizon temperatures. We obtain
Bogoliubov coefficients for space-times with multiple horizons by analyzing the
mode functions of the quantum fields near the horizons. We propose a new
definition of entropy for space-times with multiple horizons analogous to the
entropic definition for space-times with a single horizon. We define entropy
for these space-times to be inversely proportional to the square of the
effective surface gravity. We show that this definition of entropy for
Schwarzschild-de Sitter satisfies the D-bound conjecture.

point sources emitting gamma rays of ever-increasing energy. We also calculate
the spectra of all three flavors of neutrinos arising from direct emission from
the fluid at the neutrino-sphere and from the decay of pions and muons from
their decoupling at much larger radii and smaller temperatures for neutrino
energies between 1 GeV and the Planck energy. The results for neutrino spectra
may be applicable for the last few hours and minutes of the lifetime of a
microscopic black hole. In the second part of this thesis the combined field
equations of gravity and a scalar field are studied. When a potential for a
scalar field has two local minima there arise spherical shell-type solutions of
the classical field equations due to gravitational attraction. We establish
such solutions numerically in a space which is asymptotically de Sitter. It
generically arises when the energy scale characterizing the scalar field
potential is much less than the Planck scale. It is shown that the mirror image

representation of the quark propagator. We work at the one-quark-loop level.
Electromagnetic and chiral invariance are ensured with help of the gauge
technique which provides particular solutions to the Ward-Takahashi identities.
General conditions on the quark spectral function follow from natural physical
requirements. In particular, the function is normalized, its all positive
moments must vanish, while the physical observables depend on negative moments
and the so-called log-moments. As a consequence, the model is made finite,
dispersion relations hold, chiral anomalies are preserved, and the twist
expansion is free from logarithmic scaling violations, as requested of a
low-energy model. We study a variety of processes and show that the framework
is very simple and practical. Finally, incorporating the idea of vector-meson
dominance, we present an explicit construction of the quark spectral function
which satisfies all the requirements. The corresponding momentum representation
of the resulting quark propagator exhibits only cuts on the physical axis, with
no poles present anywhere in the complex momentum space. The momentum-dependent

Kaluza-Klein modes with sufficiently large SO(3) quantum numbers. We show that
the spectrum of a pulsating string configuration in S^2 coincides with that of

this precise case, these configurations are unstable --contrary to other

Poincare-like coordinates used for the Maldacena-Nunez background it seems that
it is not possible to reproduce the well-known field theory relation between

polynomials is used for the expansion. The effect of the resummation is to
remove from the PWS the factor containing alpha and beta. The resummed
scattering amplitude is then exactly decomposed into the sum of a nearside (N)
subamplitude and a farside (F) subamplitude. We make two applications of the NF
resummed theory: to elastic angular scattering in a strongly absorptive
collision and to a state-to-state differential cross section for the I + HI >
IH + I reaction. In both applications, we can understand the physical origin of
structure in the angular scattering for suitable choices of alpha, beta and r.

determines the statistical properties of fluctuations of blood flow velocities
in short-time intervals while the Hurst exponent describes the long-term
fractal properties. In many migraineurs the value of the STSE is significantly
reduced and may approach that of the Hurst exponent. This change in dynamical
properties reflects the significant loss of short-term adaptability and the
overall hyperexcitability of the underlying cerebral blood flow control system.

Mg, K, and Ca are proposed. The basis sets are validated by calculating
spectroscopic constants of a variety of diatomic molecules involving these
elements. Neglect of $(3s,3p)$ correlation in K and Ca compounds will lead to
erratic results at best, and chemically nonsensical ones if chalcogens or
halogens are present. The addition of low-exponent $p$ functions to the K and
Ca basis sets is essential for smooth convergence of molecular properties.
Inclusion of inner-shell correlation is important for accurate spectroscopic
constants and binding energies of all the compounds. In basis set
extrapolation/convergence calculations, the explicit inclusion of alkali and
alkaline earth metal subvalence correlation at all steps is essential for K and
Ca, strongly recommended for Na, and optional for Li and Mg, while in Be
compounds, an additive treatment in a separate `core correlation' step is
probably sufficient. Consideration of $(1s)$ inner-shell correlation energy in
first-row elements requires inclusion of $(2s,2p)$ `deep core' correlation
energy in K and Ca for consistency. The latter requires special CCV$n$Z `deep
core correlation' basis sets. For compounds involving Ca bound to
electronegative elements, additional $d$ functions in the basis set are
strongly recommended. For optimal basis set convergence in such cases, we
suggest the sequence CV(D+3d)Z, CV(T+2d)Z, CV(Q+$d$)Z, and CV5Z on calcium.

series, are only valid for random fluctuations that are stationary in time.
Unfortunately, these data are often non stationary and the use of techniques of
analysis resting on the stationary assumption can produce a wrong information
on the scaling, and so on the complexity of the process under study. Herein, we
test and compare two techniques for removing the non-stationary influences from
computer generated time series, consisting of the superposition of a slow
signal and a random fluctuation. The former is based on the method of wavelet
decomposition, and the latter is a proposal of this paper, denoted by us as
step detrending technique. We focus our attention on two cases, when the slow
signal is a periodic function mimicking the influence of seasons, and when it
is an aperiodic signal mimicking the influence of a population change (increase
or decrease). For the purpose of computational simplicity the random
fluctuation is taken to be uncorrelated. However, the detrending techniques
here illustrated work also in the case when the random component is correlated.
This expectation is fully confirmed by the sociological applications made in
the companion paper. We also illustrate a new procedure to assess the existence
of a genuine scaling, based on the adoption of diffusion entropy, multiscaling
analysis and the direct assessment of scaling. Using artificial sequences, we
show that the joint use of all these techniques yield the detection of the real
scaling, and that this is independent of the technique used to detrend the
original signal.

describes quantitatively to what extent all timing information is quantum
information in systems with limited energy. It provides a lower bound on the
dissipated energy when timing information of microscopic systems is converted
to classical information. This is relevant for low power computation since it
shows the amount of heat generated whenever a band limited signal controls a
classical bit switch.
  Our result provides a general bound on the information-disturbance trade-off
for von-Neumann measurements that distinguish states on the orbits of
continuous unitary one-parameter groups with bounded spectrum. In contrast,
information gain without disturbance is possible for some completely positive

entangled Bell-like initial states formed from a model two-state atom and sets
of adjacent photon number states of a single mode radiation field is presented.
The entanglement of the initial states and the subsequent time evolution is
assured by finding a positive lower bound on the concurrence of local 2x2
projections of the full 2xinfinity JCM density matrix. It is found that the
time evolution of the lower bound of the concurrence systematically captures
the corresponding collapse and revival features in atomic inversion, relative
entropies of atomic and radiation, mutual entropy, and quantum deficit. The
atom and radiation subsystems exhibit alternating sets of collapses and
revivals in a complementary fashion due to the initially mixed states of the
atom and radiation employed here. This is in contrast with the result obtained
when the initial state of the dissipationless system is a factored pure state
of atom and radiation, where the atomic and radiation entropies are necessarily
the same. The magnitudes of the entanglement lower bound and the atomic and
radiation revivals become larger as both magnitude and phase of the Bell-like
initial state contribution increases. The time evolution of the entropy
difference of the total system and that of the radiation subsystem exhibits
negative regions called ""supercorrelated"" states which do not appear in the
atomic subsystem. Entangled initial states are found to enhance this
supercorrelated feature. Finally, the effect of phase damping is to randomize
both the subsystems for asymptotically long times .

acquired during the last three years at Observatoire de Haute Provence and
McDonald Observatory as well as other spectra obtained since 1990. The drift of
the line of sight through the foreground cloud due to the large transverse
velocity of HD 34078 allows us to probe the spatial distribution of CH, CH+, CN
and DIBs carriers at scales ranging from about 1 AU up to 150 AU. In
particular, time variations in the equivalent width of absorption lines are
examined. A few past and recent high resolution observations of CH and CH+
absorption are used to search for line profile variations and to convert
equivalent widths into column densities.
  The data set reveals a 20 % increase in CH column density over the past 10
years with no corresponding variation in the column density of CH+ or in the
strengths of the 5780 and 5797 AA DIBs. CN observations indicate that its
excitation temperature has significantly increased from < 3.1 K in 1993 to 3.6
+- 0.17 K in 1998 while the CN column shows only a modest rise of ~ 12 +- 6 %.
The data also strongly suggest the existence of weak correlated variations in
CH and CH+ columns over periods of 6 - 12 months (or ~ 10 AU).
  These results are discussed in relation to CH+ production mechanisms. A dense
newly intervening clump is considered in order to explain the long-term
increase in the column density of CH, but such a scenario does not account for
all observational constraints. Instead, the observations are best described by
CH+ production in a photodissociation region, like that suggested for the
Pleiades and IC 348.

transient RX J170930.2-263927 (XTE J1709-267) returned to quiescence after an
outburst. Using the type I burst peak luminosity found by Cocchi et al. (1998)
and the value of N_H we derived from our spectral fits, the distance to RX
J170930.2-263927 can be constrained to 2.5-10 kpc. RX J170930.2-263927 is
probably associated with the low-metalicity Globular Cluster NGC 6293, which
has a tidal radius of 14.2 arcminutes, since the projected distance to the
centre of the cluster is approximately 25 parsec (9-10 arcminutes). If the
association is correct, RX J170930.2-263927 would be at ~8.5 kpc. We determined
that L_outburst / L_quiescence is approximately 10^5 for this outburst. If the
quiescent luminosity is caused by cooling of the neutron star core then
enhanced core cooling processes were at work implying a neutron star mass of
\~1.7-1.8 Msun. Combining our Chandra observations with archival ROSAT
observations we show that the source most likely exhibits periods of sustained
low-level accretion. Variable, low-level activity could provide an alternative
explanation for some of the sources in the recently proposed category of faint
soft X-ray transients. We found excess emission at ~0.6 keV. If such an excess
is a unique feature of ultracompact systems, as was recently proposed, RX
J170930.2-263927 must have a short orbital period as well. From the constraints
on the distance and the non-detection of the optical counterpart with m_V<20.5,
we conclude that this system must have a low-mass companion.

features, particularly in the radio. While AGN jets are known to emit X-rays,
the situation for XRB jets is not so clear. Radio jets have been resolved in
several XRBs in the low/hard state, establishing that some form of outflow is
routinely present in this state. Interestingly, the flat-to-inverted radio
synchrotron emission associated with these outflows strongly correlates with
the X-ray emission in several sources, suggesting that the jet plasma plays a
role at higher frequencies. In this same state, there is increasing evidence
for a turnover in the IR/optical where the flat-to-inverted spectrum seems to
connect to an optically thin component extending into the X-rays. We discuss
how jet synchrotron emission is likely to contribute to the X-rays, in addition
to inverse Compton up-scattering, providing a natural explanation for these
correlations and the turnover in the IR/optical band. We present model
parameters for fits to several sources, and address some common misconceptions
about the jet model.

and MgI column densities in this object are the largest reported to date for
any BAL outflow. The broad CaII absorption is mildly blended, but the blending
can be disentangled to measure the CaII column density, which is large enough
that the outflow must include a strong hydrogen ionization front. The outflow
begins at a blueshift of ~1650 km/s from the systemic redshift. The lowest
velocity BAL region produces strong CaII absorption but does not produce
significant excited FeII absorption, while the higher velocity excited FeII
absorption region produces very little CaII absorption. We have found that only
a disk wind outflow can explain this segregation. Whether the outflow is smooth
or clumpy, we conclude that the CaII BAL region has a density high enough to
populate excited levels of FeII, but a temperature low enough to prevent them
from being significantly populated. This requirement means the CaII BAL region
has T<1000 K, and perhaps even T<550 K. This quasar also has an associated
absorption line system (AAL) that exhibits partial covering, and therefore is
likely located near the central engine. Its association with the BAL outflow is
unclear. Blending of the AAL with the BAL trough shows that the spatial region
covered by the BAL outflow can vary over velocity differences of ~1700 km/s.

sample of 45 disk galaxies from the U.S. ISO Key Project on Normal Galaxies.
The spectra can be decomposed into three spectral components: (1) continuum
emission from stellar photospheres, which dominates the near-infrared (2.5-
4.9um; NIR) spectral region; (2) a weak NIR excess continuum, which has a color
temperature of ~ 1000K, carries a luminosity of a few percent of the total
far-infrared luminosity L(FIR), and most likely arises from the ISM; and (3)
the well-known broad emission features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6 and 11.3 um, which are
generally attributed to aromatic carbon particles. These aromatic features in
emission (AFEs) dominate the mid-infrared (5.8-11.6 um; MIR) part of the
spectrum, and resemble the so-called Type-A spectra observed in many
non-stellar sources and the diffuse ISM in our own Galaxy. The relative
strengths of the AFEs vary by 15-25% among the galaxies. However, little
correlation is seen between these variations and either IRAS 60um-to-100um flux
density ratio R(60/100) or the FIR-to-blue luminosity ratio L(FIR)/L(B),
suggesting that the observed variations are not a direct consequence of the
radiation field differences among the galaxies. We demonstrate that the NIR
excess continuum and AFE emission are correlated, suggesting that they are
produced by similar mechanisms and similar (or the same) material. On the other
hand, as the current star-formation activity increases, the overall strengths
of the AFEs and the NIR excess continuum drop significantly with respect to
that of the far-infrared emission from large dust grains. This is likely a
consequence of the preferential destruction in intense radiation fields of the
small carriers responsible for the NIR/AFE emission.

Perseus cluster. The global east/west asymmetry of the gas temperature and
surface brightness distributions, approximately aligned with the chain of
bright galaxies, suggests an ongoing merger, although the modest degree of the
observed asymmetry certainly excludes a major merger interpretation. The chain
of galaxies probably traces the filament along which accretion has started some
time ago and is continuing at the present time. A cold and dense (low entropy)
cluster core like Perseus is probably well ""protected"" against the penetration
of the gas of infalling groups and poor clusters whereas in non-cooling core
clusters like Coma and A1367, infalling subclusters can penetrate deeply into
the core region. In Perseus, gas associated with infalling groups may be
stripped completely at the outskirts of the main cluster and only compression
waves (shocks) may reach the central regions. We argue that the passage of such
a wave(s) can qualitatively explain the overall horseshoe shaped appearance of
the gas temperature map (the hot horseshoe surrounds the colder, low entropy
core) as well as other features of the Perseus cluster core. As compression
waves traverse the cluster core, they can induce oscillatory motion of the
cluster gas which can generate multiple sharp ""edges"", on opposite sides or the
central galaxy. Gas motions induced by mergers may be a natural way to explain
the high frequency of ""edges"" seen in clusters with cooling cores.

medium permeated by a uniform magnetic field along which a circularly polarized
Alfven wave propagates. We concentrate on the case of perturbations purely
transverse to the ambient field by means of direct numerical simulations of the
MHD equations and of a linear stability analysis performed on a moderate
amplitude asymptotic model. The Alfven wave provides an extra stabilizing
pressure when the scale of perturbations is sufficiently large or small
compared with the Jeans length $L_J$. However, there is a band of scales around
$L_J$ for which the Alfven wave is found to have a destabilizing effect. In
particular, when the medium is stable in absence of waves, the gravitational
instability can develop when the wave amplitude lies in an appropriate range.
This effect appears to be a consequence of the coupling between Alfven and
magnetosonic waves. The prediction based on a WKB approach that the Alfven wave
pressure tensor is isotropic and thus opposes gravity in all directions is only
recovered for large amplitude waves for which the coupling between the
different MHD modes is negligible.

contributions to the longitudinal proper motions mu_l*(l) that are
indistinguishable from the Oort Constants at the 20% level. Fortunately, we can
correct for this ""mode mixing"" using the latitudinal proper motions mu_b(l). We
use ~10^6 stars from the ACT/Tycho-2 catalogs with proper motion errors of ~ 3
mas/yr. We find significant deviations from expectations based on a smooth
axisymmetric equilibrium disk, in particular non-zero C for old red giant
stars. We also find variations of the Oort constants with the asymmetric drift
of the sub-sample. These correlations are different in nature than those
expected for an axisymmetric Galaxy. The most reliable tracers for the ``true''

high/X-ray off and optical low/X-ray on states of the LMC supersoft X-ray
source RX J0513.9-6951. A sharp ~1 mag drop is common to the CI Aql 2000
outburst. These drops are naturally attributed to cessation of optically thick
winds on white dwarfs. A detailed light-curve analysis of CI Aql indicates that
the size of a disk drastically shrinks when the wind stops. This causes ~1-2
mag drop in the optical light curve. In RX J0513.9-6951, the same mechanism
reproduces sharp ~1 mag drop from optical high to low states. We predict this
mechanism also works on the transition from low to high states. Interaction
between the wind and the companion star attenuates the mass transfer and drives
full cycles of low and high states.

multifrequency observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) where,
because of the width of the point spread functions (PSF), maps at different
frequencies suffer a different loss of spatial resolution. Deblurring is useful
for various reasons: first, it helps to restore high frequency components lost
through the smoothing effect of the instrument's PSF; second, emissions at
various frequencies observed with different resolutions can be better studied
on a comparable resolution; third, some map-based component separation
algorithms require maps with similar level of degradation. Because of
computational efficiency, deblurring is usually done in the frequency domain.
But this approach has some limitations as it requires spatial invariance of the
PSF, stationarity of the noise, and is not flexible in the selection of more
appropriate boundary conditions. Deblurring in real space is more flexible but
usually not used because of its high computational cost. In this paper (the
first in a series on the subject) we present new algorithms that allow the use
of real space deblurring techniques even for very large images. In particular,
we consider the use of Tikhonov deblurring of noisy maps with applications to
{\it PLANCK}. We provide details for efficient implementations of the
algorithms. Their performance is tested on Gaussian and non-Gaussian simulated
CMB maps, and PSFs with both circular and elliptical symmetry. Matlab code is

resulting from the production of pions by ultra-high energy protons scattering
off the cosmic microwave background. Here we show that the GZK feature cannot
be accurately determined with the small sample of events with energies $\sim
10^{20}$ eV detected thus far by the largest two experiments, AGASA and HiRes.
With the help of numerical simulations for the propagation of cosmic rays, we
find the error bars around the GZK feature are dominated by fluctuations which
leave a determination of the GZK feature unattainable at present. In addition,
differing results from AGASA and HiRes suggest the presence of $\sim 30%$
systematic errors that may be due to discrepancies in the relative energy
determination of the two experiments. Correcting for these systematics, the two
experiments are brought into agreement at energies below $\sim 10^{20}$ eV.
After simulating the GZK feature for many realizations and different injection
spectra, we determine the best fit injection spectrum required to explain the
observed spectra at energies above $10^{18.5}$ eV. We show that the discrepancy
between the two experiments at the highest energies has low statistical
significance (at the 2 $\sigma$ level) and that the corrected spectra are best
fit by an injection spectrum with spectral index $\sim 2.6$. Our results
clearly show the need for much larger experiments such as Auger, EUSO, and OWL,
that can increase the number of detected events by 2 orders of magnitude. Only
large statistics experiments can finally prove or disprove the existence of the
GZK feature in the cosmic ray spectrum.

cosmological simulations of structure formation. The galactic evolution is
simulated with a new 3D chemo-dynamical code, including dark matter, stars and
a multi-phase ISM. The simulations start at redshift z=4.85 with a small dark
halo in a LCDM universe and we follow the evolution until the present epoch.
The energy release by massive stars and SNe prevents a rapid collapse of the
baryonic matter and delays the maximum star formation until z=1. The galaxy
forms radially from inside-out and vertically from halo to disk. The first
galactic component that forms is the halo, followed by the bulge, the disk-halo
transition region, and the disk. At z=1, a bar begins to form which later turns
into a triaxial bulge. There is a pronounced deficiency of low-metallicity disk
stars due to pre-enrichment of the disk ISM with metal-rich gas from the bulge
and inner disk (G-dwarf problem). The mean rotation and the distribution of
orbital eccentricities for all stars as a function of metallicity are not very
different from those observed in the solar neighbourhood, showing that
homogeneous collapse models are oversimplified. The approach presented here
provides a detailed description of the formation and evolution of an isolated
disk galaxy in a LCDM universe, yielding new information about the kinematical
and chemical history of the stars and the ISM, but also about the evolution of
the luminosity, the colours and the morphology of disk galaxies.

discrete or purely continuous stimuli, and in the case of multidimensional
continuous angular and discrete correlates, in presence of additional quenched
disorder in the distribution. An analytical expression for the mutual
information has been obtained in the limit of large noise by means of the
replica trick. Here we show that the same results can actually be obtained in
most cases without the use of replicas, by means of a much simpler expansion of
the logarithm. Fitting the theoretical model to real neuronal data, we show
that the introduction of correlations in the quenched disorder improves the
fit, suggesting a possible role of signal correlations-actually detected in
real data- in a redundant code. We show that even in the more difficult
analysis of the asymptotic regime, an explicit expression for the mutual
information can be obtained without resorting to the replica trick despite the
presence of quenched disorder, both with a gaussian and with a more realistic
thresholded-gaussian model. When the stimuli are mixed continuous and discrete,
we find that with both models the information seem to grow logarithmically to
infinity with the number of neurons and with the inverse of the noise, even
though the exact general dependence cannot be derived explicitly for the
thresholded gaussian model. In the large noise limit lower values of
information were obtained with the thresholded-gaussian model, for a fixed

the mass ratio, keeping the mass of the solute fixed. Even in the limit of
large mass ratio the solute motion is found to remain surprisingly coupled to
the solvent dynamics. Interestingly, at intermediate values of the mass ratio,
the self-intermediate scattering function of the solute, F_{s}(k,t) (where k is
the wavenumber and t the time), develops a stretching at long time which could
be fitted to a stretched exponential function with a k-dependent exponent,
\beta. For very large mass ratio, we find the existence of two stretched

both the solute and the solvent particles. It is found that for mass ratio
five, the MCT calculations of the self-diffusion underestimates the simulated
value by about 20 %, which appears to be reasonable because the conventional
form of MCT does not include the hopping mode. However, for larger mass ratio,
MCT appears to breakdown more severely. The breakdown of the MCT for large mass

method can be easily extended to higher dimensions. The kinetic processes
contributing to various terms in the growth equation (GE) are identified from

of physicists, based on simulations, is that in the stationary regime, the
one-dimensional marginal distributions of the fitnesses converges, when $N \to
\infty$, to a uniform distribution on $(f,1)$, for some threshold $f<1$.
  In this paper we consider a discrete version of this model, proposed in
\cite{BK}. In this discrete version, the fitness of a vertex can be either 0 or
1. The system evolves according to the following rules. Each discrete time
step, we choose an arbitrary vertex with fitness 0. If all the vertices have
fitness 1, then we choose an arbitrary vertex with fitness 1. Then we update
the fitnesses of this vertex and of its two neighbours by three new independent
fitnesses, taking value 0 with probability $0<q<1$, and 1 with probability
$p=1-q$. We show that if $q$ is close enough to one, then the mean average
fitness in the stationary regime is bounded away from 1, uniformly in the
number of vertices. This is a small step in the direction of the conjecture
mentioned above, and also settles a conjecture mentioned in \cite{BK}.
  Our proof is based on a reduction to a continuous time particle system.

decomposition of the action, we find an exact expression for the 3-body

degrees of freedom in the system. Non-relativistically these degrees of freedom
can be rewritten in terms of a single particle moving in a two-dimensional
hexagonal well. We find the exact relativistic generalization of this
potential, along with its post-Newtonian approximation. We then specialize to
the equal mass case and numerically solve the equations of motion that follow
from the Hamiltonian. Working in hexagonal-well coordinates, we obtaining
orbits in both the hexagonal and 3-body representations of the system, and plot
the Poincare sections as a function of the relativistic energy parameter $\eta
$. We find two broad categories of periodic and quasi-periodic motions that we
refer to as the annulus and pretzel patterns, as well as a set of chaotic
motions that appear in the region of phase-space between these two types.
Despite the high degree of non-linearity in the relativistic system, we find
that the the global structure of its phase space remains qualitatively the same
as its non-relativisitic counterpart for all values of $\eta $ that we could
study. However the relativistic system has a weaker symmetry and so its
Poincare section develops an asymmetric distortion that increases with
increasing $\eta $. For the post-Newtonian system we find that it experiences a
KAM breakdown for $\eta \simeq 0.26$: above which the near integrable regions

supergravity solutions asymptotic to the maximally supersymmetric IIB plane

branes in flat space. We find that in many cases it is possible to preserve the
extremal horizon of the seed solution. On the other hand, non-extremal
deformations of the plane wave solution result in naked singularities. More
generally, we prove a no-go theorem against the existence of horizons for
backgrounds with a null Killing vector and which contain at most null matter
fields. Further attempts at turning on a nonzero Hawking temperature by
introducing additional matter have proven unsuccessful. This suggests that one
must remove the null Killing vector in order to obtain a horizon. We provide a

Brown-York stress-energy tensor acquires a non trivial contribution from the

opening a window to investigate vacuum polarization effects around a cosmic

dispiration. The use of the propagator is illustrated by computing vacuum
fluctuations. In particular it is shown that the dispiration polarizes the
vacuum giving rise to an energy momentum tensor which, as seen from a local
inertial frame, presents non vanishing off-diagonal components. Such a new
effect resembles that where an induced vacuum current arises around a needle
solenoid carrying a magnetic flux (the Aharonov-Bohm effect), and may have
physical consequences. Connections with a closely related background, namely
the spacetime of a spinning cosmic string, are briefly addressed.

strategies for numerical solution of the quantum billiard problem. The method
is based on the assumption that each eigenstate in a billiard can be
approximated by a superposition of plane waves at a given energy. By the
classical results on the theory of differential operators this can indeed be
justified for billiards in convex domains. On the contrary, in the present work
we demonstrate that eigenstates of non-convex billiards, in general, cannot be
approximated by any solution of the Helmholtz equation regular everywhere in
$\R^2$ (in particular, by linear combinations of a finite number of plane waves
having the same energy). From this we infer that PWDM cannot be applied to
billiards in non-convex domains. Furthermore, it follows from our results that
unlike the properties of integrable billiards, where each eigenstate can be
extended into the billiard exterior as a regular solution of the Helmholtz
equation, the eigenstates of non-convex billiards, in general, do not admit
such an extension.

medium. On the other hand, the ZR predictions suggest that the strong
interaction in the nuclear medium is adequately represented by the free
nucleon-nucleon interaction associated with the impulse approximation. We also
demonstrate that, although the analyzing power is relatively insensitive to the
use different relativistic global optical potential parameter sets, the
prominent oscillatory behavior of this observable is largely attributed to
distortion of the scattering wave functions relative to their plane wave
values.

of Furnstahl, Serot and Tang to the nuclear many-body problem was studied by
applying it to selected doubly-magic, and neighboring single-particle and
single-hole, nuclei far from stability. The success of that approach,
interpreted through density functional theory, would imply reliable densities.
In this paper, the single-particle (Kohn-Sham) wave functions are probed using
weak transitions near the Fermi surface. The weak currents are the Noether
currents derived from the effective Lagrangian. The general single-particle
transition matrix elements, from which any semi-leptonic weak rate can be
calculated, are obtained in terms of upper and lower components of the Dirac
wave functions. Here beta-decays in nuclei neighboring 132-Sn are studied and
compared with available experimental data. Calibration of the theoretical
results for such decays may also have useful application in element formation.

out-perform present-day tungsten alloys is long-rod penetration into a main
battle-tank's armor. However, this advantage is only on the order of 10%, and
it disappears when the comparison is made in terms of actual lethality of
complete anti-tank systems instead of laboratory-type steel penetration
capability. Therefore, new micro- and nano-engineered tungsten alloys may soon
out-perform DU alloys, enabling the production of tungsten munition which will
be better than existing uranium munition, and whose overall life-cycle cost
will be lower, due to the absence of the problems related to the radioactivity
of uranium. The reasons why DU weapons have been introduced and used are
analysed from the perspective that their radioactivity must have played an
important role in the decision making process. It is found that DU weapons
belong to the diffuse category of low-radiological-impact nuclear weapons to
which emerging types of low-yield (i.e., fourth generation) nuclear explosives
also belong. It is concluded that the battlefield use of DU during the 1991
Gulf War, which broke a 46-year-long taboo against the intentional use or
induction of radioactivity in combat, has created a military and legal
precedent which has trivialized the combat use of radioactive materials, and
therefore made the use of nuclear weapons more probable.

second type, the Chebyshev-based approach has been 3--4 times faster than the

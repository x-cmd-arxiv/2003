usually limited by speckles caused by residual phase errors in the optical
system forming the image. The technique of speckle decorrelation involves
introducing many independent realizations of additional phase error into a
wavefront during one speckle lifetime, changing the instantaneous speckle
pattern. A commonly held assumption is that this results in the speckles being
`moved around' at the rate at which the additional phase screens are applied.
The intention of this exercise is to smooth the speckles out into a more
uniform background distribution during their persistence time, thereby enabling
companion detection around bright stars to be photon noise limited rather than
speckle-limited. We demonstrate analytically why this does not occur, and
confirm this result with numerical simulations. We show that the original
speckles must persist, and that the technique of speckle decorrelation merely
adds more noise to the original speckle noise, thereby degrading the dynamic
range of the image.

with a wide range of data at different wavelengths obtained from the

conditions and the physical properties of gas/dust and star formation in the
central regions of galaxies. Our analysis shows that there is a non-linear
relation between CO and FIR luminosities, such that their ratio LCO/LFIR
decreases linearly with increasing LFIR. This behavior was found to be
consistent with the Schmidt Law relating star formation rate to molecular gas
content, with an index N = 1.4 +- 0.3. We also find a possible dependence of
the degree of CO gas excitation on the efficiency of star forming activity.

a mean diameter of about 9 arcmin. The spectrum is fitted with a power-law
model of photon index 2.1 and the east rim is associated with the non-thermal

anisotropic distribution of dust clouds. Assuming single scattering by
spherical grains in a slightly oblate photosphere consistent with the projected

describes an interplay between transient growth and nonlinear saturation of the

is nonlinearity unstable to small but finite initial perturbations. The second
and third are the stochastic mechanisms that account for the interaction of
non-normal effect generated by differential rotation and random additive and

applied to MgB2. We identify two possible scenaria regarding the fate of the
two $\sigma$ subbands under pressure, depending on whether or not both subbands
are above the Fermi energy at ambient pressure. The splitting of the two
subbands is probably caused by the E2g distortion. If only one subband is above
the Fermi energy at ambient pressure (scenario I), application of pressure
diminishes the splitting and it is possible that the lower subband participates
in the superconductivity. The corresponding crossover pressure and Gruneisen

of Mg by Al. In both scenaria, the possibility of electronical topological

violations can be understood by considering separately the contributions from
large wavevectors, which are at quasi-equilibrium and obey FDT, and from small
wavevectors where a generalized FDT holds with a non-trivial limit
fluctuation-dissipation ratio X. In d=1, we get X = 1/2 for spin observables,

sensitive to the domain-wall motion. Numerical simulations in d=2 reveal a

giving conditions that answer the first question, we answer the second question
by focusing on the Lukasiewicz three-axiom system. We then extend our studies

generalize the notion of being double-negation free. The double-negation proofs
of interest rely exclusively on the inference rule condensed detachment, a rule

equations are solved using a high-resolution shock-capturing scheme based on an
approximate Riemann solver. As tests, we performed the following simulations:
(i) long-term evolution of non-rotating and rapidly rotating neutron stars,
(ii) long-term evolution of neutron stars of a high-amplitude damping
oscillation accompanied with shock formation, (iii) collapse of unstable

collapses, and to accurately compute the mass of black holes formed after the

the two components of the complex scalar field are such that the spacetime
geometry remains static, oscillatons give rise to a geometry that is
time-dependent and oscillatory in nature. However, they can still be classified
into stable (S-branch) and unstable (U-branch) cases. We have found that
S-oscillatons are indeed stable configurations under small perturbations and
typically migrate to other S-profiles when perturbed strongly. On the other
hand, U-oscillatons are intrinsically unstable: they migrate to the S-branch if
their mass is decreased and collapse to black holes if their mass is increased
even by a small amount. The S-oscillatons can also be made to collapse to black
holes if enough mass is added to them, but such collapse can be efficiently
prevented by the gravitational cooling mechanism in the case of diluted
oscillatons.

results can be parameterized through the exponent $q$ defining the rate of
contraction of the universe. For $q \geq -1/2$ we find that there are no stable
cases where both variables are regular during the transition. In particular,
for $0<q\ll 1$, we find that the resulting spectral index is close to scale
invariant if $\Psi$ is regular, whereas it has a steep blue behavior if $\zeta$

present thesis, making use of this choice, we first build up a generalisation
of the Polchinski flow equation for the massless scalar field, and, applying it
to the calculation of the beta function at one loop for the characteristic
self-interaction, we test its universality beyond the already known cutoff
independence. Doing so we also develop a method to perform the calculation with
this generalised flow equation for more complex cases. In the second part of
the thesis, the method is extended to SU(N) Yang-Mills gauge theory, regulated
by incorporating it in a spontaneously broken SU(N|N) supergauge group. Making
use of the freedom allowed by scheme independence, we develop a flow equation
for a SU(N|N) gauge theory, which preserves the invariance step by step
throughout the flow and demonstrate the technique with a compact calculation of
the one-loop beta function for the SU(N) Yang-Mills physical sector of SU(N|N),
achieving a manifestly universal result, and without gauge fixing, for the

Schr{\""{o}}dinger equation, in which the modes are coupled by cross phase
modulation (XPM). By means of continuation from various initial patterns taken
in the anti-continuum (AC) limit, we find a number of different solutions of
the DW type, for which different stability scenarios are identified. In the
case of strong XPM coupling, DW configurations contain a single mode at each
end of the chain. The most fundamental solution of this type is found to be
always stable. Another solution, which is generated by a different AC pattern,
demonstrates behavior which is unusual for nonlinear dynamical lattices: it is
unstable for small values of the coupling constant $C$ (which measures the
ratio of the nonlinearity and coupling lengths), and becomes stable at larger
$C$. Stable bound states of DWs are also found. DW configurations generated by
more sophisticated AC patterns are identified as well, but they are either
completely unstable, or are stable only at small values of $C$. In the case of
weak XPM, a natural DW solution is the one which contains a combination of both
polarizations, with the phase difference between them 0 and $\pi $ at the
opposite ends of the lattice. This solution is unstable at all values of $C$,
but the instability is very weak for large $C$, indicating stabilization as the
continuum limit is approached. The stability of DWs is also verified by direct
simulations, and the evolution of unstable DWs is simulated too; in particular,
it is found that, in the weak-XPM system, the instability may give rise to a
moving DW.

collisions at the CERN SPS. The estimates are based on data and models of
proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions. In all of these estimates the
maximum energy density in central Pb+Pb interactions is larger than the
critical energy density of about 0.7 GeV/fm^3 following from lattice gauge
theory computations. In estimates which we consider as realistic the maximum
energy density is about twice the critical value. In this way our analysis
gives some support to claims that deconfined matter has been produced at the
CERN SPS. Any definite statement requires a deeper understanding of formation
times of partons and hadrons in nuclear collisions. We also compare our results
with implicit energy estimates contained in earlier models of anomalous J/psi
suppression in nuclear collisions.

define the problem of the coordinated motion of cilia (the metachronal wave) as
a far from equilibrium process. Rowers are active (two-state) oscillators
interacting solely through forces of hydrodynamic origin. In this work, we
consider the case of fully deterministic dynamics, find analytical solutions of
the equation of motion in the long wavelength (continuum) limit, and
investigate numerically the short wavelength limit. We prove the existence of
metachronal waves below a characteristic wavelength. Such waves are unstable
and become stable only if the sign of the coupling is reversed. We also find
that with normal hydrodynamic interaction the metachronal pattern has the form
of stable trains of traveling wave packets sustained by the onset of
anti-coordinated beating of consecutive rowers.

spikes along neurons is proposed. In the following, velocity of propagation of
small-amplitude pressure waves through the cytoplasmic interior of myelinated
and unmyelinated axons of different diameters is theoretically estimated, and
is found to generally agree with the action potential (AP) conduction
velocities. This remarkable coincidence allows to surmise a model in which AP
spread along axon is propelled not by straggling ionic currents as in the
widely accepted local circuit theory, but by mechanoactivation of the membrane
ion channels by a traveling pressure pulse. Hydraulic pulses propagating in the
viscous axoplasm are calculated to decay over $\sim$ 1 mm distances, and it is
further hypothesized that it is the role of influxing during the AP Ca$^{2+}$
ions to activate the membrane skeletal protein network for a brief radial
contraction amplifying the pressure pulse and preventing its decay. The model
correctly predicts that the AP conduction velocity should vary as the one-half
power of axon diameter for large unmyelinated axons, and as the first power of
the diameter for myelinated axons, provided that specific mechanical properties
of axons are independent from diameter; that myelinization increases the
conduction velocity; that the conduction velocity increases with the
temperature. Unlike the local circuit theory, the model is able to
qualitatively explain observed increase in the AP duration in axons of smaller
diameters. Predictions of...

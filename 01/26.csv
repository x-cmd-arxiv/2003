  Formation, eds. C.L. Curry & M. Fich, NRC press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Recent observational studies of high- and low-mass YSOs at (sub)millimeter
and infrared wavelengths are reviewed, and chemical diagnostics of the
different physical components are summarized. Methods for determining the
temperature, density and abundance profiles in the envelopes are outlined, and
are illustrated for one high-mass and one low-mass YSO. The combination of
(sub)millimeter and infrared data gives a nearly complete chemical inventory of
the gas and solid state material. In both high- and low-mass YSOs, the chemical
characteristics are dominated by freeze-out in the cold outer part of the
envelope and evaporation of ices in the warm inner part. Abundance jumps of
factors of ~100 in selected molecules are found in the warm gas for both types
of objects. Potential differences include (i) the complex hot core chemistry,
which has been observed so far only for high-mass YSOs; (ii) the high level of
deuterium fractionation seen only in low-mass YSOs; (iii) the effects of
internal or external UV and X-rays; (iv) the relative importance of shocks
versus thermal heating of the envelope; and (v) the importance of geometrical
effects.

dwarfs in the temperature range ~20000-110000K, based on far-UV spectroscopy
with STIS/GHRS on HST, IUE and FUSE. Using our latest heavy element blanketed
non-LTE stellar atmosphere calculations we have addressed the heavy element
abundance patterns making completely objective measurements of abundance values
and upper limits using a 2 fitting technique to determine the uncertainties in
the abundance measurements, which can be related to the formal upper limits in
those stars where particular elements are not detected. We find that the
presence or absence of heavy elements in the hot DA white dwarfs largely
reflects what would be expected if radiative levitation is the supporting
mechanism, although the measured abundances do not match the predicted values
very well, as reported by other authors in the past. Almost all stars hotter
than ~50000K contain heavy elements. For most of these the spread in element
abundances is quite narrow and similar to the abundances measured in G191-B2B.
However, there is an unexplained dichotomy at lower temperatures with some
stars having apparently pure H envelopes and others detectable quantities of
heavy elements. The heavy elements present in these cooler stars are often
stratified, lying in the outermost layers of the envelope. A few strong
temperature/evolutionary effects are seen in the abundance measurements. There
is a decreasing Si abundance with temperature, the N abundance pattern splits
into two groups at lower temperature and there is a sharp decline in Fe and Ni
abundance to zero, below ~50000K. When detected, the Fe and Ni abundances
maintain an approximately constant ratio, close to the cosmic value ~20.

binary-binary and binary-single interactions. After a brief period of slight
contraction or expansion of the core over the first few relaxation times, all
clusters enter a much longer phase of stable ""binary burning"" lasting many tens
of relaxation times. The structural parameters of our models during this phase
match well those of most observed globular clusters. At the end of this phase,
clusters that have survived tidal disruption undergo deep core collapse,
followed by gravothermal oscillations. Our results clearly show that the
presence of even a small fraction of binaries in a cluster is sufficient to
support the core against collapse significantly beyond the normal core collapse
time predicted without the presence of binaries. For tidally truncated systems,
collapse is easily delayed sufficiently that the cluster will undergo complete
tidal disruption before core collapse. As a first step toward the eventual goal
of computing all interactions exactly using dynamical three- and four-body
integration, we have incorporated an exact treatment of binary-single
interactions in our code. We show that results using analytical cross sections
are in good agreement with those using exact three-body integration, even for
small binary fractions where binary-single interactions are energetically most
important.

bifurcation before it has a chance to develop cusps. Instead, the global

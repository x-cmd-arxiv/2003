  Accepted for publication ApJ","Astrophys.J.600:520,2004","10.1086/379971",,"astro-ph gr-qc hep-ex hep-ph",,"  We use the strong nebular lines of O III, 5007 A and 4959 A, to set a robust
upper limit on the time dependence of the fine structure constant. We find
|alpha^{-1} d alpha(t)/dt | < 2*10^{-13} yr, corresponding to Delta
alpha/alpha(0) = (0.7 +- 1.4) * 10^{-4} for quasars with 0.16 < z < 0.80
obtained from the SDSS Early Data Release. Using a blind analysis, we show that
the upper limit given here is invariant with respect to 17 different ways of
selecting the sample and analyzing the data. As a by-product, we show that the
ratio of transition probabilities for the 5007 A and the 4959 A lines is2.99 +-
0.02, in good agreement with (but more accurate than) theoretical estimates. We
compare and contrast the O III emission line method used here with the
Many-Multiplet method that has been used recently to suggest evidence for a
time-dependent alpha. In an Appendix, we have analyzed the larger quasar sample
from the SDSS Data Release One Sample and find Delta alpha/alpha(0) = (1.2 +-

i.e. the velocity at which the maximum in the radial gas density profile

modeling of ring galaxy formation however shows that the maximum radial
expansion velocity of gas in the first ring ($v_{gas}$) is invariably below the
propagation velocity of the first gas ring itself ($v_{ring}$). Modeling of the
Cartwheel galaxy indicates that the outer ring is currently propagating at
$v_{ring} \approx$ 100 km/s, while the maximum radial expansion velocity of gas
in the outer ring is currently $v_{gas} \approx$ 65 km/s. Modeling of the
radial B-V/V-K color gradients of the Cartwheel ring galaxy also indicates that
the outer ring is propagating at $v_{ring} \ge $ 90 km/s. We show that a
combined effect of inclination, finite thickness, and warping of the
Cartwheel's disk might be responsible for the lack of angular difference in the
peak positions found for the azimuthally averaged $H\alpha$, K and B surface
brightness profiles of the Cartwheel's outer ring. Indeed, the radial $H\alpha$
surface brightness profiles obtained along the Cartwheel's major axis, where
effects of inclination and finite thickness are minimized, do peak exterior to
those at K- and B-bands. The angular difference in peak positions implies
$v_{ring}$ = 110 km/s, which is in agreement with the model predictions. We
briefly discuss the utility of radio continuum emission and spectral line
equivalent widths for determining the propagation velocity of gas rings in

stars with $M_{V} < -2$ are evolving off the main sequence; stars with $-2 <
M_{V} < +2$ are located on the main sequence and stars with $M_{V} > +2$ are
placed above it. According to our analysis, the cluster distance is $d = 2750
\pm 250 pc$ ($V_{0}-M_{V} = 12.2 \pm 0.2$) and its nuclear age is $8 \pm 1
Myr$. NGC 3293 contains an important fraction of pre--main sequence (PMS) stars
distributed along a parallel band to the ZAMS with masses from 1 to $2.5 \cal
M_{\sun}$ and a mean contraction age of $10 Myr$. This last value does not
differ too much from the nuclear age estimate. Actually, if we take into
account the many factors that may affect the PMS star positions onto the
colour--magnitude diagram, both ages can be perfectly reconciled. The star
formation rate, on the other hand, suggests that NGC 3293 stars formed surely
in one single event, therefore favouring a coeval process of star formation.
Besides, using the $H_{\alpha}$ data, we detected nineteen stars with signs of
having $H_{\alpha}$ emission in the region of NGC 3293, giving another
indication that the star formation process is still active in the region. The
computed initial mass function for the cluster has a slope value $x = 1.2 \pm

values found for other young open clusters.

of the large scale alignment effect in the QSO optical polarization data. The
alignment is found to be much more pronounced in the data sample with low
degrees of polarization $p\le 2$%. This suggests that the alignment may be
attributed to some propagation effect. The distance scale over which the

these species tend to form a central cusp whose presence is not supported by

inside dwarf spirals. The size of the condensate turns out to be precisely
determined by the scalar mass m and self-coupling lambda of the field. We find

for larger systems. The cosmological behavior of the field is also found to be

various forms of baryonic dark matter in galaxies can be conceived,

evaluation of full current statistics (FCS) in multi-terminal mesoscopic

outlined. Then the multi-terminal FCS of the non-interacting electrons is
considered. We show, that this theory appears to be a circuit theory of
$2\times 2$ matrices associated with Keldysh Green functions. Further on the
FCS in the opposite situation of mesoscopic systems placed in a strong Coulomb
blockade limit is discussed. We prove that the theory of FCS in this case turns
out to be an elegant extension of the master equation approach. We illustrate
both methods by applying them to the various three-terminal circuits. We study
the FCS of electron transfer in the three-terminal chaotic quantum dot and
compare it with the statistics of charge transfer in the Coulomb blockade

planar interface with velocity strengthening friction or a shear band in a

different from that of the static interface. In particular, the system being
open, the energy of an in-plane polarized wave is no longer conserved, the work
of the external pulling force being partitioned between frictional dissipation
and gain (of either sign) of coherent acoustic energy. Large values of the
friction coefficient favor energy gain, while velocity strengthening tends to
suppress it. An interface with infinite elastic contrast (one rigid medium) and
V-independent (Coulomb) friction exhibits spontaneous acoustic emission, as
already shown by M. Nosonovsky and G.G. Adams (Int. J. Ing. Sci., {\bf 39},

a moderately large V-strengthening of friction.

give rise to sizeable reflection, which opens a promising possibility for the

patterns of large-scale variation of base composition known as genomic

a maximum likelihood approach to determine the history of substitution patterns

sequence deposited in the human genome over the past ~250 MYR. Using this
approach we estimate the frequencies of seven types of substitutions: the four
transversions, two transitions, and the methyl-assisted transition of cytosine
in CpG. Comparing substitutional patterns in repetitive elements of various
ages, we reconstruct the history of the base-substitutional process in the
different isochores for the past 250 Myr. At around 90 Myr ago (around the time
of the mammalian radiation), we find an abrupt 4- to 8-fold increase of the
cytosine transition rate in CpG pairs compared to that of the reptilian
ancestor. Further analysis of nucleotide substitutions in regions with
different GC-content reveals concurrent changes in the substitutional patterns.
While the substitutional pattern was dependent on the regional GC-content in
such ways that it preserved the regional GC-content before the mammalian
radiation, it lost this dependence afterwards. The substitutional pattern
changed from an isochore-preserving to an isochore-degrading one. We conclude
that isochores have been established before the radiation of the eutherian
mammals and have been subject to the process of homogenization since then.

fitted to results from PYTHIA and scaled in magnitude to the available
experimental data. Charmonium dissociation with nucleons and formed mesons to
open charm ($D+\bar{D}$ pairs) is included dynamically. The 'comover'
dissociation cross sections are described by a simple phase-space model
including a single free parameter, i.e. an interaction strength $M_0^2$, that
is fitted to the $J/\Psi$ suppression data for $Pb+Pb$ collisions at SPS
energies. As a novel feature we implement the backward channels for charmonium
reproduction by $D \bar{D}$ channels employing detailed balance. From our
dynamical calculations we find that the charmonium recreation is comparable to
the dissociation by 'comoving' mesons. This leads to the final result that the
total $J/\Psi$ suppression at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV as a function of centrality
is slightly less than the suppression seen at SPS energies by the NA50
Collaboration, where the 'comover' dissociation is substantial and the backward
channels play no role. Furthermore, even in case that all directly produced
$J/\Psi$ mesons dissociate immediately (or are not formed as a mesonic state),
a sizeable amount of charmonia is found asymptotically due to the $D+\bar{D}
\to J/\Psi$ + meson channels in central collisions of $Au+Au$ at $\sqrt{s}$ =
200 GeV which, however, is lower than the $J/\Psi$ yield expected from binary

of the non-strange and strange mesons at nonzero temperature depend sensitively

mesons significantly affect the properties of the other mesons, nor do their

restoration temperature. In the chiral limit, the transition temperatures for

the two sources are absorbed by column densities higher than 10^24 cm^(-2).
  Combining radio continuum, HI absorption and X-ray data we can constrain the
physical state and the dimensions of the absorber. We find that the putative
obscuring torus is molecular and located at a distance higher than 20 pc from
the center in S5 1946+70. In PKS 1934-63 no radio nucleus has been observed. If
this is due to free-free absorption a radius of only a few pc is inferred.
Since the Kalpha lines have been detected only at 90% confidence, we also
discuss the implications if they would be not as strong as found from our data.
  From our results it appears that the combination of hard X-ray data and
spatially resolved HI absorption measurements provides a powerful diagnostic
for conditions in the absorbing ``torus''.

originate early in the life of the star, but also must be modified (and perhaps

constraints on the rotation of single white dwarf stars come from traditional
spectroscopy and from asteroseismology, with the latter providing hints of
angular velocity with depth. Results of these observational determinations,
that white dwarfs rotate with periods ranging from hours to days (or longer),
tells us that the processes by which angular momentum is deposited and/or
drained from the cores of AGB stars are complex. Still, one can place strong
limits on these processes by considering relatively simple limiting cases for
angular momentum evolution in prior stages, and on subsequent angular momentum
evolution in the white dwarfs. These limiting-case constraints will be reviewed

embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the
current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young
protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first
extensive catalog of galactic embedded cluster properties. We use the catalog
to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters
within roughly 2 Kpc of the Sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate
exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more
indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than
4-7% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become
bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90%) of stars that form in
embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in
excess of 50 solar masses. We review the role of embedded clusters in
investigating the nature of the IMF which, in one nearby example, has been
measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to
subsellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role
embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and
the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of
planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and
dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation

of the star formation efficiency (SFE), and present a first set of numerical
tests of it. A {\it lossy} compressible cascade can generate density
fluctuations and further turbulence at small scales from large-scale motions,
implying that the turbulence in MCs may originate from the compressions that
form them. Below a {\it sonic} scale $\ls$, turbulence cannot induce any
further subfragmentation, nor be a dominant support agent against gravity.
Since progressively smaller density peaks contain progressively smaller
fractions of the mass, we expect the SFE to decrease with decreasing $\ls$, at
least when the cloud is globally supported by turbulence. Our numerical
experiments confirm this prediction. We also find that the collapsed mass
fraction in the simulations always saturates below 100% efficiency. This may be
due to the decreased mean density of the leftover interclump medium, which in
real clouds (not confined to a box) should then be more easily dispersed,
marking the ``death'' of the cloud. We identify two different functional
dependences (``modes'') of the SFE on $\ls$, which roughly correspond to
globally supported and unsupported cases. Globally supported runs with most of
the turbulent energy at the largest scales have similar SFEs to those of
unsupported runs, providing numerical evidence of the dual role of turbulence,
whereby large-scale turbulent modes induce collapse at smaller scales. We
tentatively suggest that these modes may correspond to the clustered and
isolated modes of star formation, although here they are seen to form part of a
continuum rather than being separate modes. Finally, we compare with previous
proposals that the relevant parameter is the energy injection scale.

scenario with an inflation-produced primeval fluctuation spectrum. Special
attention is given to three following problems: (i) The mass spectrum of
small-scale clumps with $M \lesssim 10^3 M_{\odot}$ is calculated with tidal
destruction of the clumps taken into account within the hierarchical model of
clump structure. Only 0.1 - 0.5% of small clumps survive the stage of tidal
destruction in each logarithmic mass interval $\Delta\ln M\sim1$. (ii) The mass
distribution of clumps has a cutoff at $M_{\rm min}$ due to diffusion of DM
particles out of a fluctuation and free streaming at later stage. $M_{\rm min}$
is a model dependent quantity. In the case the neutralino, considered as a pure
bino, is a DM particle, $M_{\rm min} \sim 10^{-8} M_{\odot}$. (iii) The
evolution of density profile in a DM clump does not result in the singularity
because of formation of the core under influence of tidal interaction. The
radius of the core is $R_c \sim 0.1 R$, where $R$ is radius of the clump. The
applications for annihilation of DM particles in the Galactic halo are studied.
The number density of clumps as a function of their mass, radius and distance
to the Galactic center is presented. The enhancement of annihilation signal due
to clumpiness, valid for arbitrary DM particles, is calculated. In spite of
small survival probability, the annihilation signal in most cases is dominated
by clumps. For observationally preferable value of index or primeval
fluctuation spectrum $n_p \approx 1$, the enhancement of annihilation signal is
described by factor 2 - 5 for different density profiles in a clump.

for polarized radio galaxies in clusters. The two most likely origins are,
magnetic fields local to the source, or magnetic fields located in the
foreground intra-cluster medium (ICM). The latter is identified as the null
hypothesis. Rudnick & Blundell (2003) have recently suggested that the presence
of magnetic fields local to the source may be revealed in correlations of the
position angles (PAs) of the source intrinsic linear polarization and the RMs.
We investigate the claim of Rudnick & Blundell to have found a relationship
between the intrinsic PA0 of the radio source PKS 1246-410 and its RM, by
testing the clustering strength of the PA0-RM scatter plot. We show that the
claimed relationship is an artifact of an improperly performed null-experiment.
We describe a gradient alignment statistic aimed at finding correlations
between PA0 and RM maps. This statistic does not require any null-experiment
since it gives a unique (zero) result in the case of uncorrelated maps. We
apply it to a number of extended radio sources in galaxy clusters (PKS
1246-410, Cygnus A, Hydra A, and 3C465). In no case is a significant
large-scale alignment of PA0 and RM maps detected. We find significant
small-scale co-alignment in all cases, but we are able to fully identify this
with map making artifacts through a suitable statistical test. We conclude that
there is presently no existing evidence for Faraday rotation local to radio
lobes. Given the existing independent pieces of evidence, we favor the null
hypothesis that the observed Faraday screens are produced by intracluster
magnetic fields.

class of models. Unlike thermodynamic phase transitions, the dynamic phase
transition is still {\em continuous} despite the presence of hysteresis because
the terms which produce the hysteresis are renormalization group irrelevant. We
discuss the experimental and numerical signatures of one-way hysteresis, which
includes microscopic nucleation.

resolution electron microscopy studies have been performed on YBa2Cu3O7-d thin
films grown on mis-cut substrates. High resolution electron microscopy images
show that the films studied exhibited clean epitaxial growth with a low density
of anti-phase boundaries and stacking faults. Any anti-phase boundaries (APBs)
formed near the film substrate interface rapidly healed rather than extending
through the thickness of the film. Unlike vicinal films grown on annealed
substrates, which contain a high density of anti-phase boundaries, magneto
optical imaging showed no filamentary flux penetration in the films studied.
The flux penetration is, however, asymmetric. This is associated with intrinsic
pinning of flux strings by the tilted a-b planes and the dependence of the
pinning force on the angle between the local field and the a-b planes. Field
angle dependent critical current measurements exhibited the striking vortex
channelling effect previously reported in vicinal films. By combining the
results of three complementary characterisation techniques it is shown that
extended APB free films exhibit markedly different critical current behaviour
as compared to APB rich films. This is attributed to the role of APB sites as
strong pinning centres for Josephson string vortices between the a-b planes.

prescriptions of nonextensive statistical mechanics. In the same manner that
the BG formalism is based on the entropy $S_{BG}=-k \sum_i p_i \ln p_i$, the
nonextensive one is based on the form $S_q=k(1-\sum_ip_i^q)/(q-1)$ (with
$S_1=S_{BG}$). Typically, the systems following the rules derived from the
former exhibit an {\it exponential} relaxation with time toward a stationary

thermal equilibrium}), whereas those following the rules derived from the
latter are characterized by (asymptotic) {\it power-laws} (both the typical
time dependences, and the energy distribution at the stationary state). A brief

dynamics is that of stochastic field equations of the Langevin type, where the
systematic generalized force is a functional derivative of some classical field
Hamiltonian with respect to the field. Equations of this type are generic and
describe many physical systems. It is usually believed that simple non linear
systems exhibit exponential decay in time, while non linear complex systems
,such as ferromagnets at their critical point,decay slowly as a power law or
stretched exponential. A necessary condition for slow decay is that the
eigenvalues of the appropriate Fokker- Planck operator accumulate at zero for
each momentum q .This is a property of the system. I argue here that when the
necessary condition is obeyed slow or fast (exponential) decay are both
possible for simple linear systems as well as for complex non liner ones. The
actual form of decay is determined by what structure factor we prefer to
observe. An explicit family of linear models in which the ""natural"" structure
factors decay exponentially is constructed. It is shown how a more complex
structure factor decays in those models with a slow decay form. It is further
shown how in general non linear systems it is always possible to find structure
factors that decay exponentially. The question of actual observation of such

based on the short-range electron-electron correlations or/and on a short-range
electron-phonon interaction. However, in the cuprates the screening is poor due
to a low carrier density, layered crystal structure, and high ionicity of the
lattice. We develop further the bipolaron model of HTSC, which explicitly takes
into account the long-range origin of all interactions. The long-range
electron-phonon (Froehlich) interaction binds carriers into real space pairs
(small bipolarons) with surprisingly low mass but sufficient binding energy,
while the long-range Coulomb repulsion keeps them from forming larger clusters.
The model has explained many key features of cuprates. Here it is shown that
real-space pairing takes place in many cuprates at variance with some
(incorrect) criteria of the BCS-BEC crossover.

the fine structures of the DOS due to the optical phonons. Then we show that
the numeric inversion of the standard \emph{single-band} EE (the only available

wrong estimates of the strength of certain phonon branches (e.g. the $E_{2g}$)
in the extracted electron-phonon spectral function $\alpha^{2}F(\omega)$. The
fine structures produced by the two-band interaction at energies between 20 and
100 meV turn out to be clearly observable only for tunneling along the $ab$
planes, when the extracted $\alpha ^{2}F(\omega)$ contains the combination
$\alpha ^{2}F_{\sigma \sigma}(\omega)$\textbf{+}$\alpha ^{2}F_{\sigma \pi

it is possible to extract information on the $\sigma$-band contribution to the

author have developed over the past seven years. The study of the frequency
distribution of drawdowns, or runs of successive losses shows that large
financial crashes are ``outliers'': they form a class of their own as can be
seen from their statistical signatures. If large financial crashes are
``outliers'', they are special and thus require a special explanation, a
specific model, a theory of their own. In addition, their special properties
may perhaps be used for their prediction. The main mechanisms leading to
positive feedbacks, i.e., self-reinforcement, such as imitative behavior and
herding between investors are reviewed with many references provided to the
relevant literature outside the confine of Physics. Positive feedbacks provide
the fuel for the development of speculative bubbles, preparing the instability
for a major crash. We demonstrate several detailed mathematical models of
speculative bubbles and crashes. The most important message is the discovery of
robust and universal signatures of the approach to crashes. These precursory
patterns have been documented for essentially all crashes on developed as well
as emergent stock markets, on currency markets, on company stocks, and so on.
The concept of an ``anti-bubble'' is also summarized, with two forward
predictions on the Japanese stock market starting in 1999 and on the USA stock
market still running. We conclude by presenting our view of the organization of
financial markets.

symmetries. In this case, we show that the lattice theory can be obtained by
blocking out of the continuum in a carefully chosen background metric. Such a

potential with power index $n$ at a finite equilibrium value. Redshifting
matter induces oscillations of the scalar field around its equilibrium due to
the scalar field coupling to the trace of the energy momentum tensor. If the
stabilizing potential is sufficiently steep these high frequency oscillations
are consistent with observational and experimental constraints for arbitrary
value of the Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$. We study analytically and
numerically the equation of state of these high frequency oscillations in terms
of the parameters $\omega$ and $n$ and find the corresponding evolution of the
universe scale factor. We find that the equation of state parameter can be
negative and less than -1 but it is not related to the evolution of the scale
factor in the usual way. Nevertheless, accelerating expansion is found for a
certain parameter range. Our analysis applies also to oscillations of the size
of extra dimensions (the radion field) around an equilibrium value. This
duality between self-coupled Brans-Dicke and radion dynamics is applicable for
$\omega= -1 + 1/D$ where D is the number of extra dimensions.

high enough center-of-mass energy should produce black holes. The production
rate for such black holes has been extensively studied for the case of a
proton-proton collision at \sqrt s = 14 TeV and for a lead-lead collision at
\sqrt s = 5.5 TeV at LHC. As the parton energy density is much higher at
lead-lead collisions than in pp collisions at LHC, one natural question is
whether the produced black holes will be able to absorb the partons formed in
the lead-lead collisions and eventually `eat' the quark-gluon plasma formed at
LHC. In this paper, we make a quantitative analysis of this possibility and
find that since the energy density of partons formed in lead-lead collisions at
LHC is about 500 GeV/fm^3, the rate of absorption for one of these black holes
is much smaller than the rate of evaporation. Hence, we argue that black holes
formed in such collisions will decay very quickly, and will not absorb very
many nearby partons. More precisely, we show that for the black hole mass to
increase via parton absorption at the LHC the typical energy density of quarks
and gluons should be of the order of 10^{10} GeV/fm^3. As LHC will not be able
to produce such a high energy density partonic system, the black hole will not
be able to absorb a sufficient number of nearby partons before it decays. The
typical life time of the black hole formed at LHC is found to be a small
fraction of a fm/c.

consistently reproduced using an effective Lagrangian model. The effects of the

the definition of OM theory, as well as the arguments showing that it is part
of a larger, eleven-dimensional structure known as Galilean or Wrapped M2-brane

for several reasons, in particular because it is essentially a toy model of

collisions of Au on Au at incident energies between 40 and 150 AMeV have been
measured with the 4-pi multi-detector INDRA. The maximum of the fragment
production is located near mid-rapidity at the lower energies and moves
gradually towards the projectile and target rapidities as the energy is
increased. Schematic calculations within an extended Goldhaber model suggest
that the observed cross-section distributions and their evolution with energy
are predominantly the result of the clustering requirement for the emerging
fragments and of their Coulomb repulsion from the projectile and target
residues. The quantitative comparison with transverse energy spectra and
fragment charge distributions emphasizes the role of hard scattered nucleons in
the fragmentation process.

one and the apparent lack of a nuclear suppression of the baryon yield in this
momentum range. Fragmentation becomes dominant at higher transverse momentum,
but the transition point is delayed by the energy loss of fast partons in dense
matter.

of epilepsy. These potentials originate as a result of synchronous,
pathological discharge of many neurons. The reliable detection of such
potentials has been the long standing problem in EEG analysis, especially after
long-term monitoring became common in investigation of epileptic patients. The
traditional definition of a spike is based on its amplitude, duration,
sharpness, and emergence from its background. However, spike detection systems
built solely around this definition are not reliable due to the presence of
numerous transients and artifacts. We use wavelet transform to analyze the
properties of EEG manifestations of epilepsy. We demonstrate that the behavior
of wavelet transform of epileptic spikes across scales can constitute the
foundation of a relatively simple yet effective detection algorithm.

can communicate with the server using both classical and quantum channels.
Resources do not share secret keys with each other, so that the key
distribution problem for the network is reduced from O(n^2) to O(n). Some
advantages of the protocol are that it avoids the requirement for timestamps
used in classical protocols, guarantees that the trusted server cannot know the
authentication key, can provide resistance to multiple photon splitting attacks
and can be used with BB84 or other quantum key distribution protocols.

both shallow wide field and deep pencil beam, performed with three different

statistics the largest possible flux range so far: [2.4*10^-17 - 10^-11] cgs in
the soft band and [2.1*10^-16 - 8*10^{-12}]cgs in the hard band. Integrating
the flux distributions over this range and taking into account the (small)
contribution of the brightest sources we derive the flux density generated by
discrete sources in both bands. After a critical review of the literature
values of the total Cosmic X--Ray Background (CXB) we conclude that, with the
present data, the 94.3%, and 88.8% of the soft and hard CXB can be ascribed to
discrete source emission. If we extrapolate the analytical form of the Log
N--Log S distribution beyond the flux limit of our catalog in the soft band we
find that the flux from discrete sources at ~3*10^-18 cgs is consistent with
the entire CXB, whereas in the hard band it accounts for only 93% of the total
CXB at most, hinting for a faint and obscured population to arise at even
fainter fluxes.

disc containing a toroidal magnetic field. All fluid perturbations are singular
at the so--called magnetic resonances, where the Doppler shifted frequency of
the perturbation matches that of a slow MHD wave propagating along the field
line. These lie on both sides of the corotation radius. Waves propagate outside
the Lindblad resonances, and also in a restricted region around the magnetic
resonances. The magnetic resonances contribute to a significant global torque
which, like the Lindblad torque, is negative (positive) inside (outside) the
planet's orbit. Since these resonances are closer to the planet than the
Lindblad resonances, the torque they contribute dominates over the Lindblad
torque if the magnetic field is large enough. In addition, if beta=c^2/v_A^2
increases fast enough with radius, the outer magnetic resonance becomes less
important and the total torque is then negative, dominated by the inner
magnetic resonance. This leads to outward migration of the planet. Even for
beta=100 at corotation, a negative torque may be obtained. A planet migrating
inward through a nonmagnetized region of a disc would then stall when reaching
a magnetized region. It would then be able to grow to become a terrestrial
planet or the core of a giant planet. In a turbulent magnetized disc in which
the large scale field structure changes sufficiently slowly, a planet may
alternate between inward and outward migration, depending on the gradients of
the field encountered. Its migration could then become diffusive, or be limited
only to small scales.

Eddington accretion ratios over a range of redshifts, i.e., with cosmological

luminosities and velocity dispersions of their host-galaxy bulges. These masses

consider two limiting corners of the available parameter space -- crowded
systems containing N=10 giant planets in the outer solar system, and solar
systems with N=2 planets that are tidally interacting with a circumstellar
disk. For a given set of initial conditions, dynamical relaxation leads to a
well-defined distribution of possible solar systems. For each class of initial
conditions, we perform large numbers of N-body simulations to obtain a
statistical description of the possible outcomes. For N=10 planet systems, we
consider several different planetary mass distributions; we also perform
secondary sets of simulations to explore chaotic behavior and longer term
dynamical evolution. For systems with 10 planets initially populating the
radial range 5 - 30 AU, these scattering processes naturally produce planetary
orbits with $a\sim1$ AU and the full range of possible eccentricity, but
shorter period orbits are difficult to achieve. To account for the observed
eccentric giant planets, we also explore a mechanism that combines dynamical
scattering and tidal interactions with a circumstellar disk. This combined
model naturally produces the observed range of semi-major axis and
eccentricity. We discuss the relative merits of the different migration

expand P_{in}(k) directly in wavelet basis functions. The likelihood of the

the H_0, \Omega_b h^2, $\Omega_c h^2 and the \tau_{ri}, in a flat $\Lambda$CDM

(WMAP, CBI, and ACBAR) and large scale structure (LSS) data (2dFGRS and PSCZ)
using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. The direct wavelet
expansion method is different and complimentary to the wavelet band power
method of Mukherjee & Wang (2003a,b), and results from the two methods are
consistent. In addition, as we demonstrate, the direct wavelet expansion method
has the advantage that once the wavelet coefficients have been constrained, the
reconstruction of P_{in}(k) can be effectively denoised, i.e., P_{in}(k) can be
reconstructed using only the coefficients that, say, deviate from zero at
greater than 1\sigma. In doing so the essential properties of P_{in}(k) are
retained. The reconstruction also suffers much less from the correlated errors
of binning methods. The shape of the primordial power spectrum, as
reconstructed in detail here, reveals an interesting new feature at 0.001 \la
k/{Mpc}^{-1} \la 0.005. It will be interesting to see if this feature is
confirmed by future data. The reconstructed and denoised P_{in}(k) is favored
over the scale-invariant and power-law forms at \ga 1\sigma.

improvements compared to earlier models, including a detailed treatment of the
effects of sputtering, a detailed calculation of the radiation pressure on the
grain, and the treatment of subsonic drift velocities. In terms of drift
velocity between the grains and gas in the envelope, we find that the ice
formation process can be divided into three regimes: (i) a sputtering dominated
regime where ice growth is heavily suppressed, (ii) an intermediate regime with
moderately efficient condensation and (iii) a thermally dominated regime where
ice formation is highly efficient. Sputtering is the critical factor which
determines if ice formation can occur at all. We find that in Red Supergiants,
ice formation is suppressed, while the winds of OH/IR stars allow for efficient
condensation and can convert significant fractions of the available water vapor
(tens of percent) into ice mantles on grains. Population II AGB stars hardly
form ice due to their low dust to gas ratios. We also modify an analytical
equation describing condensation and depletion (Jura and Morris, 1985) in order
to give reasonable results for high and low drift velocities. Initially, ice
will condense in crystalline form, but continuing condensation at low
temperatures, and damage caused by interstellar UV photons favor the production
of amorphous ice as well. We predict that a significant fraction of the ice
formed will be amorphous.

isolated: one related to the randomized pulsar wind and the other to the
propelled wind, both boosted by the ultra-relativistic Quark Nova shock. The
latter component acquires energies $10^{15} {\rm eV}<E<10^{18} {\rm eV}$ while
the former, boosted pulsar wind, achieves ultra-high energies $E> 10^{18.6}$
eV. The composition is dominated by ions present in the pulsar wind in the
energy range above $10^{18.6}$ eV, while at energies below $10^{18}$ eV the
propelled ejecta, consisting of the fall-back neutron star crust material from
the explosion, is the dominant one. Added to these two components, the
propeller injects relativistic particles with Lorentz factors $\Gamma_{\rm
prop.} \sim 1-1000$, later to be accelerated by galactic supernova shocks. The
QN model appears to be able to account for the extragalactic cosmic rays above
the ankle and to contribute a few percent of the galactic cosmic rays below the

emphasis both on the radio galaxies and on the diffuse radio emission from the
intracluster medium. We show that the formation of the tailed morphology in
cluster radio galaxies is due to the effect of the cluster gaseous environment
and of its large scale motions in merging clusters. From Chandra X-ray data, it
has also become evident that the gas in the hot cluster atmospheres may be
displaced by the relativistic plasma. The statistical characteristics of radio
galaxies are briefly discussed, and are shown to be surprisingly similar for
sources both inside and outside rich clusters. The study of diffuse radio
sources originating from the intracluster medium (halos and relics) has
presently become a major area of investigation. Halos and relics are detected
in massive X-ray luminous clusters which are undergoing violent merger
processes. The power of radio halos is correlated with the cluster X-ray
luminosity and mass.

that the different variability types have different P-L distributions. Both the
Mira variables and the SRb variables have reasonably well-defined

elastic continuum that causes large deformations. The minimal potential energy
and the corresponding displacement field is calculated by solving the
Euler-Lagrange-equations. The nonlinear incompressibility constraint is
rigorously taken into account. By using an appropriate curvilinear coordinate
system a finer resolution in the regions of large deformations is obtained and
the dimension of the arising nonlinear PDE's is reduced to two. The extensive
algebraic calculations that arise are done by a computer algebra system (CAS).
The PDE's are then solved by a difference scheme using the Newton-Raphson
algorithm of successive approximations for multidimensional equations.
Additional features for global convergence are implemented. To obtain basic
states that are sufficiently close to the solution, a one dimensional
linearized version of the equation is solved with a numerical computation that
reproduces the analytical results of Huang and Mura (1970). With this method,
rigorous solutions of the nonlinear equations without any additional
simplifications can be obtained. The numerical results show a contraction of
the singularity line which corresponds to the well-known Poynting effect in
nonlinear elasticity. This combination of analytical and numerical computations
proves to be a versatile method to solve nonlinear boundary value problems in
complicated geometries.

dipolar interactions are mainly responsible for the temperature dependence of
the lineshapes for all three SMMs, and that the intermolecular exchange
interaction is more significant for Mn$_4$ than for the other two SMMs. This

number is identified as a discriminating characteristic, and for rough-surfaced

suggesting that this is governed by local linear equations of constraint
between the stress components. These constraints can in turn be related to the
generalised forces conjugate to the motion of grains rolling over each other.
The lack of a spatially coherent way of imposing a sign convention on these
motions is a problem for up-scaling the equations, which leads us to attempt a
renormalisation group calculation. Finally we discuss how perturbations
propagate through such systems, suggesting a distinction between the behaviour
of rough and of smooth grains.

between production rates of $D^+$ and of $D^-$ in their inclusive productions,
and also asymmetries for other charmed hadrons. These asymmetries are observed
in experiment and are called as leading particle effects. In this work we give
a general analysis for contributions of quark recombination to these
asymmetries. The contributions consist of a perturbative- and nonperturbative
part. We perform two types of factorization by considering the produced hadron
with large transverse momentum and by taking charm quark as a heavy quark,
respectively. In the case of large transverse momentum the effect of quark
recombination is the standard twist-4 effect. We find that the contributions
are parameterized with four nonperturbative functions, defined with four quark
operators at twist-4, for initial hadrons without polarization. By taking charm
quark as a heavy quark the factorization can be performed with the heavy quark
effective theory(HQET). The effect of quark recombination is in general
parameterized by eight nonperturbative parameters which are defined as
integrals with matrix elements of four quark operators defined in HQET. For
unpolarized hadrons in the initial state, the parameters can effectively be
reduced to four. Perturbative parts in the two types of factorization are
calculated at tree-level.

accompanied by a dramatic rise in the number of degrees of freedom. In string
theory, this phenomenon is expected to occur for branes at a generic threefold
singularity, for which the associated quiver has Lorentzian signature. We here
study sequences of Seiberg dualities on branes at the C_3/Z_3 orbifold
singularity. We use the naive beta functions to define an (unphysical) scale
along the cascade. We determine, as a function of initial conditions, the scale
of the wall as well as the critical exponent governing the approach to it. The
position of the wall is piecewise linear, while the exponent appears to be

$H = \half \Delta + V$, where $\Delta$ is the positive Laplacian with respect

show that the kernel of U(t) is, up to an explicit quadratic oscillatory
factor, a class of `Legendre distributions' on $X \times X^{\circ} \times

and E_fc are treated as submanifolds of infinite jet spaces. We show that flat
representations include several known types of zero-curvature formulations of

their reductions are of this type. With each flat representation we associate a
complex C_f of vector-valued differential forms such that its first cohomology
describes infinitesimal deformations of the flat structure, which are
responsible, in particular, for parameters in Backlund transformations. In
addition, each higher infinitesimal symmetry S of E defines a 1-cocycle c_S of
C_f. Symmetries with exact c_S form a subalgebra reflecting some geometric
properties of E and f. We show that the complex corresponding to E_fc itself is
0-acyclic and 1-acyclic (independently of the bundle topology), which means
that higher symmetries of E_fc are exhausted by generalized gauge ones, and
compute the bracket on 0-cochains induced by commutation of symmetries.

systems with controllable resonances together with their quantum counterpart.
As an application of such tailormade resonances we reveal the role of
Ruelle--Pollicott resonances for the localization properties of quantum energy
eigenstates.

infinite-dimensional manifolds with involutive distributions and consider their
special morphisms called differential coverings, which include constructions
like Lax pairs and Backlund transformations. We show that, similarly to usual
coverings in topology, at least for some PDEs differential coverings are
determined by actions of a sort of fundamental group. This is not a group, but
a certain system of Lie algebras, which generalize Wahlquist-Estabrook
algebras. From this we deduce an algebraic necessary condition for two PDEs to
be connected by a Backlund transformation. We compute these
infinite-dimensional Lie algebras for several KdV type equations and prove
non-existence of Backlund transformations.
  As a by-product, for some class of Lie algebras g we prove that any
subalgebra of g of finite codimension contains an ideal of g of finite
codimension.

soften the symmetry energy and reshape the theoretical neutron drip line
without compromising the agreement with existing ground-state information. A
strong correlation between the neutron radius of 208Pb and the binding energy
of valence orbitals is found: the smaller the neutron radius of 208Pb, the
weaker the binding energy of the last occupied neutron orbital. Thus, models
with the softest symmetry energy are the first ones to drip neutrons. Further,
in anticipation of the upcoming one-percent measurement of the neutron radius
of 208Pb at the Thomas Jefferson Laboratory, a close relationship between the
neutron radius of 208Pb and neutron radii of elements of relevance to atomic

technique, a delayed-pulse of strong oR-resonant infrared radiation sweeps the
laser-induced Stark-shift of a two-photon transition in a such way that
facilitates robust maximum two-photon coherence induced by the first
ultraviolet laser. A judiciously delayed third pulse scatters at this coherence
and generates short-wavelength radiation. A theoretical analysis of these
problems based on the density matrix is performed. A numerical model is
developed to carry out simulations of a typical experiment. The results
illustrate a behavior of populations, coherence and generated radiation along

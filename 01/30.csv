distribution for the point sources, we propose a method aimed to determine the
slope of the distribution from the analysis of the moments of the observed

simultaneous thresholding of the filtered map at all frequencies, with a
relatively low threshold. With this strategy, we expect to find 70 (95)% of the
sources above 3 (4) $\sigma$. Assuming the most conservative case for point
sources detection, the recovered slope of the point sources distribution is
$2.55 \pm 0.15$, for a fiducial $n=2.5$ value. The recovered CMB pus noise map
variance is within 0.2% from the real one, with a standard deviation of $0.31

  specific correspondence welcome (to nemiroff@mtu.edu)",,"10.1086/374571",,"astro-ph",,"  To maximize the number of transients discovered on the sky, should
sky-monitoring projects stare at one location or continually jump from location
to location, tiling the sky? If tiling is preferred, what cadence maximizes the
discovery rate? As sky monitoring is a growing part of astronomical observing,
utilized to find such phenomena as supernovae, microlensing, and planet
transits, well thought out answers to these questions are increasingly
important. Answers are sky, source, and telescope dependent and should include
information about the source luminosity distribution near the observation
limit, the duration of variability, the nature of the dominant noise, and the
magnitude of down and slew times. Usually, a critical slope of the effective
cumulative transient apparent luminosity distribution (Log N - Log S) at the
limiting magnitude will define when ""tile"" or ""stare"" is superior. For
shallower slopes, when ""tile"" is superior, optimal cadences and pointing
algorithms are discussed. For transients discovered on a single exposure or
time-contiguous series of exposures, when down and slew times are small and the
character of the noise is unchanged, the most productive cadence for isotropic
power-law luminosity distributions is the duration of the transient -- faster
cadences waste time re-discovering known transients, while slower cadences
neglect transients occurring in other fields. A ""cadence creep"" strategy might
find an optimal discovery cadence experimentally when one is not uniquely
predetermined theoretically. Guest investigator programs might diversify
previously dedicated sky monitoring telescopes by implementing bandpasses and
cadences chosen to optimize the discovery of different types of transients.
Example analyses are given for SuperMACHO, LSST, and GLAST.

characterized by its relative optical and X-ray faintness, its X-ray hardness
and its X-ray strength compared to optically selected quasars at high redshift.
We also compare the X-ray selected high redshift radio quiet quasars to their

slope, $\alpha_{ox}$, is statistically harder (more X-ray luminous) for the
X-ray selected radio quiet quasars than for the optically selected ones. This
result, given the different range of rest frame ultraviolet luminosities
studied and the selection of the samples, is consistent with the previously
found correlation between X-ray and rest frame ultraviolet luminosities and
would extend that result to a much wider luminosity range at high redshift.

fundamental link between their assembly and the formation of their host
spheroids. We model the growth and activity of black holes in galaxies using
LambdaCDM cosmological hydrodynamic simulations by following the evolution of
the baryonic mass component in galaxy potential wells. We find that the
observed steep relation between black hole mass and spheroid velocity
dispersion, M_BH propto \sigma^4, is reproduced if the gas mass in bulges is
linearly proportional to the black hole mass. In this model, black hole growth
saturates because of the competition with star-formation and feedback, both of
which determine the gas fraction available for accretion. Unless other
processes also operate, we predict that the M_BH-sigma$ relation is not set in
primordial structures but is fully established at low redshifts, $z \approxlt
2$, and is shallower at earlier times. We find that that central black hole
masses are related to their dark matter halos simply via M_BH ~ M_DM^4/3. We
assume that galaxies undergo a quasar phase with a typical lifetime, t_Q ~
2\times 10^7 yr and show that star-formation regulated depletion of gas in
spheroids can explain the decrease of the quasar population at redshift z<3 in
the optical blue band. However, with the simplest assumption of a redshift
independent quasar lifetime, the model overpredicts optical quasar numbers at
high redshifts although it yields the observed evolution of number density of
X-ray quasars over the redshift range 1 < z< 6. Finally, we find that the
majority of black hole mass is assembled in galaxies by z ~ 3 and that the
black hole accretion rate density peaks in rough correspondence to the star
formation rate density at z ~ 4-5.

MCG-6-30-15 is studied using the EPIC pn data obtained from a 2001 observation

The spectrum of 80 ks of data from when the source was bright, using the the
lowest 10 ks as background, is well fitted over the 3-10 keV band with a simple
power-law of photon index Gamma=2.11. The source spectrum can therefore be
decomposed into an approximately constant component, containing a strong iron
emission line, and a variable power law component. Assuming that the power-law
continuum extends down to 0.5 keV enables us to deduce the absorption acting on
the nucleus. A simple model involving Galactic absorption and 2 photoelectric
edges (at 0.72 and 0.86 keV) is adequate for the EPIC spectrum above 1 keV. It
still gives a fair representation of the spectrum at lower energies where
absorption lines, UTAs etc are expected. Applying the absorption model to the
low flux spectrum enables us to characterize it as reflection-dominated with
iron about 3 times Solar. Fitting this model, with an additional power-law
continuum, to 32 x 10 ks spectra of the whole observation reveals that Gamma
lies mostly between 2 and 2.3 and the normalization of the reflection-dominated
component varies by up to 25 per cent. The breadth of the iron line suggests
that most of the illumination originates from about 2 gravitational radii.
Gravitational light bending will be very strong there, causing the observed
continuum to be a strong function of the source height and much of the
continuum radiation to return to the disk. Together these effects can explain
the otherwise puzzling disconnectedness of the continuum and reflection
components of MCG-6-30-15.

The $\kappa_\ell$ spectrum is shown to reflect the number, importance and
relative orientation of principal directions in the CMB correlation dictated by
the shape of the Dirichlet domain (DD) of the compact space and its size

$\kappa_\ell$ can discriminate between different topology of the universe

Employing velocity- and integrals of motion-phase space projections of these
stars, coupled with a series of N-body/Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH)
chemodynamical simulations, we suggest an alternative mechanism for creating
such stars may be the recent accretion of a polar orbit dwarf galaxy.

is found to coincide with an X-ray source. The SCUBA population as a whole is
not significantly detected in either the 0.5-2 keV or the 2-10 keV X-ray bands,
even after coadding the X-ray flux at the SCUBA positions, in both fields. The
18 X-ray sources within the CUDSS 3hr map yield a mean sub-mm flux of
0.48+-0.27 mJy after coadding the sub-mm flux at the X-ray positions. Using
this result we place an upper limit on the contribution of AGN to the sub-mm
background at 850 microns of ~7 per cent. Conversely we estimate the
contribution of sub-mm sources to the 0.5-2 keV X-ray background to be <16.5
per cent. These results strongly support the conclusion that the two
backgrounds are caused by different processes, in the one case nucleosynthesis
in stars, in the other accretion onto black-holes. We conclude that it is
possible for SCUBA sources in general to contain AGN, as long as they are
Compton-thick and are at z>2.3. The ratio of the X-ray to sub-mm flux for the
X-ray sources however, implies that even when a galaxy does contain an AGN,
most of the energy heating the dust is from young stars and not from the active

is increasing monotonically towards the centre in the unsaturated part of the

efficiently rejects most of the cosmics which would otherwise lead to a large
number of false detections. The quality of the algorithm was evaluated with the
help of a large set of simulated data for the DIVA satellite mission; different
assumptions were made for the noise level, and the presence of cosmics or for a
variable sky background. We could show that our algorithm fulfills the
requirements for DIVA; only in the case of simulated images which included the

disordered phase of the same symmetry with a volume expansion of 5.4%, among
the largest ever observed. We study the lattice dynamics of solid cubane within
the quasi-harmonic and rigid-molecule approximation to explain some of these
unusual dynamical properties. The calculated phonon density of states,
dispersion curves and thermal expansion agree surprisingly well with available
experimental data. We find that the amplitude of thermally excited
orientational excitations (i.e. librons) increases rapidly with increasing
temperature and reaches about 35$^{\rm o}$ just before the orientational phase
transition. Hence, the transition is driven by large-amplitude collective
motions of the cubane molecules. Similarly the amplitude of the translational
excitations shows a strong temperature dependence and reaches one tenth of the
lattice constant at T=440 K. This temperature is in fair agreement with the
experimental melting temperature of 405 K, indicating that the Lindemann
criterion works well even for this unusual molecular solid.

increase with radiation intensity, easily exceeding the dark resistivity and
resulting in negative-resistivity minima. At high intensity, we identify
additional features, likely due to multi-photon processes, which have yet to be

specific sites located in the regulatory region of the gene. The generation of
these binding sites and of cooperativity between them are essential building
blocks in the evolution of complex regulatory networks. We study a theoretical
model for the sequence evolution of binding sites by point mutations. The
approach is based on biophysical models for the binding of transcription
factors to DNA. Hence we derive empirically grounded fitness landscapes, which
enter a population genetics model including mutations, genetic drift, and
selection. We show that the selection for factor binding generically leads to
specific correlations between nucleotide frequencies at different positions of
a binding site. We demonstrate the possibility of rapid adaptive evolution
generating a new binding site for a given transcription factor by point
mutations. The evolutionary time required is estimated in terms of the neutral
(background) mutation rate, the selection coefficient, and the effective
population size. The efficiency of binding site formation is seen to depend on
two joint conditions: the binding site motif must be short enough and the
promoter region must be long enough. These constraints on promoter architecture
are indeed seen in eukaryotic systems. Furthermore, we analyse the adaptive
evolution of genetic switches and of signal integration through binding
cooperativity between different sites. Experimental tests of this picture

These electrons can be electrostatically held and manipulated much like

identify the low-energy effective theory that describes the electronic spin
sector of the stripe as that of a sine-Gordon model. We determine its phases
via a perturbative renormalization group analysis. For realistic values of the
model parameters we obtain a phase characterized by enhanced spin density and
composite charge density wave correlations, coexisting with subleading triplet
and composite singlet pairing correlations. This result is shown to be
independent of the spatial orientation of the stripe on the square lattice.
Slow transverse fluctuations of the stripes tend to suppress the density
correlations, thus promoting the pairing instabilities. The largest amplitudes
for the composite instabilities appear when the stripe forms an antiphase
domain wall in the antiferromagnet. For twisted spin alignments the amplitudes
decrease and leave room for a new type of composite pairing correlation,

generally described by a one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) Ansatz. The
Gardner transition, i.e. a very-low-temperature phase transition to a full
replica symmetry breaking (FRSB) phase, is often regarded as an inessential,
and somehow exotic phenomenon. In this paper we show that the metastable states
which are relevant for the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of such systems are
always in a FRSB phase. The only exceptions are (to the best of our knowledge)
the p-spin spherical model and the random energy model (REM). We also discuss
the consequences of our results for aging dynamics and for local search
algorithms in hard combinatorial problems.

`free-fermion' model has a non-linearly realized $SU(n|1)$ symmetry; it can be

S(epsilon;t,s) are introduced to describe systems with nonzero or zero Lyapunov
exponents or systems that exhibit strong intermittent behavior with
``flights'', trappings, weak mixing, etc. The important part of the new notions
is the first appearance of epsilon-separation of initially close trajectories.
The complexity function is similar to the propagator p(t0,x0;t,x) with a
replacement of x by the natural lengths s of trajectories, and its introduction
does not assume of the space-time independence in the process of evolution of
the system. A special stress is done on the choice of variables and the
replacement t by eta=ln(t), s by xi=ln(s) makes it possible to consider
time-algebraic and space-algebraic complexity and some mixed cases. It is shown
that for typical cases the entropy function S(epsilon;xi,eta) possesses
invariants (alpha,beta) that describe the fractal dimensions of the space-time
structures of trajectories. The invariants (alpha,beta) can be linked to the
transport properties of the system, from one side, and to the Riemann
invariants for simple waves, from the other side. This analog provides a new
meaning for the transport exponent mu that can be considered as the speed of a
Riemann wave in the log-phase space of the log-space-time variables. Some other
applications of new notions are considered and numerical examples are

lead to nutrient depletion in its habitat. One can assume that such
interconnection between unicellular organisms was evolutionarily developed and
genetically fixed. I assumed that modern unicellular organisms retain such an
ability to regulate their total numbers. The validity of this assumption was
tested in experiments, whose results are presented in this paper.

radiation from independent dipole magnets. However, in the damping rings of
future linear colliders, a large fraction of the radiation power will be
emitted in damping wigglers. In this paper, the longitudinal wakefield and
impedance due to CSR in a wiggler are derived in the limit of a large wiggler
parameter $K$. After an appropriate scaling, the results can be expressed in
terms of universal functions, which are independent of $K$. Analytical
asymptotic results are obtained for the wakefield in the limit of large and
small distances, and for the impedance in the limit of small and high
frequencies.

binding energy is not satisfactory. Both in atoms and in nuclei the organizing
principle of stability is the shell structure, while this does not seem to play
any role for particles. In order to explore the possibility that shells might
also be relevant at this inner level of aggregation, atomic and nuclear
stability are expressed by ""stablines"", alignments of the 1/3 power of the
total number of constituents of the most stable configurations. Could similar
patterns be found in the particle spectrum? By analyzing the distribution of
particle lifetimes as a function of mass, stability peaks are recognized for
mesons and for baryons and indeed the cube roots of their masses follow two
distinct stablines. Such alignments would be a strong indication that the
particles themselves are shell structured assuming only that each constituent
contributes a constant amount to the total mass. This is incompatible with the
prevalent view that the partons--real physical constituents seen in
deep-inelastic scattering experiments--are the quarks. The mass of the Bc
predicted by interpolation with the meson stabline is 7.4 +/-0.2 GeV. On the
baryon stabline new baryon states are predicted at 3.9 and 7.6 GeV.

of the probe field can be partially transferred to the sidebands. We show that
a necessary condition for the output fields to be in an entangled state or,
more generally, in a nonclassical state is that the input field state is a
nonclassical state.

polarization on a two-level damped atom. The results demonstrate interesting ac
Stark split of energy levels of damped atom. The split levels have different
energies and lifetimes, both of which depend on the interaction and the damping
rate of atom. When the frequency of the EM wave is tuned to satisfy the
resonance condition in the strong coupling limit, the transition probability
exhibits Rabi oscillation. Momentum transfer between atom and EM wave shows
similar properties as the transition probability under resonance condition. For
a damped atom interacting with EM field, there exists no longer stable state.
More importantly, if the angular frequency of the EM wave is tuned the same as
the atomic transition frequency and its amplitude is adjusted appropriately
according to the damping coefficients, we can prepare a particular 'Dressed
State' of the coupled system between atom and EM field and can keep the system
coherently in this 'Dressed state' for a very long time. This opens another way
to prepare coherent atomic states.

galaxies, groups and clusters are not entirely efficient, leaving substantial
amounts of dense substructure, in the form of stripped halo cores or
`subhaloes', orbiting within these systems. Using a semi-analytic model of
satellite dynamics, we study the evolution of haloes as they merge
hierarchically, to determine how much substructure survives merging and how the
properties of individual subhaloes change over time. We find that subhaloes
evolve, due to mass loss, orbital decay, and tidal disruption, on a
characteristic time-scale equal to the period of radial oscillations at the
virial radius of the system. Subhaloes with realistic densities and density
profiles lose 25-45 per cent of their mass per pericentric passage, depending
on their concentration and on the circularity of their orbit. As the halo
grows, the subhalo orbits also grow in size and become less bound. Based on
these general patterns, we suggest a method for including realistic amounts of
substructure in semi-analytic models based on merger trees. We show that the
parameters in the resulting model can be fixed by requiring self-consistency
between different levels of the merger hierarchy. In a companion paper, we will
compare the results of our model with numerical simulations of halo formation.

in a circumstellar disk in 2d, during the period in which the companion makes
its transition from `Type I' to `Type II' migration, using a PPM code. Spiral
waves are generated by the gravitational torque of the planet on the disk.
Their effects are to cause the planet to migrate inward and the disk to form a
deep (low surface density) gap. Until a transition to slower Type II migration,
the migration rate of the planet is of order 1 AU/10$^3$ yr, and varies by less
than a factor of two with a factor twenty change in planet mass, but depends
near linearly on the disk mass. Although the disk is stable to self gravitating
perturbations (Toomre $Q>5$ everywhere), migration is faster by a factor of two
or more when self gravity is suppressed. Migration is equally sensitive to the
disk's mass distribution within 1--2 Hill radii of the planet, as demonstrated
by our simulations' sensitivity to the planet's assumed gravitational softening
parameter. Rapid migration can continue after gap formation. Gaps are typically
several AU in width and display the \mplan$^{2/3}$ proportionality predicted by
theory. Beginning from an initially unperturbed 0.05\msun disk, planets of mass
$M_{\rm pl}> 0.3$\mj can open a gap deep and wide enough to complete the
transition to slower \ttwo migration. Lower mass objects continue to migrate
rapidly, eventually impacting the inner boundary of our grid. This transition
mass is much larger than that predicted as the `Shiva mass' discussed in Ward
and Hahn (2000), making the survival of forming planets even more precarious
than they would predict.

not physically reasonable in the limit of either a thin, circumplanetary disk
or of a spherical envelope. Planet growth and ultimately survival are therefore
limited to the planet's ability to accept additional matter, not by the disk in
which it resides. We find that common analytic torque approximations predict
values that are a factor $\sim10$ larger than those obtained from the
simulations. Accounting for the disk's vertical structure (crudely modeled
through a gravitational softening parameter), small shifts in resonance
positions due to pressure gradients, to disk self gravity and to inclusion of
non-WKB terms in the analysis (Artymowicz 1993) reduce the difference to a
factor $\sim3-6$. Torques from the corotation resonances that are positive in
sign contribute 20-30% or more of the net torque on the planet. The assumption
of linearity underlying theoretical analyses is recovered in the simulations
with planets with masses below 0.5\mj, but the assumption that interactions
occur only at the resonances is more difficult to support. The detailed shape
of the disk's response varies from pattern to pattern, making its true position
less clear. We speculate that the finite width allows for overlap and mixing
between resonances and may be responsible for the remainder of the differences
between torques from theory and simulation, but whether accounting for such
overlap in a theory will improve the agreement with the simulations is not
clear.

rays have been normally treated with the simplifying assumption of infinite
diffusion along magnetic field lines but no diffusion across them. The cosmic
ray diffusion is, however, finite. In this work, we take into account fully the
diffusion process of cosmic rays in a linear stability analysis of the Parker
instability. Cosmic rays are described with the diffusion-convection equation.
With realistic values of cosmic ray diffusion coefficients expected in the
interstellar medium, we show that the result of previous studies with the
simplifying assumption on cosmic ray diffusion applies well. Finiteness of
parallel diffusion decreases the growth rate of the Parker instability, while
the relatively smaller perpendicular diffusion has no significant effect. We

marks the formation of normal stars. Thus the fraction of PopIII objects formed
as a function of redshift is heavily dependent on the distribution of metals
and fairly independent of the precise value of Z_cr. Using an analytical model
of inhomogenous structure formation, we study the evolution of PopIII objects
as a function of the star formation efficiency, IMF, and efficiency of outflow
generation. For all models, PopIII objects tend to be in the 10^6.5-10^7.0
solar mass range, just large enough to cool within a Hubble time, but small
enough that they are not clustered near areas of previous star formation.
Although the mean metallicity exceeds Z_cr at a redshift of 15 in all models,
the peak of PopIII star formation occurs at z \sim 10, and such stars continue
to form well into the observable range. We discuss the observational properties
of these objects, some of which may have already been detected in ongoing
surveys of high-redshift Lyman-alpha emitters. Finally, we combine our PopIII
distributions with the yield models of Heger and Woosley (2002) to study their

their peculiar elemental yields help to reconcile theoretical models with the

are studied using a sample of nearly 9000 galaxies, selected from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey using morphological and spectral criteria. In this sample,
redder galaxies have larger velocity dispersions. Color also correlates with
magnitude and size, but these correlations are entirely due to the L-sigma and
R_o-sigma relations: the primary correlation is color-sigma. The red light in
early-type galaxies is, on average, slightly more centrally concentrated than
the blue. Because of these color gradients, the strength of the
color--magnitude relation depends on whether or not the colors are defined
using a fixed metric aperture. Chemical evolution and star formation histories
of early-type galaxies are investigated using co-added spectra of similar
objects. At fixed sigma, the population at z ~ 0.2 had weaker Mg_2 and stronger
H_beta absorption compared to the population at z ~ 0. It was also bluer.
Comparison of these colors and line-strengths, and their evolution, with
single-burst stellar population models suggests a formation time of 9 Gyrs ago,
consistent with a Fundamental Plane analysis of this sample.

burst, which reveal a rapidly-fading ``radio flare''. Based on its temporal and
spectral properties, we interpret the radio flare as emission from the reverse
shock. This scenario rules out a circumburst medium with a radial density
profile \rho ~ r^{-2} expected around a mass-losing massive star, since in that
case the reverse shock emission decays on the timescale of the burst duration
t~100 s. Using published optical and X-ray data, along with the radio data
presented here, we further show that a self-consistent model requires
collimated ejecta with an opening angle of 6 degrees (t_j~0.95 days). As a
consequence of the early jet break, the late-time (t>10 days) emission measured
with the Hubble Space Telescope significantly deviates from an extrapolation of
the early, ground-based data. This, along with an unusually red spectrum, F_\nu
\~ \nu^{-3.9}, strengthens the case for a supernova that exploded at about the
same time as GRB 020405, thus pointing to a massive stellar progenitor for this
burst. This is the first clear association of a massive progenitor with a
uniform medium, indicating that a \rho ~ r^{-2} profile is not a required

afterglow in the majority of bursts.

deep image of the field surrounding the quasar SDSSp J104433.04$-$012502.2 at a
redshift of 5.74. Comparing this image with optical broad-band images, we have
found an object with a very strong emission line. Our follow-up optical
spectroscopy has revealed that this source is at a redshift of
$z=5.655\pm0.002$, forming stars at a rate $\sim 13 ~ h_{0.7}^{-2} ~ M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$. Remarkably, the velocity dispersion of Ly$\alpha$-emitting gas is
only 22 km s$^{-1}$. Since a blue half of the Ly$\alpha$ emission could be
absorbed by neutral hydrogen gas, perhaps in the system, a modest estimate of
the velocity dispersion may be $\gtrsim$ 44 km s$^{-1}$. Together with a linear
size of 7.7 $h_{0.7}^{-1}$ kpc, we estimate a lower limit of the dynamical mass
of this object to be $\sim 2 \times 10^9 M_\odot$. It is thus suggested that
LAE J1044$-$0123 is a star-forming dwarf galaxy (i.e., a subgalactic object or
a building block) beyond redshift 5 although we cannot exclude a possibility
that most Ly$\alpha$ emission is absorbed by the red damping wing of neutral
intergalactic matter.

We use, for the first time, width measurements based on high resolution and
high signal to noise ratio CCD spectra and absolute visual magnitudes from the
Hipparcos database. Our primary goal is to investigate the possibility of using
the Wilson--Bappu effect to determine accurate distances to single stars and
groups. The result of our calibration fitting of the Wilson--Bappu relationship
is M_V=33.2-18.0*log W_0, and the determination seems free of systematic
effects. The root mean square error of the fitting is 0.6 magnitudes. This
error is mostly accounted for by measurement errors and intrinsic variability
of W_0, but in addition a possible dependence on the metallicity is found,
which becomes clearly noticeable for metallicities below [Fe/H]=-0.4. This
detection is possible because in our sample [Fe/H] ranges from -1.5 to 0.4. The
Wilson--Bappu effect can be used confidently for all metallicities not lower
than -0.4, including the LMC. While it does not provide accurate distances to
single stars, it is a useful tool to determine accurate distances to clusters
and aggregates, where a sufficient number of stars can be observed. We apply
the Wilson--Bappu effect to published data of the open cluster M67; the
retrieved distance modulus is of 9.65 magnitude, in very good agreement with
the best distance estimations for this cluster, based on main sequence fitting.

galaxy potential. These forces disturb the satellite, producing asymmetries in
its stellar distribution, tidal tail formation, and modifications of the
velocity dispersions profiles. Most of these features are observed in the Ursa
Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which is one of the closest satellites of
the Milky Way. These features show that UMi is been tidally disrupted and
probably not in virial equilibrium. The high velocity dispersion of UMi could
also be a reflection of this tidal disruption and not the signature of the
large dark matter content that would be deduced if virial equilibrium is
assumed. In order to avoid the uncertainty produced when virial equilibrium is
assumed in systems in strong tidal fields, we present a new method of
calculating the mass-to-luminosity ratio of disrupted dwarf galaxies. This
method is based on numerical simulations and only takes into account the shape
of the dwarf density profile and the tidal tail brightness, but does not depend
on the kinematics of the dwarf. Applying this method to UMi, we obtain a
mass-to-luminosity relation of 12, which is lower than the value obtained
assuming virial equilibrium (M/L=60). In addition, if UMi has a large
dark-matter content, it will be impossible to reproduce a tidal tail as
luminous as the one observed.

time dependent gas velocity field resulting from 3D N-body sticky-particle
simulations of a galaxy. The modeled clouds are affected by the ram pressure
due to their rapid motion through the ICM in the central part of a cluster.
Numerical simulations have shown that after the initial compression phase due
to ram pressure a process of gas re-accretion onto the galactic disk takes
place. We find that the gas re-accretion leads to an increase of the total
magnetic energy without any dynamo action. The simulated magnetic fields are
used to construct the model maps of high-frequency (Faraday rotation-free)
polarized radio emission. We show that the evolution of the polarized intensity
shows features that are characteristic for different evolutionary stages of an
ICM-ISM interaction. The comparison of polarized radio continuum emission maps
with our model permits to determine whether the galaxy is in the compression or
in the re-accretion phase. It also provides an important constraint upon the
dynamical modeling of an ICM-ISM interactions.

primordial star-forming clouds in a Lambda CDM universe, by following the
formation of dark matter halos and the cooling of gas within them. To model the
physics of chemically pristine gas, we employ a non-equilibrium treatment of
the chemistry of 9 species and include cooling by molecular hydrogen. We
explore the hierarchical growth of bound structures forming at redshifts z = 25
- 30 with total masses in the range 10^5 - 10^6 Msun. The complex interplay
between the gravitational formation of dark halos and the thermodynamic and
chemical evolution of the gas clouds compromises analytic estimates of the
critical H2 fraction. Dynamical heating from mass accretion and mergers opposes
relatively inefficient cooling by molecular hydrogen, delaying the production
of star-forming clouds in rapidly growing halos. We also investigate the impact
of photo-dissociating ultra-violet (UV) radiation on the formation of
primordial gas clouds. We consider two extreme cases by first including a
uniform radiation field in the optically thin limit and secondly by accounting
for the maximum effect of gas self-shielding in virialized regions. In both the
cases we consider, the overall impact can be described by computing an
equilibrium H2 abundance for the radiation flux and defining an effective
shielding factor.
  Based on our numerical results, we develop a semi-analytic model of the
formation of the first stars, and demonstrate how it can be coupled with large
N-body simulations to predict the star formation rate in the early universe.

by the scaling of $\Delta s/Q^2$ with $\epsilon=1-T/T_c$, where $\Delta s$ is
the excess entropy and $Q$ is the order parameter. As $\Delta s$ is obtained by
integration of the experimental excess specific heat of the transition $\Delta
c$, it displays little experimental noise so that the curve $\log(\Delta
s/Q^2)$ versus $\log\epsilon$ is better constrained than, say, $\log\Delta c$
versus $\log\epsilon$. The behaviour of $\Delta s/Q^2$ for different
universality classes is presented and compared. In all cases, it clearly
deviates from being a constant. The determination of this function can then be
an effective method to distinguish asymptotic critical behaviour. For
comparison, experimental data for three very different systems, Rb2CoF4,
Rb2ZnCl4 and SrTiO3, are analysed under this approach. In SrTiO3, the function
$\Delta s/Q^2$ does not deviate within experimental resolution from a straight
line so that, although Q can be fitted with a non mean-field exponent, the data
can be explained by a classical Landau mean-field behaviour. In contrast, the
behaviour of $\Delta s/Q^2$ for the antiferromagnetic transition in Rb2CoF4 and
the normal-incommensurate phase transition in Rb2ZCl4 is fully consistent with
the asymptotic critical behaviour of the universality class corresponding to
each case. This analysis supports, therefore, the claim that incommensurate
phase transitions in general, and the A$_2$BX$_4$ compounds in particular, in
contrast with most structural phase transitions, have critical regions large
enough to be observable.

First, I study its connection to quantum field theory and show that the
spectrum of such systems cannot be reduced in general to the one of a single
constant effective mass matrix. Choosing nevertheless to work in this customary
formalism, one then faces several ways to diagonalize a complex matrix, which
lead to different eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Last, and it is the main
subject of this work, because K0 and its charge conjugate K0bar are also
connected, in quantum field theory, by hermitian conjugation, any constant
effective mass matrix is defined, in this basis, up to arbitrary diagonal
antisymmetric terms; I use this freedom to deform the mass matrix in various
ways and study the consequences on its spectrum. Emphasis is put on the role of
discrete symmetries throughout the paper. That the degeneracy of the
eigenvalues of the full renormalized mass matrix can be a sufficient condition
for the outcome of CP violation is outlined in an appendix. In the whole work,
the dual formalism of |in> and <out| states and bi-orthogonal basis, suitable
for non-normal matrices, is used.

extent to which data from the diffractive interaction mechanism may be
described by a factorized formula which is the product of a universal term
describing the probability of finding a Pomeron in a proton (loosely referred
to as the ""Pomeron flux-factor"") and a term decribing the Pomeron's interaction
with the other incident proton. In the present paper, after demonstrating that
existing data on diffractive gamma*-p and pbar-p interactions show that the
Pomeron flux-factor is not universal, we present the results of a new test of
factorization in these interactions which does not rely on universality of the
flux-factor. The test is satisfied to within ~20% for 1 < Q^2 ~ 6 GeV^2 and
beta < 0.2 in the gamma*-p interactions, suggesting that the resons for
non-universality of the flux-factor have a limited effect on the factorization
itself. However, a clear breakdown of this test is observed at larger Q^2.
Kharzeev and Levin suggest that this can be attributed to the onset of QCD
evolution effects in the Pomeron's structure. The breakdown occurs in a Q^2
region which agrees with their estimates of a small Pomeron size.

decomposition of the set of arcs on $U$, described later on. We give two new

$f \in {\mathcal{O}}_{U}$ such that $ord_{E_\alpha}(f)<ord_{E_\beta}(f)$, where
$E_\alpha, E_\beta$ are exceptional divisors of the desingularisation, then
$\bar{N_\alpha}\not \subset \bar{N_\beta}$. The second condition, used when the
singularity is rational and of surface, is the following:let $(S,s)$ et
$(S',s')$ be two rational surface singularities so that there exist a dominant
and birational morphism $\pi$ from $(S,s)$ to $(S',s')$;then,let $E_\alpha,

simple, but it allows us to prove quite directly the conjecture for the

  mappings from ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ to ${\mathbb{R}}$","34 pages, 10 figures",,,,"math.FA math.GN",,"  We study two questions posed by Johnson, Lindenstrauss, Preiss, and
Schechtman, concerning the structure of level sets of uniform and Lipschitz
quotient maps from $R^n\to R$. We show that if $f:R^n\to R$, $n\geq 2$, is a
uniform quotient map then for every $t\in R$, $f^{-1}(t)$ has a bounded number
of components, each component of $f^{-1}(t)$ separates $R^n$ and the upper
bound of the number of components depends only on $n$ and the moduli of
co-uniform and uniform continuity of $f$. Next we obtain a characterization of
the form of any closed, hereditarily locally connected, locally compact,
connected set with no end points and containing no simple closed curve, and we
apply it to describe the structure of level sets of co-Lipschitz uniformly
continuous mappings $f:R^2\to R$. We prove that all level sets of any
co-Lipschitz uniformly continuous map from $R^2$ to $R$ are locally connected,
and we show that for every pair of a constant $c>0$ and a function $\Omega$
with $\lim_{r\to 0}\Omega(r)=0$, there exists a natural number $M=M(c,\Omega)$,
so that for every co-Lipschitz uniformly continuous map $f:R^2\to R$ with a
co-Lipschitz constant $c$ and a modulus of uniform continuity $\Omega$, there
exists a natural number $n(f)\le M$ and a finite set $T_f\subset R$ with
$\card(T_f)\leq n(f)-1$ so that for all $t\in R\setminus T_f$, $f^{-1}(t)$ has
exactly $n(f)$ components, $R^2\setminus f^{-1}(t)$ has exactly $n(f)+1$
components and each component of $f^{-1}(t)$ is homeomorphic with the real line
and separates the plane into exactly 2 components. The number and form of
components of $f^{-1}(s)$ for $s\in T_f$ are also described - they have a
finite graph structure. We give an example of a uniform quotient map from
$R^2\to R$ which has non-locally connected level sets.

expanding gas due to shear viscosity. With this modified distribution function
I estimate viscous corrections to spectra, elliptic flow, and HBT radii in
hydrodynamic simulations of heavy ion collisions using the blast wave model.
For reasonable values of the shear viscosity, viscous corrections become of
order one when the transverse momentum of the particle is larger than 1.7 GeV.
This places a bound on the $p_{T}$ range accessible to hydrodynamics for this
observable. Shear corrections to elliptic flow cause $v_{2}(p_{T})$ to veer
below the ideal results for $p_{T} \approx 0.9$ GeV. Shear corrections to the
longitudinal HBT radius $R^{2}_{L}$ are large and negative. The reduction of
$R_{L}^2$ can be traced to the reduction of the longitudinal pressure. Viscous
corrections cause the longitudinal radius to deviate from the
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{m_T}}$ scaling which is observed in the data and which is
predicted by ideal hydrodynamics. The correction to the sideward radius
$R^{2}_{S}$ is small. The correction to the outward radius $R^{2}_{O}$ is also
negative and tends to make $R_{O}/R_{S} \approx 1$.

"quant-ph/0301172","Danilo Mauro","D. Mauro","Topics in Koopman-von Neumann Theory","179 pages, Latex, Ph.D. Thesis",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In this thesis we study several features of the operatorial approach to
classical mechanics pionereed by Koopman and von Neumann (KvN) in the Thirties.
In particular in the first part we study the role of the phases of the KvN
states. We analyze, within the KvN theory, the two-slit experiment and the
Aharonov-Bohm effect and we make a comparison between the classical and the
quantum case. In the second part of the thesis we study the extension of the
KvN formalism to the space of forms and Jacobi fields. We first show that all
the standard Cartan calculus on symplectic spaces can be performed via
Grassmann variables or via suitable combinations of Pauli matrices. Second we
study the extended Hilbert space of KvN which now includes forms and prove that
it is impossible to have at the same time a positive definite scalar product
and a unitary evolution. Clear physical reasons for this phenomenon are
exhibited. We conclude the thesis with some work in progress on the issue of
quantization.

spherical manifold and discreteness in quantum evolution. As a system evolves
in time the state vector changes and it traces out a curve in Hilbert space.
Geometrically, the evolution is represented as a closed curve in the projective
Hilbert space. In recent times many attempts have been made to describe
'length', 'distance', and 'geometric phases' and also 'parallel transport'and
symplectic geometry in various ways in the projective Hilbert space, during
quantum evolution. It is shown in this paper that for the quantum evolution in
ray space, spherical manifold and features of discreteness can be described
geometrically.

operations and classical communication (SLOCC) for fixed numbers of qubits. We
explicitly exhibit the homomorphism between complex and real groups for
two-qubits, and use the latter to describe the effect of SLOCC operations on
two-qubit states. We find an expression for the polarization Lorentz group
invariant length, which is the Minkowskian analog of the quantum state purity,
the corresponding Euclidean length. The construction presented is immediately
generalizable to any finite number of qubits.

the transformation covariant for rotation of the phases. The optimal cloning
maps are derived without simplifying assumptions from first principles, for any
number of input and output qubits, and for a single input qutrit and any number
of output qutrits. We also compare the cloning maps for global and single
particle fidelities, and we show that the two criteria lead to different
optimal maps.

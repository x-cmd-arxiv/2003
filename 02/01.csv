appeared featureless. In UVCS data the events were seen as 4-13 deg wide
enhancements of the strongest coronal lines HI Ly-alpha and OVI (1032,1037 A).
We derived electron densities for several of the events from the Large Angle
Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) C2 white light observations. They are
comparable to or smaller than densities inferred for other CMEs. We modeled the
observable properties of examples of the structured (1999 April 15) and
unstructured (1999 May 9) narrow CMEs at different heights in the corona
between 1.5 and 2 R(Sun). The derived electron temperatures, densities and
outflow speeds are similar for those two types of ejections. They were compared
with properties of polar coronal jets and other CMEs. We discuss different
scenarios of narrow CME formation either as a jet formed by reconnection onto
open field lines or CME ejected by expansion of closed field structures.
Overall, we conclude that the existing observations do not definitively place
the narrow CMEs into the jet or the CME picture, but the acceleration of the
1999 April 15 event resembles acceleration seen in many CMEs, rather than
constant speeds or deceleration observed in jets.

stellar tails) to the west of the system, 3) the very extended HI tail to the
west and north of NGC 7714, and 4) the partial stellar ring in NGC 7714. Our
simulations confirm the results of earlier work that an off-center inclined
collision between two disk galaxies is almost certainly responsible for the
peculiar morphologies of this system. However, we have explored a wider set of
initial galaxy and collisional encounter parameters than previously, and have
found a relatively narrow range of parameters that reproduce all the major
morphologies of this system. The simulations suggest specific mechanisms for
the development of several unusual structures. We find that the complex gas
bridge has up to four distinct components, with gas contributed from two sides
of NGC 7715, as well as from NGC 7714. The observed gas-star offset in this
bridge is accounted for in the simulations by the dissipative evolution of the
gas. The models also indicate that the low surface brightness HI tail to the
far west of NGC 7714 is the end of the NGC 7715 countertail, curved behind the
two galaxies. Spectral evolutionary models of the NGC 7714 core by Lan\c{c}on

interstellar medium (ISM) accelerate CR is still popular one but a number of
authors have drawn attention to the fact that the experimental evidence for the
presence of gamma rays from the expected interaction of CR with gas in the
remnant is poor. Indeed, it is claimed that many SNR are not `seen' in GeV or
TeV gamma rays, whereas `they should have been'.
  We have looked at this problem and we conclude that the idea of CR production
in SNR cannot be faulted in this way, if the evacuation of ambient gas by the
stellar wind of the progenitor star and, frequently, by associated earlier
close-by SN, is taken into account; such phenomena are expected for the
important Type II SN which result from very massive stars.
  Other SNR have, apparently, been seen and the interaction of SNR-accelerated
particles with adjacent molecular clouds has been deemed responsible. However,
we worry about this interpretation because of the slow progress of the SNR
shock through such clouds, although electron-effects may, indeed, contribute.
  This paper is devoted mainly to the visibility of nearby SNR in gamma rays
although many of the arguments also relate to remote SNR. For the nearby SNR
another problem enters the scene: the large angular spread of the remnant. It
is especially important for the old SNR, where cosmic rays have already
diffused to a large distance from the SNR center. We have also examined the
effect of the 'anomalous diffusion' of CR propagation in the non-homogeneous
interstellar medium on the visibility of SNR for gamma rays of different
energies.

field galaxy populations at comparable redshifts and magnitudes, and indicate
at most a mild luminosity evolution out to z ~ 1.5 - 2. GRB optical afterglows
seen in absorption provide a powerful new probe of the ISM in dense, central
regions of their host galaxies, complementary to the traditional studies using
QSO absorbers. Some GRB hosts are heavily obscured, and provide a new way to
select a population of cosmological sub-mm sources, and a novel constraint on
the total obscured fraction of star formation over the history of the universe.
Finally, detection of GRB afterglows at z > 6 may provide a unique way to probe
the primordial star formation, massive IMF, early IGM, and chemical enrichment
at the end of the cosmic reionization era.

fraction in galaxy-sized dark matter halos via anomalous flux ratios in lensed
images. The flux ratios, however, can be affected by both the substructure in
the lens halo and by isolated small-mass halos along the entire line-of-sight
to the lensed source. While lensing by dark matter clumps near the lens galaxy
is more efficient than elsewhere, the cumulative effect of all objects along
the line-of-sight could be significant. Here we estimate the potential
contribution of isolated clumps to the substructure lensing signal using a
simple model motivated by cosmological simulations. We find that the
contribution of isolated clumps to the total lensing optical depth ranges from
a few to tens percent, depending on assumptions and the particular
configuration of the lens. Therefore, although the contribution of isolated
clumps to the lensing signal is not dominant, it should not be neglected in
detailed analyses of substructure lensing. For the currently favored Lambda-CDM
model, the total calculated optical depth for lensing is high, tau ~ 0.2-20 and
could, therefore, naturally explain the high frequency of anomalous flux ratios
in observed lenses. The prediction, however, is highly sensitive to the spatial
distribution of substructure halos in the innermost regions of the lens halo,
which is still very uncertain. Therefore, constraints on the properties of the
substructure population or accurate cosmological constraints, such as the mass
of the warm dark matter particle, are difficult if not impossible to derive at
this point.

form of weighted linear sum of pairwise contacts. However, these potentials
have been shown to be unsuitable choices because they cannot stabilize native
proteins against a large number of decoys generated by gapless threading. We
develop an alternative framework for designing protein potential. We describe
how finding optimal protein potential can be understood from two geometric
viewpoints, and we derive nonlinear potentials using mixture of Gaussian kernel
functions for folding and design. The optimization criterion for obtaining
parameters of the potential is to minimize bounds on the generalization error
of discriminating protein structures and decoys not used in training. In our
experiment we use a training set of 440 protein structures repre senting a
major portion of all known protein structures, and about 14 million structure
decoys and sequence decoys obtained by gapless threading. We succeeded in
obtaining nonlinear potential with perfect discrimination of the 440 native
structures and native sequences. For the more challenging task of sequence
design when decoys are obtained by gapless threading, we show that there is no
linear potential with perfect discrimination of all 440 native sequences.

accomodate spatial anisotropies and the coupled evolution of several fields,

we derive generalized fluctuation--dissipation conditions on the form of the
(non-linear) equations for the realization of a Gaussian probability density of
the fields in the steady state. For the amorphous growth of a single height
field in one dimension we give a general class of equations with exactly
calculable (Gaussian and more complicated) steady states. In two dimensions, we
show that any anisotropic system evolves on long time and length scales either
to the usual isotropic strong coupling regime or to a linear-like fixed point
associated with a hidden symmetry. Similar results are derived for textural
growth equations that couple the height field with additional order parameters
which fluctuate on the growing surface. In this context, we propose
phenomenological equations for the growth of a crystalline material, where the
height field interacts with lattice distortions, and identify two special cases
that obtain Gaussian steady states. In the first case compression modes
influence growth and are advected by height fluctuations, while in the second
case it is the density of dislocations that couples with the height.

(i.e. Model RB/RD) for which we can establish the existence of phase
transitions and identify the threshold points exactly. By encoding CSPs into
CNF formulas, it is proved that almost all instances of Model RB/RD have no
tree-like resolution proofs of less than exponential size. Thus, we not only
introduce new families of CNF formulas hard for resolution, which is a central
task of Proof-Complexity theory, but also propose models with both many hard
instances and exact phase transitions. Then, the implications of such models
are addressed. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that an
application of Model RB/RD might be in the generation of hard satisfiable
instances, which is not only of practical importance but also related to some
open problems in cryptography such as generating one-way functions.
Subsequently, a further theoretical support for the generation method is shown
by establishing exponential lower bounds on the complexity of solving random
satisfiable and forced satisfiable instances of RB/RD near the threshold.
Finally, conclusions are presented, as well as a detailed comparison of Model
RB/RD with the Hamiltonian cycle problem and random 3-SAT, which, respectively,
exhibit three different kinds of phase transition behavior in NP-complete
problems.

wondered if the Babylonian planetary tables might have played a role in the

polarization current whose distribution pattern rotates (with an angular
frequency $\omega$) and oscillates (with a frequency $\Omega $) at the same
time, and which comprises both poloidal and toroidal components. This type of
polarization current is found in recent practical machines designed to
investigate superluminal emission. We find that the superluminal motion of the
distribution pattern of the emitting current generates localized
electromagnetic waves that do not decay spherically, i.e. that do not have an
intensity diminishing like ${R_P}^{-2}$ with the distance $R_P$ from their
source. The nonspherical decay of the focused wave packets that are emitted by
the polarization currents does not contravene conservation of energy: the
constructive interference of the constituent waves of such propagating caustics
takes place within different solid angles on spheres of different radii ($R_P$)
centred on the source. For a polarization current whose longitudinal
distribution (over an azimuthal interval of length $2\pi$) consists of $m$
cycles of a sinusoidal wave train, the nonspherically decaying part of the
emitted radiation contains the frequencies $\Omega \pm m\omega$; i.e. it
contains {\it only} the frequencies involved in the creation and implementation
of the source. This is in contrast to recent studies of the spherically
decaying emission, which was shown to contain much higher frequencies. The
polarization of the emitted radiation is found to be linear for most
configurations of the source.

with the number of steps in the walk, as the particle is becoming more
delocalised with each step. However, the effect of a small amount of
decoherence can be to enhance the properties of the quantum walk that are
desirable for the development of quantum algorithms, such as fast mixing times

some questions related to what can and cannot be said about the history of a
quantum mechanical system. Relying heavily on the weak- measurement formalism
of Aharonov and coworkers, I argue that there is much to be learned about a
system based both on its preparation and on subsequent postselection. This is
illustrated with examples from a number of past, present, and future
experiments from our lab, ranging from tests of quantum ""paradoxes"" to studies
of nonlocality to non-deterministic implementations of logic operations on
quantum information. The connection between weak measurements and generalized
probability theory is discussed, along with some of the counterintuitive
features of these ""probabilities."" Conclusions are for the most part left to
the reader.

and a conducting or dielectric boundary. Its original computation was in terms
of the Lamb shift of the atomic ground state in an electromagnetic field (EMF)
modified by boundary conditions along the wall and assuming a stationary atom.
We calculate the corrections to this force due to a moving atom, demanding
maximal preservation of entanglement generated by the moving atom-conducting
wall system. We do this by using non-perturbative path integral techniques
which allow for coherent back-action and thus can treat non-Markovian
processes. We recompute the atom-wall force for a conducting boundary by
allowing the bare atom-EMF ground state to evolve (or self-dress) into the
interacting ground state. We find a clear distinction between the cases of
stationary and adiabatic motions. Our result for the retardation correction for
adiabatic motion is up to twice as much as that computed for stationary atoms.
We give physical interpretations of both the stationary and adiabatic atom-wall
forces in terms of alteration of the virtual photon cloud surrounding the atom
by the wall and the Doppler effect.

A 67, 052310 (2003)","10.1103/PhysRevA.67.052310",,"quant-ph",,"  We show that quantum feedback control can be used as a quantum error
correction process for errors induced by weak continuous measurement. In
particular, when the error model is restricted to one, perfectly measured,
error channel per physical qubit, quantum feedback can act to perfectly protect
a stabilizer codespace. Using the stabilizer formalism we derive an explicit
scheme, involving feedback and an additional constant Hamiltonian, to protect
an ($n-1$)-qubit logical state encoded in $n$ physical qubits. This works for
both Poisson (jump) and white-noise (diffusion) measurement processes. In
addition, universal quantum computation is possible in this scheme. As an
example, we show that detected-spontaneous emission error correction with a
driving Hamiltonian can greatly reduce the amount of redundancy required to
protect a state from that which has been previously postulated [e.g., Alber
\emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 4402 (2001)].

GRB010214 with BeppoSAX. The prompt emission shows possible evidence of
variable absorption from N_H = 3.0^{+5.1}_{-2.0} x 10^23 cm-2 in the first 6 s
of the event to a value consistent with the Galactic column density (N_H^(G) =
2.66 x 10^20 cm-2) in the GRB direction. An X-ray afterglow emission in the
2-10 keV energy band was detected with BeppoSAX, but an analogue search at
lower wavelengths (optical, IR and radio) was unsuccessful. The X-ray afterglow
spectrum is consistent with a power-law with Galactic absorption. The light
curve shows a complex decay, if the tail of the prompt emission is assumed as
the onset of the afterglow: if the origin of the afterglow is coincident with
the GRB onset, a bump before ~ 3 x 10^4 s is inferred, while if the afterglow
is assumed to start later, a steepening of the power-law light curve at t ~ 3 x
10^4 s is deduced. We discuss these results in the light of the current models
of afterglows and the possible origin of the GRB darkness. Finally, we
tentatively derive an estimate of the burst redshift.

affected by some kinds of the dark matter (or the so-called ""dark energy"")
uniformly distributed in space, and therefore should be accompanied by some
residual Hubble expansion at any spatial scales, particularly, in the
Earth-Moon system. The ""local"" Hubble expansion can be revealed by comparing
the rate of increase in the lunar semi-major axis measured by LLR (which should
be produced both by the well-known tidal exchange of angular momentum between
the Earth and Moon and the local Hubble expansion) with the same quantity
derived indirectly from astrometric data on the Earth's rotation deceleration
(which is produced only by the tidal interaction). Such analysis really points
to the discrepancy 1.3 cm/yr, which corresponds to the local Hubble constant
H_0^(loc) = 33 +/- 5 (km/s)/Mpc. This value is about two times less than at
intergalactic scales but many orders of magnitude greater than was predicted in

compensate the action of the space-time derivatives. A generalized Lorentz
force can be derived from the classical Hamilton equations associated with this
evolution function. We show that the fifth (scalar) field can be eliminated
through the introduction of a conformal metric on the spacetime manifold. The
geodesic equation associated with this metric coincides with the Lorentz force,
and is therefore dynamically equivalent. Since the generalized Maxwell
equations for the five dimensional fields provide an equation relating the
fifth field with the spacetime density of events, one can derive the spacetime
event density associated with the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solution of the
Einstein equations. The resulting density, in the conformal coordinate space,
is isotropic and homogeneous, decreasing as the square of the Robertson-Walker
scale factor. Using the Einstein equations, one sees that both for the static
and matter dominated models, the conformal time slice in which the events which
generate the world lines are contained becomes progressively thinner as the
inverse square of the scale factor, establishing a simple correspondence
between the configurations predicted by the underlying
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker dynamical model and the configurations in the
conformal coordinates.

Coriolis forcing, $U_t + U\cdot\nabla_x U = 2k U^\perp$, with a fixed $2k$
being the inverse Rossby number. We ask whether the action of dispersive
rotational forcing alone, $U^\perp$, prevents the generic finite time breakdown
of the free nonlinear convection. The answer provided in this work is a
conditional yes. Namely, we show that the rotating Euler equations admit global
smooth solutions for a subset of generic initial configurations. With other
configurations, however, finite time breakdown of solutions may and actually
does occur. Thus, global regularity depends on whether the initial
configuration crosses an intrinsic, ${\mathcal O}(1)$ critical threshold, which
is quantified in terms of the initial vorticity, $\omega_0=\nabla \times U_0$,
and the initial spectral gap associated with the $2\times 2$ initial velocity
gradient, $\eta_0:=\lambda_2(0)-\lambda_1(0), \lambda_j(0)= \lambda_j(\nabla
U_0)$. Specifically, global regularity of the rotational Euler equation is
ensured if and only if $4k \omega_0(\alpha) +\eta^2_0(\alpha) <4k^2, \forall
\alpha \in \R^2$ . We also prove that the velocity field remains smooth if and
only if it is periodic. We observe yet another remarkable periodic behavior
exhibited by the {\em gradient} of the velocity field. The spectral dynamics of
the Eulerian formulation reveals that the vorticity and the eigenvalues (and
hence the divergence) of the flow evolve with their own path-dependent period.
We conclude with a kinetic formulation of the rotating Euler equation.

energies can be defined for a proton in the combined nuclear-Coulomb potential,
including also the target potential, in the case in which the proton is bound
in a nucleus which is partner of a nuclear reaction. Using such effective
parameters the proton behaves similarly to a neutron. In this way some
unexpected results obtained from dynamical calculations for reactions initiated
by very weakly bound proton halo nuclei can be interpreted. Namely the fact
that stripping dominates the nuclear breakup cross section which in turn
dominates over the Coulomb breakup even when the target is heavy at medium to
high incident energies. Our interpretation helps also clarifying why the
existence and characteristics of a proton halo extracted from different types
of data have sometimes appeared contradictory.

massless pions in $d+Au$ reactions at $\sqrt{s}_{NN}=200$ GeV at RHIC is
computed in the framework of pQCD multiple elastic scattering on a nuclear
target. We introduce a formalism to incorporate initial state energy loss in
perturbative calculations and take into account the elastic energy loss in
addition to the transverse momentum broadening of partons.We argue that the
centrality dependence of the Cronin effect can distinguish between different
hadron production scenarios at RHIC. Its magnitude and rapidity dependence are
shown to carry important experimental information about the properties of cold
nuclear matter up to the moderate- and large-$x$ antishadowing/EMC regions.

greatly limited by the technical inability to measure data over a wide spectral
range. Data inversion for real and imaginary part of $\chi^{n}(n\omega; \omega,
>... ,\omega)$ can be more efficiently performed if the knowledge of one of the
two parts of the susceptibility in a finite spectral range is supplemented with
a single measurement of the other part for a given frequency. Then it is
possible to perform data inversion using only measured data and subtractive K-K
relations. In this paper multiply subtractive K-K relations are, for the first
time, presented for the nonlinear harmonic generation susceptibilities. The
applicability of the singly subtractive K-K relations are shown using data for
third-order harmonic generation susceptibility of polysilane.

based on canonical and other transformations is used to reduce the path
integral for this potential into a path integral for the Morse potential
problem. The dimensional extension technique is seen to be essential for
performing the multiple integral representation of the propagator. The
correctly normalized scattering wave functions and the scattering function are
derived. To test the method employed, the free particle and the $\delta

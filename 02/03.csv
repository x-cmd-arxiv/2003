  Stars","Accepted for publication in the ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We have used the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) to conduct a
snap-shot survey of O VI variability in the winds of 66 OB-type stars in the
Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. These time series consist of two or three
observations separated by intervals ranging from a few days to several months.
Although these time series provide the bare minimum of information required to
detect variations, this survey demonstrates that the O VI doublet in the winds
of OB-type stars is variable on various scales both in time and velocity. For
spectral types from O3 to B1, 64% vary in time. At spectral types later than
B1, no wind variability is observed. This fraction represents a lower limit on
the true incidence of variability in the O VI wind lines, which is very common
and probably ubiquitous. The observed variations extend over several hundreds
of km/s of the wind profile and can be strong. The width over which the wind O
VI profile varies is only weakly correlated with the terminal velocity (\vinf),
but a significant correlation (close to a 1:1 relationship) is derived between
the maximum velocity of the variation and \vinf. High velocity O VI wind
absorption features (possibly related to the discrete absorption components
seen in other wind lines) are also observed in 46% of the cases for spectral
types from O3 to B0.5. These features are variable, but the nature of their
propagation cannot be determined from this survey. If X-rays can produce
sufficient O VI by Auger ionization of O VI, and the X-rays originate from
strong shocks in the wind, this study suggests that stronger shocks occur more
frequently near \vinf, causing an enhancement of O VI near \vinf.

component is increasingly important for high sensitivity CMB experiments. We
use the recently published \ha data of both the northern and southern skies as
the basis for such a template.
  The first step is to correct the \ha maps for dust absorption using the 100
$\mu$m dust maps of Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998). We show that for a
range of longitudes, the Galactic latitude distribution of absorption suggests
that it is 33 per cent of the full extragalactic absorption. A reliable
absorption-corrected \ha map can be produced for $\sim 95$ per cent of the sky;
the area for which a template cannot be recovered is the Galactic plane area
$|b| < 5^{\circ}$, $l=260^{\circ}-0^{\circ}-160^{\circ}$ and some isolated
dense dust clouds at intermediate latitudes.
  The second step is to convert the dust-corrected \ha data into a predicted
radio surface brightness. The free-free emission formula is revised to give an
accurate expression (1 per cent) for the radio emission covering the frequency
range 100 MHz to 100 GHz and the electron temperature range 3000 to 20000 K.
The main uncertainty when applying this expression is the variation of electron
temperature across the sky. The emission formula is verified in several
extended H{\sc ii} regions using data in the range 408 to 2326 MHz.
  A full-sky free-free template map is presented at 30 GHz; the scaling to
other frequencies is given. The Haslam et al. all-sky 408 MHz map of the sky
can be corrected for this free-free component, which amounts to a $\approx 6$
per cent correction at intermediate and high latitudes....

in an oscillator potential. The quantum mechanics of many anyons is complicated
due to the occurrence of multivalued wavefunctions. Nevertheless there exists,
for arbitrary number of anyons, a subset of exact solutions which may be
interpreted as the breathing modes or equivalently collective modes of the full
system. Choosing the three-anyon system as an example, we also discuss the
anatomy of the so called ``missing'' states which are in fact known numerically
and are set apart from the known exact states by their nonlinear dependence on
the statistical parameter in the spectrum.
  Though classically the equations of motion remains unchanged in the presence
of the statistical interaction, the system is non-integrable because the
configuration space is now multiply connected. In fact we show that even though
the number of constants of motion is the same as the number of degrees of
freedom the system is in general not integrable via action-angle variables.
This is probably the first known example of a many body pseudo-integrable
system. We discuss the classification of the orbits and the symmetry reduction
due to the interaction. We also sketch the application of periodic orbit theory
(POT) to many anyon systems and show the presence of eigenvalues that are
potentially non-linear as a function of the statistical parameter. Finally we
perform the semiclassical analysis of the ground state by minimizing the
Hamiltonian with fixed angular momentum and further minimization over the
quantized values of the angular momentum.

that for a general (rational) number of electrons per site $n$ there are three
regimes, depending on the relative strength $V$ of the long--range Coulomb
interaction (as compared to the hopping amplitude $t$). For very large $V$ the
quantum ground state differs little from Hubbard's classical solution, for
intermediate to large values of $V$ we recover essentially the Wigner crystal
of the continuum model, and for small $V$ the charge modulation amounts to a
small--amplitude charge--density wave. We then include the spin degrees of
freedom and show that in the Wigner crystal regimes (i.e. for large $V$) they
are coupled by an antiferromagnetic kinetic exchange $J$, which turns out to be
smaller than the energy scale governing the charge degrees of freedom. Our
results shed new light on the insulating phases of organic quasi--1D compounds

  for a special issue",,"10.1088/0305-4470/36/35/319",,"cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.supr-con",,"  We introduce a Hubbard model on a particular class of geometries, and
consider the effect of doping the highly spin-degenerate Mott-insulating state
with a microscopic number of holes in the extreme strong-coupling limit. The
geometry is quite general, with pairs of atomic sites at each superlattice
vertex, and a highly frustrated inter-atomic connectivity: the one dimensional
realization is a chain of edge-sharing tetrahedra. The sole model parameter is
the ratio of intra-pair to inter-pair hopping matrix elements. If the
intra-pair hopping is negligible then introducing a microscopic number of holes
results in a ferromagnetic Nagaoka groundstate. Conversely, if the intra-pair
hopping is comparable with the inter-pair hopping then the groundstate is low
spin with short-ranged spin correlations. We exactly solve the correlated
motion of a pair of holes in such a state and find that, in 1-d and 2-d, they
form a bound pair on a length scale that increases with diminishing binding
energy. This result is pertinent to the long-standing problem of hole motion in
the copper-oxide planes of the high-temperature superconductors: we have
rigorously shown that, on our frustrated geometry, the holes pair up and a
short-ranged low-spin state is generated by hole motion alone.

investigated with respect to several biologically relevant configurations, more
specifically the position of the cells along the input space and the spatial
distribution of their connections. First we put the asymmetric Hopfield model
onto a scale-free Barabasi-Albert network. Then, a geometrical diluted
architecture, which maps from L-bit input patterns into $N$-neurons networks,
with R=N/L<1 (we adopt R=0.1, 0.2 and 0.3), is considered. The distribution of
the connections between cells along the one-dimensional input space follows a
normal distribution centered at each cell, in the sense that cells that are
closer to each other have increased probability to interconnect. The models
also explicitly consider the placement of the neuronal cells along the input
space in such a way that denser regions of that space tend to become denser,
therefore implementing a special case of the Barabasi-Albert connecting scheme.
The obtained results indicate that, for the case of the considered stimuli and
noise, the network performance increases with the spatial uniformity of cell
distribution.

about the shape of these barrier trees, in particular about balance and

investigate the structure of subtrees of the barrier trees. We conclude that at
least one of the used statistics is capable of distinguishing different types

distribution function F, with compact support, based on the theory of IFSs. The
estimator of F is tought as the fixed point of a contractive operator T defined
in terms of a vector of parameters p and a family of affine maps W which can be
both depend of the sample (X_1, X_2, ...., X_n). Given W, the problem consists
in finding a vector p such that the fixed point of T is ``sufficiently near''
to F. It turns out that this is a quadratic constrained optimization problem
that we propose to solve by penalization techniques. If F has a density f, we
can also provide an estimator of f based on Fourier techniques. IFS estimators
for F are asymptotically equivalent to the empirical distribution function
(e.d.f.) estimator. We will study relative efficiency of the IFS estimators
with respect to the e.d.f. for small samples via Monte Carlo approach.
  For well behaved distribution functions F and for a particular family of
so-called wavelet maps the IFS estimators can be dramatically better than the
e.d.f. (or the kernel estimator for density estimation) in presence of missing
data, i.e. when it is only possibile to observe data on subsets of the whole
support of F.

Collaboration. Using the total multiplicity $N_{\rm ch} = \int (dN_{\rm

ch})^{-1}dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta = dn/d\eta$ with different centrality cuts at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 130 GeV and 200 GeV, respectively. To explain these scaling
behaviors of $dn/d\eta$, we consider the stochastic approach named the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with two sources. The following Fokker-Planck
equation is adopted for the present analyses, $$ \frac{\partial
P(x,t)}{\partial t} = \gamma [\frac{\partial}{\partial x}x + \frac
12\frac{\sigma^2}{\gamma}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}] P(x, t) $$ where $x$
means the rapidity (y) or pseudo-rapidity ($\eta$). $t$, $\gamma$ and
$\sigma^2$ are the evolution parameter, the frictional coefficient and the
variance, respectively. Introducing a variable of $z_r = \eta/\eta_{\rm rms}$
($\eta_{\rm rms}=\sqrt{< \eta^2 >}$) we explain the $dn/d z_r$ distributions in
the present approach. Moreover, to explain the rapidity (y) distributions from
$\eta$ distributions at 200 GeV, we have derived the formula as $$
\frac{dn}{dy}=J^{-1}\frac{dn}{d \eta}, $$ where $J^{-1}=\sqrt{M(1+\sinh^2
y)}/\sqrt{1+M\sinh^2 y}$ with $M = 1 + (m/p_{\rm t})^2$. Their data of pion and
all hadrons are fairly well explained by the O-U process. To compare our
approach with another one, a phenomenological formula by Eskola et al. is also
used in calculations of $dn/d\eta$.

semi-relativistic approaches, which contain important aspects of relativity,
are implemented in a distorted wave analysis of quasielastic $(e,e'p)$

coherence, rho12 = -1/2, between the ground state sublevels 1 and 2. This
pumping scheme involves equal intensity fields that are resonant with both the
one and two-photon transitions of the lambda system. There is no steady-state
absorption of these fields, implying that the fields induce a type
electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) in the medium. An additional
pair of fields interacting with the second lambda system, combined with the EIT
fields, leads to squeezing of the atom spin associated with the ground state
sublevels. Our method involves a new mechanism for creating steady-state spin
squeezing using an optical cavity. As the cooperativity parameter C is
increased, the optimal squeezing varies as C^{-1/3}. For experimentally
accessible values of C, squeezing as large as 90% can be achieved.

principle of least action is zero, one can assign a ""quantum information"" to
quantum mechanical degree of freedom equal to Hausdorff area of the deviation
from a classical path. This raises the question whether superfluids carry
quantum information. We show that in general the transition from the classical
to quantum behavior depends on the probing length scale, and occurs for
microscopic length scales, except when the interactions between the particles
are very weak. This transition explains why, on macroscopic length scales,
physics is described by classical equations.

Version 3: Small corrections were made","Phys. Rev. A 68, 012101 (2003).","10.1103/PhysRevA.68.012101",,"quant-ph",,"  We show that spin squeezing implies pairwise entanglement for arbitrary
symmetric multiqubit states. If the squeezing parameter is less than or equal
to 1, we demonstrate a quantitative relation between the squeezing parameter
and the concurrence for the even and odd states. We prove that the even states
generated from the initial state with all qubits being spin down, via the
one-axis twisting Hamiltonian, are spin squeezed if and only if they are
pairwise entangled. For the states generated via the one-axis twisting
Hamiltonian with an external transverse field for any number of qubits greater
than 1 or via the two-axis counter-twisting Hamiltonian for any even number of
qubits, the numerical results suggest that such states are spin squeezed if and
only if they are pairwise entangled.

weakly coupled mapping systems is influenced by the chaotic dynamics of the
corresponding classical system. We derive a general perturbative formula for
the entanglement production rate which is defined by using the linear entropy
of the subsystem. This formula predicts that {\it the increment of the strength
of chaos does not enhance the production rate of entanglement} when the
coupling is weak enough and the subsystems are strongly chaotic. The prediction
is confirmed by numerical experiments for coupled kicked tops and rotors. We
also discuss the entanglement production using the Husimi representation of the
reduced density matrix.

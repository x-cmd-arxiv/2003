degenerate product \sigma_8\Omega^0.6. The degeneracy is broken by measuring
the skewness arising from the fact that densities must remain positive, which
is not possible when the initially symmetric perturbations become non-linear.
Skewness measures the non-linear mass scale, which in combination with the
variance measures \Omega directly. We present the first detection of dark
matter skewness from the Virmos-Decart survey. We have measured the full three
point function, and its projections onto windowed skewness. We separate the
lensing mode and the B mode. The lensing skewness is detected for a compensated
Gaussian on scales of 5.37 arc minutes to be \kappa^3=1.06+/-0.06x10^-6. The

data from all DLAs with measurements of nitrogen and alpha-capture elements (O,
S or Si) available in the literature, including all HIRES/Keck and UVES/VLT
data for a total of 33 systems, i.e. the largest sample investigated so far. We
find that [N/alpha] ratios are distributed in two groups: 75% of the DLAs show
a mean value of [N/alpha] = -0.87 with a scatter of 0.16 dex, while the
remaining 25% shows ratios clustered at [N/alpha] = -1.45 with an even lower
dispersion of 0.05 dex. The high [N/alpha] plateau is consistent with the one
observed in metal-poor HII regions of blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies
([N/alpha] = -0.73 +/- 0.13), while the [N/alpha] ~ -1.5 values are the lowest
ever observed in any astrophysical site. These low [N/alpha] ratios are real
and not due to ionization effects. They provide a crucial evidence against the
primary production of N by massive stars as responsible for the plateau at
-0.9/-0.7 dex observed in DLAs and BCD galaxies. The transition between the
low-N ([N/alpha] ~ -1.5) and high-N ([N/alpha] ~ -0.9) DLAs occurs at a
nitrogen abundance of [N/H] ~ -2.8, suggesting that the separation may result
from some peculiarity of the nitrogen enrichment history. The [N/alpha] ~ -1.5
values and their low dispersion are consistent with a modest production of
primary N in massive stars; however, due to the limited sample, specially for
the low-N DLAs, we cannot exclude a primary origin in intermediate mass stars
as responsible for the low N abundances observed.

sources such as absorption, scattering or scintillation by the interstellar
medium (ISM) of the lens galaxy, problems in the ellipsoidal macro models used
to fit lens systems, or stellar microlensing. We apply several tests to the
data that appear to rule out these alternate explanations. First, the radio
flux anomalies show no significant dependence on wavelength, as would be
expected for almost any propagation effect in the ISM or microlensing by the
stars. Second, the flux anomaly distributions show the characteristic
demagnifications of the brightest saddle point relative to the other images
expected for low optical depth substructure, which cannot be mimicked by either
the ISM or problems in the macro models. Microlensing by stars also cannot
reproduce the suppression of the bright saddle points if the radio source sizes
are consistent with the Compton limit for their angular sizes. Third, while it
is possible to change the smooth lens models to fit the flux anomalies in some
systems, we can rule out the necessary changes in all systems where we have
additional lens constraints to check the models. Moreover, the parameters of
these models are inconsistent with our present observations and expectations

Clouds with these volume densities and the observed neutral hydrogen column
densities will be largely ionized, even if exposed only to the extragalactic
ionizing radiation field. Here we examine the implications of this process for
models of CHVCs. We have modeled the ionization structure of spherical clouds
(with and without dark matter halos) for a large range of densities and sizes,
appropriate to CHVCs over the range of suggested distances, exposed to the
extragalactic ionizing photon flux. Constant-density cloud models in which the
CHVCs are at Local Group distances have total (ionized plus neutral) gas masses
roughly 20-30 times larger than the neutral gas masses, implying that the gas
mass alone of the observed population of CHVCs is about 40 billion solar
masses. With a realistic (10:1) dark matter to gas mass ratio, the total mass
in such CHVCs is a significant fraction of the dynamical mass of the Local
Group, and their line widths would exceed the observed FWHM. Models with dark
matter halos fare even more poorly; they must lie within approximately 200 kpc
of the Galaxy. We show that exponential neutral hydrogen column density
profiles are a natural consequence of an external source of ionizing photons,
and argue that these profiles cannot be used to derive model-independent
distances to the CHVCs. These results argue strongly that the CHVCs are not
cosmological objects, and are instead associated with the Galactic halo.

by a diluted gas. Standard one-dimensional photoionization models are usually
used to model this region in order to reproduce the observed emission lines.
Since the narrow line region is not homogeneous, two major types of models are
used: (a) those assuming a homogeneous gas distribution and a filling factor
less than unity to mimic the presence of the emitting clouds; (b) those based
on a composition of single-cloud models combined in order to obtain the
observed spectra. The first method is largely used but may induce to misleading
conclusions as shown in this paper. The second one is more appropriate, but
requires a large number of observed lines in order to limit the number of
single models used. After discussing the case of an extragalactic HII region,
for which the ionizing radiation spectrum is better known, we show that 1-D
models for the narrow line region with a filling factor less than unit do not
properly mimic the clumpiness, but just simulates an overall lower density.
Multi-cloud models lead to more reliable results. Both models are tested in
this paper, using the emission-line spectra of two well-known Seyfert galaxies,
NGC 4151 and NGC 1068. It is shown that ionizing radiation spectra with a blue
bump cannot be excluded by multi-cloud models, although excluded by Alexander

Photoevaporation of the disk by irradiation from the central star can produce a

$\mu$m H$_{2}$O ice absorption, with optical depth greater than 0.6, is also
detected in five nuclei, and 3.4 $\mu$m carbonaceous dust absorption is
detected clearly in one of the five nuclei. It is quantitatively demonstrated
that the large optical depths of the H$_{2}$O ice absorption in the five
sources, and the 3.4 $\mu$m absorption in one source, are incompatible with a
geometry in which the energy sources are spatially mixed with dust and
molecular gas, as is expected for a typical starburst, but instead require that
a large amount of nuclear dust (including ice-covered grains) and molecular gas
be distributed in a screen in front of the 3--4 $\mu$m continuum-emitting
sources. This geometrical requirement can naturally be met if the energy
sources are more centrally concentrated than the nuclear dust and molecular
gas. The low equivalent widths of the PAH emission compared to starbursts and
the central concentration of the nuclear energy sources in these five ULIRGs
are best explained by the presence of energetically important active galactic
nuclei deeply buried in dust and molecular gas.

this region determines the maximum energy of particles accelerated by the
diffusive shock acceleration mechanism. The high efficiency of cosmic ray
acceleration is accepted, and the consideration is not limited by the case of
weak turbulence. It is assumed that Kolmogorov type nonlinear wave interactions
together with the ion-neutral collisions restrict the amplitude of random
magnetic field. As a result, the maximum energy of accelerated particles
strongly depends on the age of supernova remnant. The maximum energy can be as
high as $\sim10^{17}Z$ eV in young supernova remnants and falls down to about
$\sim10^{10}Z$ eV at the end of Sedov stage. Thus the standard estimate of
maximum particle energy based on the Bohm limit calculated for the interstellar
magnetic field strength is not justified in this case. This finding may explain
why the supernova remnants with the age more than a few thousand years are not
prominent sources of very high energy gamma-rays.

Thus, observed afterglow emission is produced in the neutron trail. The impact

dependence of the anomalous EPR transitions first observed in Mn12-acetate by
Hill et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 2453 (1998)]. The most dominant of these
transitions manifest themselves as an extra series of EPR absorption peaks for
spectra obtained with the DC field applied within the hard magnetic plane of a
single crystal sample. Recent studies by Amigo et al. [Phys. Rev. B 65, 172403
(2002)] have attributed these extra peaks to a strain induced transverse
quadratic anisotropy which gives rise to distinct Mn12-acetate species, each
having a distinct EPR spectrum; on the basis of these measurements, it has been
suggested that this transverse anisotropy is responsible for the tunneling in
Mn12-acetate. Our temperature and frequency dependent measurements demonstrate
unambiguously that these anomalous EPR absorptions vanish as the temperature
tends to zero, thereby indicating that they correspond to transitions from an
excited state of the molecule. We argue that this low lying excited state
corresponds to an S = 9 multiplet having very similar zero-field crystal
parameters to the S = 10 state, and lying only about 10-15 k_B above the S = 10

zero-field Fermi-liquid state. This assumption is valid in 3D but, generally
speaking, erroneous in 2D where the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula may be applied
only if the oscillations are strongly damped by thermal smearing and disorder.
In this work, the effects of interactions and disorder on the amplitude of
magneto-oscillations in 2D are studied. It is found that the effective mass
diverges logarithmically with decreasing temperature signaling a deviation from
the Fermi-liquid behavior. It is also shown that the quasiparticle lifetime due
to inelastic interactions does not enter the oscillation amplitude, although
these interactions do renormalize the effective mass. This result provides a
generalization of the Fowler-Prange theorem formulated originally for the

of the hydrogen bonds that the water molecules form with the polar headgroups
of the surfactants, are calculated. Our earlier classification of the
interfacial water molecules, based on structural and energetic considerations,
into bound and free type is further validated by their dynamics. Lifetime
correlation functions of the water-surfactant hydrogen bonds show the long
lived nature of the bound water species. The water molecules that are singly
hydrogen bonded to the surfactants have longer lifetime than those that form
two such hydrogen bonds. The free water molecules that do not form any such
hydrogen bonds behave similar to bulk water in their reorientational dynamics.
A few water molecules that form two such hydrogen bonds are orientationally
locked in for durations of the order of few hundreds of picoseconds. The
intermolecular vibrational frequencies of these interfacial water molecules
shows a significant blue shift in the librational band apart from a similar
shift in the near neighbor bending modes, relative to water molecules in bulk.
These blue shifts suggest an increase in rigidity in the structure around
interfacial water molecules. This is in good agreement with recent incoherent,
inelastic neutron scattering data on macromolecular solutions. The results of
the present simulations should be relevant to the understanding of dynamics of
water near any hydrophilic surface.

particular the exponent 7/4 which was recently demonstrated to be the exact
value for the dimension of the so-called ""hull"" or external perimeter of the
incipient percolation cluster, controls the width and length of gradient
percolation frontiers whatever the gradient magnitude. This behavior is
extended to previous model studies of etching by a finite volume of etching
solution in contact with a disordered solid. In such a model, the dynamics stop
spontaneously on an equilibrium self-similar surface similar to the fractal
frontier of gradient percolation. It is shown that the power laws describing
the system geometry involves also the fractal dimension of the percolation
hull, whatever the value of the dynamically generated gradient, i.e. even for a
non-fractal frontier. The comparison between numerical results and the exact
results that can be obtained analytically for extreme values of the gradient
suggests that there exist a unique power law valid from the smallest possible
scale up to infinity. These results suggest the possible existence of an

rod-like virus fd sterically stabilized with the polymer polyethylene glycol
(PEG). After coating the virus with neutral polymers, the phase diagram and
nematic order parameter of the fd-PEG system then become independent of ionic
strength. Surprisingly, the fd-PEG suspensions not only continue to exhibit a
cholesteric phase, which means that the grafted polymer does not screen all
chiral interactions between rods, but paradoxically the cholesteric pitch of
this sterically stabilized fd-PEG system varies with ionic strength.
Furthermore, we observe that the cholesteric pitch decreases with increasing
viral contour length, in contrast to theories which predict the opposite trend.
Different models of the origin of chirality in colloidal liquid crystals are
discussed.

protected by supersymmetry, and consequently the electroweak scale is naturally
smaller than the composite Higgs scale. This not only provides a solution to
the hierarchy problem, but predicts a ``little'' hierarchy between the
electroweak and new physics scale. Remarkably, the model only contains a single
supersymmetric partner, the Higgsino (and possibly the stop), and as in the

examine the local entropy per particle produced between the ``freeze out'' era

entropy with the entropy per particle of actual galactic structures given in
terms of dynamical halo variables. We apply this criterion to the cases when
neutralinos are mosly b-inos and mostly higgsinos, in conjunction with the
usual ``abundance'' criterion requiring that present neutralino relic density
complies with $0.1 < \Omega_{\chic{\tilde\chi^0_1}} < 0.3$ for $h\simeq 0.65$.
The joint application of both criteria reveals that a better fitting occurs for
the b-ino channels, hence the latter seem to be favoured over the higgsino
channels. The suggested methodology can be applied to test other annihilation
channels of the neutralino, as well as other particle candidates of thermal
gases relics.

study the properties of the pion in dense medium using Skyrme's effective
Lagrangian as a unified theory of the hadronic interactions applicable in the

skyrmion matter which appears in two differentiated phases as a function of
matter density: i) at high densities as a stable cubic-centered (CC)
half-skyrmion crystal; ii) at low densities as an unstable face-centered cubic
(FCC) skyrmion crystal. We substitute the latter by a stable inhomogeneous
phase of lumps of dense matter, which represents a naive Maxwell construction
of the phase transition. This baryonic dense medium serves as a background for
the pions whose effective {\em in-medium} Lagrangian we construct by allowing
time-dependent quantum fluctuations on the classical dense matter field. We
find that the same parameter which describes the phase transition for baryonic
matter, the expectation value of the $\sigma$ field, also describes the phase
transition for the dynamics of the {\em in-medium} pion. Thus, the structure of
the baryonic ground state $crucially$ determines the behavior of the pion in
the medium. As matter density increases, $<\sigma>$ decreases, a phenomenon
which we interpret to signal, in terms of the parameters of the effective pion
Lagrangian $f_\pi^*$ and $m_\pi^*$, the restoration of chiral symmetry at high
density. Our calculation shows also the important role played by the higher
powers in the density as it increases and chiral symmetry is being restored.
This feature is likely to be generic at high density although our ground state
may not be the true ground state.

evaluate the moduli effective potential induced by bulk scalar fields in these

broken not far below the cutoff scale, and the hierarchy between the
electroweak and the effective Planck scales is generated by a combination of
redshift and large volume effects. The latter is efficient due to the shrinking
of $\Sigma$ at the negative tension brane, where matter is placed. In this

unity is investigated from a quantum group theoretic point of view. Employing
the concept of intertwiners associated with the quantum loop algebra
$U_q(\tilde{sl}_2)$ at $q^N=1$ a three parameter family of auxiliary matrices
is constructed. The elements of this family satisfy a functional relation with
the transfer matrix allowing one to solve the eigenvalue problem of the model
and to derive the Bethe ansatz equations. This functional relation is obtained
from the decomposition of a tensor product of evaluation representations and
involves auxiliary matrices with different parameters. Because of this
dependence on additional parameters the auxiliary matrices break in general the
finite symmetries of the six-vertex model, such as spin-reversal or spin
conservation. More importantly, they also lift the extra degeneracies of the
transfer matrix due to the loop symmetry present at rational coupling values.
The extra parameters in the auxiliary matrices are shown to be directly related
to the elements in the enlarged center of the quantum loop algebra
$U_q(\tilde{sl}_2)$ at $q^N=1$. This connection provides a geometric
interpretation of the enhanced symmetry of the six-vertex model at rational
coupling. The parameters labelling the auxiliary matrices can be interpreted as
coordinates on a three-dimensional complex hypersurface which remains invariant
under the action of an infinite-dimensional group of analytic transformations,
called the quantum coadjoint action.

introduction of a linearized KdV hierarchy. This allows one to give an
expression of the higher order time derivatives that appear in the right hand
member of the perturbative expansion equations, to show that overall the higher
order terms do not produce any secularity and to prove that the formal
expansion contains only bounded terms.

symmetric and ordered expansions of non-commuting operators of a bosonic
theory. As a direct application of such quantization rules, we quantize a
classically time evolved function
  $\mathcal{O}(q,p,t)$, and calculate its expectation value in coherent states.
The result can be expressed in terms of the application of a classical operator
which performs a {\em Gaussian smoothing} of the original function
$\mathcal{O}$ evaluated at the center of the coherent state. This scheme
produces a natural semi-classical expansion for the quantum expectation values
at a short time scale. Moreover, since the classical Liouville evolution of a
Gaussian probability density gives the {\bf same} form for the classical
statistical mean value, we can calculate the first order correction in $\hbar$
entirely from the associated classical time evolved function. This allows us to
write a general expression for the Ehrenfest time in terms of the departure of
the centroid of the quantum distribution from the classical trajectory provided
we start with an initially coherent state for each subsystem. In order to
illustrate this approach, we have calculated analytically the Ehrenfest time of
a model with $N$ coupled non-linear oscillators with non-linearity of even
order.

features of coherent control of four-wave mixing as well as of the accompanying
processes in the continuous-wave regime, which involve transitions between
bound and free quantum states. Such opportunities become feasible through
constructive and destructive interference of quantum pathways. Two coupling
schemes of practical importance are investigated. In the first, a ladder energy
level scheme, fully-resonant sum-frequency nonlinear-optical generation of
short-wavelength radiation driven by several strong fields is investigated. The
relaxation processes as well as absorption of the fundamental and generated
radiations, which play an important role, are taken into consideration. It is
shown that the generation output can be considerably increased through the
appropriate adjustment of several laser-induced continuum structures. In the
second, a folded scheme, a possible control of two-photon dissociation
(Lambda-scheme) using auxiliary laser radiation applied to the adjacent
bound-free transition (V-configuration) is investigated. Besides dissociation,
the proposed method enables one to control population transfer between two
upper discreet levels via the lower-energy dissociation continuum, while direct
transition between these states is not allowed. The opportunities of
manipulating these processes as well as of four-wave-mixing-based spectroscopy
are explored both analytically and through a numerical simulation for Na_2

other is the electronic transition between PES's. Because the latter process is
mathematically equivalent to nonadiabatic transitions between Floquet (dressed)

Lick absorption indices (Thomas et al. 2003) by comparing two sets of alpha/Fe
enhanced models. In both models the impact on Lick indices due to alpha/Fe
enhancement is accounted for through a modification of the stellar absorption
line-strengths using the response functions of Tripicco & Bell (1995). One set
of models, however, uses solar-scaled, the other alpha/Fe enhanced stellar
evolutionary tracks. Since the alpha/Fe enhanced tracks are hotter than the
solar-scaled ones (Salasnich et al. 2000), the correspondent stellar population
models have slightly weaker metallic indices (i.e. Mgb, <Fe> etc.) and stronger
Balmer line indices (Hbeta) (Maraston et al 2003). Here we explore
quantitatively the impact of this effect on the alpha/Fe ratios, metallicities
and ages that are derived for elliptical galaxies. We find that the modest
decrease of the metallic indices Mgb and <Fe> balance each other, such that
fully consistent alpha/Fe ratios are derived for stellar systems using alpha/Fe
enhanced models with either solar-scaled or alpha/Fe enhanced stellar tracks.
The decrease of the metallic indices and the increase of Hbeta conspire in a
way that also consistent metallicities are obtained. The derived ages, instead,
are significantly different. The inclusion of alpha/Fe enhanced stellar tracks
leads to the derivation of ages as high as 30 Gyr for elliptical galaxies. For
the same objects, ages not older than 15 Gyr are obtained, if alpha/Fe enhanced
models using solar-scaled tracks are adopted. This may indicate that current
stellar evolutionary models overestimate the bluing of stellar evolutionary
tracks due to alpha/Fe enhanced chemical mixtures at super-solar metallicities.

$\Omega_m$ is known to 10% accuracy, SNAP will be able to determine the sign of
the time dependence of the dark energy density. Knowledge of this sign (which
is related to the weak energy condition) will provide a first discrimination
between various cosmological models that fit the current observational data

some Cardassian models can satisfy the weak energy condition $w>-1$ even with a

poorer system. We present wide-field, high sensitivity 1.4 GHz VLA radio
observations of Abell 2256 in conjunction with optical imaging and additional
spectroscopy. Over 40 cluster radio galaxies are identified, with optical
spectroscopy indicating the emission source (star formation or AGN) for most of
them. While the overall fraction of galaxies exhibiting radio emission is
consistent with a large sample of other nearby clusters, we find an increase in
the activity level of galaxies belonging to the third system (hereafter, the
``Group''). Specifically, the Group has relatively more star formation than
both the primary cluster and main subcluster. The position of the Group is also
coincident with the observed cluster radio relic. We suggest that the Group
recently (~0.3 Gyr) merged with the primary cluster and that this merger, not
the ongoing merger of the primary and the main subcluster, might be responsible
for many of the unusual radio properties of Abell 2256. Furthermore, the
greater star formation activity of the Group suggests that the infall of groups
is an important driver of galaxy evolution in clusters.

of ROSAT sets an upper limit on the Omega_m-sigma_8 plane which excludes all
the models with sigma_8 above sigma_8 = 0.5/(Omega_m^0.38) in a flat LCDM

this relation could be constrained by using the X-ray power spectrum, if the

low value of sigma_8 (sigma_8 < 0.8 for Omega_m = 0.3) may be compatible with

to the nuclear physics aspects: the straight-ahead approximation that describes
the distribution of fragment energies and the assumption that the major
contributor to the production rate arises from single-step reactions between
primary cosmic ray projectiles and interstellar medium targets. We examine both
assumptions by using a semi-empirical description for the spall's energy
distribution and by including the reactions that proceed via intermediary
fragments. After relaxing the straight-ahead approximation we find the changes
in the production rates and emerging fluxes are small and do not warrant
rejection of this approximation. In contrast we discover that two-step
reactions can alter the production rate considerably leading to noticeable
increases in the efficiency of producing the LiBeB nuclei. Motivated by this
result we introduce a cascade technique to compute the production rates exactly
and find that the results differ only slightly from those of our two-step
calculations. We thus conclude that terminating the reaction network at the

for photometric transits. This algorithm identified 8 candidate stars showing
multiple transit-like events, plus 3 stars with single eclipses. On closer

  extended sources","14 pages",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Both the standard theory of thermal radio emission and the synchrotron theory
encounter some difficulties. The most crucial for the former one is
nonpossibility to explain the radio spectrum of Venus in the decimeter range
(Ksanfomality 1985). The radio spectra of planetary nebulae at high frequencies
also are not comfortably consistent with the standard theory (Siodmiak &
Tylenda 2001). Here we show that the account for an induced character of
radiation processes sufficiently improves the predictions of the standard
theory.
  Moreover, the developed here theory of radio emission from non-uniform gas
gives the radio spectra of extended sources, such as supernova remnants and
radio galaxies, which are normally attributed to the synchrotron emission. It
is important, in this aspect, that the synchrotron self-absorption produces a
change in the polarization position angle across the spectral peak. No such a
change was detected in gigahertz-peaked spectrum sources (Mutoh et al. 2002).
Besides, the flat or slightly inverted radio spectra of low-luminosity active
galactic nuclei are not easily consistent with the synchrotron radiation
mechanism (Nagar, Wilson & Falcke 2001, Ulvestad & Ho 2001).
  Thermal radiation in a magnetic field is polarized (see, e.g., Lang 1978).
This is also true for radiation considered in the present paper, which can be
described as incoherent induced radiation (Prigara 2001b).

several cases. In the case where the occupation matrix of localized orbitals is
chosen as a basic variable, we can obtain the single-particle equation which is
equivalent to that of the LDA+U method. The theory also leads to the
Hartree-Fock-Kohn-Sham equation by letting the exchange energy be a basic

near the Fermi level is chosen as a basic variable, the resulting
single-particle equation includes the additional potential which could mainly
modify the energy-band structures near the Fermi level.

(i) volatility autocorrelations that have a very long range memory, on the

models have been proposed in the past to account for both these correlations.
However, in these models, the decay of the correlations is exponential, with a
single time scale for both the volatility and the leverage correlations, at
variance with observations. We extend the linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic
volatility model by assuming that the mean reverting level is itself random. We

macroscopic flow curves for a range of (average) concentrations. For any
concentration high enough to give shear banding, the flow curve shows the usual
non-analytic kink at the onset of banding, followed by a coexistence
``plateau'' that slopes upwards. As the concentration is reduced, the width of
the coexistence regime diminishes, then terminates at a non-equilibrium
critical point. We outline the way in which the flow phase diagram can be
reconstructed from a family of such flow curves measured for several different

questions, including the horizon problem, the flatness problem, and others.
However, inflation yields new questions relating to the flatness of the
inflaton potential. Recent studies of ``little'' fields, a special class of
pseudo-Goldstone bosons, have shown it is possible to protect the mass of a
field while still yielding order one interactions with other fields. In this
paper, we will show that ``little inflatons'' are natural candidates for the
slow roll field of hybrid inflation models. We consider both supersymmetric and
non-supersymmetric models, and give a simple examples based on approximate
Abelian symmetries which solve the inflaton flatness problem of supergravity.
We also present hybrid models in which components of gauge fields in higher
dimensions play the role of the inflaton. Protected by higher-dimensional gauge
symmetry, they, too, naturally have large couplings while suppressed mass
terms. We summarize the implications of the new WMAP data on such models.

provide a natural explanation of two large mixing angles. On the contrary we
should adopt ""zero texture"" which have been extensively studied by many authors
and only this scenario can reproduce two large mixing angles naturally. Under
such ""zero texture"" with minimal symmetric Majorana matrix, all the neutrino
masses and mixing angles, 6 quantities, are expressed in terms of up-quark
masses, $m_t,m_c,m_u$ with two adjustable parameters. This provides interesting
relations among neutrio mixing angles, $\tan^2 2\theta_{12} \simeq

responsible for dilaton stabilization. Although no specific model-building is
attempted, if the inflationary energy density is related to the scale of
gaugino condensation, then the dilaton may be stabilized close enough to
today's value that there is no significant change in the GUT scale coupling.
This can occur in a very wide range of models, and helps to provide some
justification for the standard predictions of the spectral index. I explain how

Lett. 16(3), 225-244 (2003)",,,"physics.acc-ph physics.class-ph",,"  We analyze in this work the energy transfer process of accelerated charges,
the mass fluctuations accompanying this process, and their inertial properties.
Based on a previous work, we use here the dipole antenna, which is a very
convenient framework for such analysis, for analyzing those characteristics. We
show that the radiation process can be viewed by two energy transfer processes:
one from the energy source to the charges and the second from the charges into
the surrounding space. Those processes, not being in phase, result in mass
fluctuations. The same principle is true during absorption. We show that in a
transient period between absorption and radiation the dipole antenna gains mass
according to the amount of absorbed energy and loses this mass as radiated
energy. We rigorously prove that the gain of mass, resulting from electrical
interaction has inertial properties in the sense of Newton's third low. We
arrive to this result by modeling the reacting spacetime region by an electric
dipole.

  Drop","11 two-column pages, 4 integrated eps plates, RevTeX4",,,,"physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph q-bio.BM",,"  Clarification of the detailed mechanisms involved in the DNA polymorphism is
an important challenge for computational molecular biophysics. This paper
reports about reversible A/B transitions in DNA observed in silico in a
simulated titration experiment by smooth variation of the size of a water drop
around a double helical solute. The estimated range of hydration numbers
corresponding to the B/A transition roughly agrees with experimental data. The
chain length dependence was studied and it appeared that the transition to
A-form is hindered when the fragment becomes shorter than one helical turn.
Dynamics of the A/B transition at low hydration is cooperative and is driven
mainly by medium range electrostatic interactions of counterions sandwiched
between phosphate strands in the major groove. The correspondence of these
computational observations to common experimental conditions of A/B transitions
is discussed.

we show how, by appropriately shaping the pulses, resonant multiphoton
transitions can be enhanced significantly beyond the level achieved by
maximizing the pulse's peak intensity. We demonstrate the counterintuitive
nature of this effect with an experiment in a resonant two-photon absorption,
in which, by selectively removing certain spectral bands, the peak intensity of
the pulse is reduced by a factor of 40, yet the absorption rate is doubled.
Furthermore, by suitably designing the spectral phase of the pulse, we increase
the absorption rate by a factor of 7.

  Distribution","74 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  For the four-state protocol of quantum key distribution, optimum sets of
probe parameters are calculated for the most general unitary probe in which
each individual transmitted photon is made to interact with the probe so that
the signal and the probe are left in an entangled state, and projective
measurement by the probe, made subsequent to projective measurement by the
legitimate receiver, yields information about the signal state. The probe
optimization is based on maximizing the Renyi information gain by the probe on
corrected data for a given error rate induced by the probe in the legitimate
receiver. An arbitrary angle is included between the nonorthogonal linear
polarization states of the signal photons. Two sets of optimum probe parameters
are determined which both correspond to the same optimization. Also, a larger
set of optimum probe parameters is found than was known previously for the
standard BB84 protocol. A detailed comparison is made between the complete and
incomplete optimizations, and the latter simpler optimization is also made
complete. Also, the process of key distillation from the quantum transmission
in quantum key distribution is reviewed, with the objective of calculating the
secrecy capacity of the four-state protocol in the presence of the
eavesdropping probe. Emphasis is placed on information leakage to the probe.

This seems to leave an ambiguity in the choice of the description. I argue that

exhaustive analysis of several eavesdropping attacks on these schemes. The
eavesdropper (Eve) is supposed to have unlimited technological power while the
honest parties (Alice and Bob) use present day technology, in particular an
attenuated laser as an approximation of a single-photon source. They exploit
the nonorthogonality of quantum states for decreasing the information
accessible to Eve in the multi-photon pulses accidentally produced by the
imperfect source. An implementation of some of these protocols using present
day technology allow for a secure key distribution up to distances of $\sim$
150 km. We also show that strong-pulse implementations, where a strong pulse is
included as a reference, allow for key distribution robust against photon

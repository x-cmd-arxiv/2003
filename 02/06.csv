line not only modulated on the orbital period, but also on time-scales of a few
days. During the first epoch of observation, the emission line shows a strong
S-wave superimposed on the average double-peaked profile. The line exhibits no
evidence of rotational disturbance at the orbital phases when the eclipse is
observed in the optical continuum. During the second epoch, no double-peak or
S-wave component is present. The HeI absorption lines detected by other authors
are not present in our spectra. A Doppler image of the HeII 4686 for the first
epoch supports the presence of the accretion disc. No hotspot is detected,
although enhanced emission at V_X=30km/s, V_Y=160 km/s is observed. We discuss
the implications of this emission in the context of an X-ray heated donor star,
in which case a high mass ratio and neutron star primary are implied. Finally,
we speculate on the possibility of a misaligned secondary star in AC211.

of scaling relations between X-ray and SZ effect observables and also between
the two primary SZ effect observables is presented. We find that relationships
between the central Compton parameter and the temperature or mass of a cluster
are extremely sensitive to the presence of an entropy floor. The same is true
for correlations between the integrated Compton parameter and the X-ray
luminosity or the central Compton parameter. In fact, if the entropy floor is
as high as inferred in recent analyses of X-ray data, a comparison of these
correlations with both current and future SZ effect observations should show a
clear signature of this excess entropy. Moreover, because the SZ effect is
redshift-independent, the relations can potentially be used to track the
evolution of the cluster gas and possibly discriminate between the possible
sources of the excess entropy. To facilitate comparisons with observations, we
provide analytic fits to these scaling relations.

I, Ca II, K I, and other species -- for individual components identified in the

information on relative electron densities and depletions. There is no obvious
relationship between the ratio N(Ca I)/N(Ca II) [equal to n_e/(Gamma/alpha_r)
for photoionization equilibrium] and the fraction of hydrogen in molecular form
f(H2) (often taken to be indicative of the local density n_H). For a smaller
sample of sightlines for which the thermal pressure (n_H T) and local density
can be estimated via analysis of the C I fine-structure excitation, the average
electron density inferred from C, Na, and K (assuming photoionization
equilibrium) seems to be independent of n_H and n_H T. While the n_e obtained
from the ratio N(Ca I)/N(Ca II) is often significantly higher than the values
derived from other elements, the patterns of relative n_e derived from
different elements show both similarities and differences for different lines
of sight -- suggesting that additional processes besides photoionization and
radiative recombination commonly and significantly affect the ionization
balance of heavy elements in diffuse IS clouds. Such additional processes may
also contribute to the (apparently) larger than expected fractional ionizations
(n_e/n_H) found for some lines of sight with independent determinations of n_H.
In general, inclusion of ``grain-assisted'' recombination does reduce the
inferred n_e, but it does not reconcile the n_e estimated from different

simplified expression the CPU time can be greatly reduced. We test the
stability of our power spectrum estimator with realistic simulations of Planck

frequency dependence of the Galactic emissions. Without prior information about
any of the components, our new estimator can recover the CMB power spectrum up
to scales l~1500 with less than 10% error. This result is significantly
improved if the brightest point sources are removed before applying our
estimator. In this way, the CMB power spectrum can be recovered up to l~1700

the one that would be obtained in the ideal case of only CMB plus white noise,

masses between those of ""stellar-mass"" and ""super-massive"" black holes. The
existence of IMBHs is a real possibility: they might plausibly have formed as
remnants of the first generation of stars (Population III), as the result of
dense star cluster evolution, or as part of the formation process of
super-massive black holes. Their cosmic mass density could exceed that of
super-massive black holes (Omega = 10^{-5.7}) and observations do not even rule
out that they may account for all of the baryonic dark matter in the Universe
(Omega = 10^{-1.7}). Unambiguous detections of individual IMBHs currently do
not exist, but there are observational hints from studies of microlensing
events, ""ultra-luminous"" X-ray sources, and centers of nearby galaxies and
globular clusters. Gravitational wave experiments will soon provide another
method to probe their existence. IMBHs have potential importance for several
fields of astrophysics and are likely to grow as a focus of research attention.

well-known Sweet-Parker scheme, discuss effects of tearing modes, anomalous
resistivity and the concept of hyperresistivity. We show that the field
stochasticity by itself provides a way to enable fast reconnection even if, at
the scale of individual turbulent wiggles, the reconnection happens at the slow
Sweet-Parker rate. We show that fast reconnection allows efficient mixing of
magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to the local direction of
magnetic field. While the idea of stochastic reconnection still requires
numerical confirmation, our numerical simulations testify that mixing motions
perpendicular to the local magnetic field are up to high degree hydrodynamical.
This suggests that the turbulent heat transport should be similar to that in
non-magnetized turbulent fluid, namely, should have a diffusion coefficient
\sim LV_L, where V_L is the amplitude of the turbulent velocity and L is the
scale of the turbulent motions. We present numerical simulations which support
this conclusion. The application of this idea to thermal conductivity in
clusters of galaxies shows that this mechanism may dominate the diffusion of
heat and may be efficient enough to prevent cooling flow formation.

it initiates a network of chemical reactions that produce many interstellar
molecules. In dense clouds, the H3+ abundance is understood using a simple
chemical model, from which observations of H3+ yield valuable estimates of
cloud path length, density, and temperature. On the other hand, observations of
diffuse clouds have suggested that H3+ is considerably more abundant than
expected from the chemical models. However, diffuse cloud models have been
hampered by the uncertain values of three key parameters: the rate of H3+
destruction by electrons, the electron fraction, and the cosmic-ray ionisation
rate. Here we report a direct experimental measurement of the H3+ destruction
rate under nearly interstellar conditions. We also report the observation of
H3+ in a diffuse cloud (towards zeta Persei) where the electron fraction is
already known. Taken together, these results allow us to derive the value of
the third uncertain model parameter: we find that the cosmic-ray ionisation
rate in this sightline is forty times faster than previously assumed. If such a
high cosmic-ray flux is indeed ubiquitous in diffuse clouds, the discrepancy
between chemical models and the previous observations of H3+ can be resolved.

time-averaged spectrum, with an equivalent width of 310^{+70}_{-90} eV.
Time-resolved spectral analysis of the heavily absorbed soft X-ray band
confirms the existence of a variable, multi-zone warm absorber in this source,
as proposed in a previous analysis of a shorter ASCA observation. The light
curve of the source is wildly variable on timescales of hours or less, and a
factor of nearly 10 change in count-rate was recorded in a period of less than
2000 s. The long observation and variability of the source allowed the power
density spectrum (PDS) to be constructed to an unprecedented level of detail.
There is evidence for a break in the PDS from a slope of \alpha~1 to \alpha~1.8
at a frequency of around 3 \times 10^{-4} Hz. The central black hole mass of
NGC 4395 is estimated to be approximately 10^4-10^5 solar masses using the

Fabry-Perot interferometer CADIS can detect emission lines in three waveband

rates of >10Msun/yr at z=6. Candidate Ly-Alpha-emitting galaxies are selected
from the total emission line sample, which contains more than 97% of objects at
z<1.2, by the absence of flux below the Lyman limit (B-band ""dropouts""), and
the non-detection of secondary emission lines in narrow band filters. We have
detected 5 bright Ly-Alpha-emitting galaxy candidates at z ~ 4.8, and 11

candidate at z ~ 4.8, and the other at z ~ 5.7, the emission line detected with

to Ly-Alpha surveys at z<3.5 even the upper limits set by our list of

a factor of ~20 between z = 1.2 and today. In fact, for a Omega(m) = 0.3,

proportional to exp(-lookback_time) / 2.6Gyr). The inferred SF density is in
perfect agreement with that deduced from the FIR emission of optically selected
galaxies which is explained by a large overlap between both populations. We
show that self-consistent extinction corrections of both our emission lines and

described by nonequilibrium thermodynamics formalism. The description assumes
that the thermodynamic (internal) state variables are in local equilibrium, and
uses the well known flux-force relations, with the Onsager coefficients
involved, ending eventually up at a local conservation law of Fokker-Planck
type. One of central problems arising when applying it to the matter
agglomeration phenomena, quite generally termed nucleation-and-growth process,
appears to be some physically accepted identification of entropic barriers, or
factors impeding growth. In this paper, we wish to propose certain
geometric-kinetic obstacles as serious candidates for the so-called entropic
barriers. Within the framework of the thermodynamic formalism offered they are
always associated with a suitable choice of a physical potential governing the
system. It turns out that a certain choice of the potential of Coulomb (or,
gravitational) type leads to emphasizing the role of the Gaussian curvature
while another choice in a form of the logaritmic physical potential results
unavoidably in a pronounced role of the mean curvature. The whole reasoning has
been tested succesfully on a statistical-mechanical polycris- talline evolution
model introduced some years ago for physical-metalurgical purposes, and
modified for a use in biophysical soft-matter agglomerations.

Adsorption on the surface in fcc sites is energetically favorable for low

oxide-like structures resembling compressed Ag2O(111) surfaces are

current theories that postulate that our universe is a 4-dimensional
hypersurface Sigma_0 within a 5-dimensional manifold, such as Space-Time-Matter
(STM) theory and the Randall & Sundrum (RS) braneworld scenario. In particular,
we determine whether or not arbitrary spacetimes may be embedded in such
theories, and demonstrate how these seemingly disparate models are
interconnected. Special attention is given to the motion of test observers in 5
dimensions, and the circumstances under which they are confined to Sigma_0. For
each 5-dimensional scenario considered, the requirement that observers be
confined to the embedded spacetime places restrictions on the 4-geometry. For
example, we find that observers in the thin braneworld scenario can be
localized around the brane if its total stress-energy tensor obeys the
5-dimensional strong energy condition. As a concrete example of some of our

constraints are multilinear (type I), then it is possible to regularize the
system so that the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions are equivalent. When
the constraints are power of a linear function (type II), regularization is not
always possible and the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions may be
dynamically inequivalent. It is shown that the inequivalence between the two
formalisms can occur if the kinetic energy is an indefinite quadratic form in
the velocities. It is also shown that a system of type I can evolve in time
from a regular configuration into an irregular one, without any catastrophic
changes. Irregularities have important consequences in the linearized
approximation to nonlinear theories, as well as for the quantization of such
systems. The relevance of these problems to Chern-Simons theories in higher
dimensions is discussed.

with trace zero module $\SE$. The method we use is based on the infinitesimal
techniques that we develop to show that if the support curve admits such a
double cover then every embedded ribbon over the curve is ``infinitesimally

some first--order infinitesimal deformation of the map obtained by composing
the double cover with the embedding of the reduced support in the ambient
projective space containing the ribbon. We also obtain embeddings in the same
projective space for all ribbons associated with $\SE$. Then, assuming the
existence of the double cover, we prove that the ``infinitesimal smoothing''

It is shown how the notion of quantum-nonlocality has to be redefined in the

prepared locally and exhibit some form of nonlocality. Moreover, the notion of
local distinguishability in the presence of classical communication has to be
altered. This can be used to perform quantum information tasks that are
otherwise impossible. In particular, this leads to the introduction of perfect
quantum data hiding protocols, for which quantum communication (eventually in
the form of a separable but nonlocal state) is needed to unlock the secret.

non-interacting collection of fermions at zero temperature can be entangled in
spin providing that their distances do not exceed the inverse Fermi wavenumber.
Beyond this distance all bipartite entanglement vanishes, although classical
correlations still persist. We compute the entanglement of formation as well as
the mutual information for two spin-correlated electrons as a function of their
distance. The analogous non-interacting collection of bosons displays no
entanglement in the internal degrees of freedom. We show how to generalize our

entanglement. Surprisingly, we find the transition to be abrupt for bipartite
systems: distillable states emerge arbitrarily close to the LSB. For
multipartite systems, while the radius of the LSB remains unknown, we determine
the radius of the largest undistillable ball. Our results also provide an upper

particle leads to a different theoretical prediction for low energy
bremsstrahlung than does quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the calculations,
the electromagnetic fields are treated classically in the hydrodynamic case,
but are quantized in QED. Calculations show the hydrodynamic model to have a
different and more sensitive dependence on the size and shape of the radiating
particle's wave packet then does QED. In particular it is shown that
bremsstrahlung is sometimes greatly reduced when the force acting on the
particle is localized to a volume small compared to the particle's wave packet.
QED exhibits no such reduction. Therefore it is possible to test this effect
experimentally.
  An experiment is proposed. It involves an electron microscope with a Wien
filter for producing monochromatic beam electrons and an accurate energy
measurement of the particle after passing through a local force field.

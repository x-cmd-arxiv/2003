numerous experimental tests, gravity in the strong-field regime is largely
unconstrained by observations. We show that gravity theories that cannot be
rejected by solar system tests but that diverge from general relativity in the
strong-field regime predict neutron stars with significantly different
properties than their general relativistic counterparts. In particular, the
range of redshifts of surface atomic lines predicted by such gravity theories
is significantly larger than the uncertainty introduced by our lack of
knowledge of the equation of state of ultra-dense matter. Measurements of such

Although difficult to detect, these protons may show up through their

thermal gas in the supernova ejecta. Inelastic proton-proton (p-p) collisions
are expected to be very effective in young objects, resulting in a copious
production of neutral and charged pions. Charged pions produced during the
first few hundred years after the supernova explosion may have time to decay
into muons, whose subsequent decay may provide an additional source of
electrons and positrons in these nebulae, that sums up to the pulsar input.
These secondary leptons evolve just as the pairs in the pulsar wind, and
signatures of their presence could be found, in principle, even in the
synchrotron spectrum of older objects. p-p collisions may remain fairly
efficient even in moderately old objects resulting in the production of TeV
gamma-rays and neutrinos. We apply our calculations to the case of the Crab

  We demonstrate that both KUV 05134+2605 and PG 1654+160 pulsate in many modes

1654+160 is also indicated. Beating of multiple pulsation modes cannot explain
our observations; the amplitude variability must therefore be intrinsic. We
cannot find stable modes to be used for determinations of the evolutionary
period changes of the stars. Some of the modes of PG 1654+160 appear at the
same periods whenever detected. The mean spacing of these periods (about 40s)
suggests that they are probably caused by non-radial gravity-mode pulsations of
spherical degree l=1. If so, PG 1654+160 has a mass around 0.6 Msun.
  The time scales of the amplitude variability of both stars (down to two
weeks) are consistent with theoretical predictions of resonant mode coupling, a
conclusion which might however be affected by the temporal distribution of our
data.

multiperiodic with at least three modes of pulsation. Mode identification from
the relative colour amplitudes is performed. We obtain unambiguous results for
the two highest-amplitude modes of IL Vel (both are l=1) and the three
strongest modes of KZ Mus (l=2,0 and 1), but none for V433 Car. Spectroscopy
shows the latter star to be a fast rotator (v sin i = 240 km/s), whereas the
other two have moderate v sin i (65 and 47 km/s, respectively). We performed
model calculations with the Warsaw-New Jersey stellar evolution and pulsation
code. We find that IL Vel is an object of about 12 Msun in the second half of
its main sequence evolutionary track. Its two dipole modes are most likely
rotationally split components of the mode originating as p1 on the ZAMS; one of
these modes is m=0. V433 Car is suggested to be an unevolved 13 Msun star just
entering the Beta Cephei instability strip. KZ Mus seems less massive (about
12.7 Msun) and somewhat more evolved, and its radial mode is probably the
fundamental one. In this case its quadrupole mode would be the one originating
as g1, and its dipole mode would be p1. It is suggested that mode
identification of slowly rotating Beta Cephei stars based on photometric colour
amplitudes is reliable; we estimate that a relative accuracy of 3% in the
amplitudes is sufficient for unambiguous identifications. Due to the good
agreement of our theoretical and observational results we conclude that the
prospects for asteroseismology of multiperiodic slowly rotating Beta Cephei
star are good.

variously; either the flow entropy is too low, the electron fraction is too
high, or the dynamical expansion timescale is too long. To date, no models have
included the effects of an ordered dipole magnetic field. We show that a strong

leading to much higher matter entropy. We estimate both the trapping timescale

Ori and B1 Sco, for which the C I measurements of Federman, Welty, & Cardelli
were used. Directions with known CH+ absorption, but only upper limits on
absorption from C2 and CN, were considered for our study. This restriction
allows us to focus on regions where CH+ chemistry dominates the production of
carbon-bearing molecules. Profile synthesis of several multiplets yielded
column densities and Doppler parameters for the C I fine structure levels.
Equilibrium excitation analyses, using the measured column densities as well as
the temperature from H2 excitation, led to values for gas density. These
densities, in conjunction with measurements of CH, CH+, C2, and CN column
densities, provided estimates for the amount of CH associated with CH+
production, which in turn set up constraints on the present theories for CH+
formation in this environment. We found for our sample of interstellar clouds
that on average, 30--40 % of the CH originates from CH+ chemistry, and in some
cases it can be as high as 90 %. A simple chemical model for gas containing
non-equilibrium production of CH+ was developed for the purpose of predicting
column densities for CH, CO, HCO+, CH2+, and CH3+ generated from large
abundances of CH+. Again, our results suggest that non-thermal chemistry is
necessary to account for the observed abundance of CH and probably that of CO
in these clouds.

very low (if any) dependence on metallicity over the broad range of
metallicities covered by our target galaxies. This finding is in contrast to
the mean I-band and J-band red clump star magnitudes, which do have a clear
metallicity dependence which we calibrate from our data. Excellent agreement
with the former calibration of the red clump I-band magnitude dependence on
metallicity of Udalski is found from our new data. We use the Galactic cluster
K-band red clump star data of Grocholski and Sarajedini to demonstrate that the
K-band red clump star absolute magnitude also has very little (if any)
dependence on age. The present study therefore provides clear evidence that the
mean K-band magnitude of red clump stars is an excellent distance indicator,
with very small (if any) population corrections to be applied over a large
range in metallicity and age. Comparing derived distances to those coming from
the observed mean I-band magnitudes of the red clump stars, we find evidence
that there is likely to be a problem in the photometric calibration of the
local, solar neighborhood red clump star K-band or I-band magnitudes which
amounts to some 0.2 mag. A re-determination of the absolute photometric
calibration of the Hipparcos-observed nearby red clump stars seems necessary to
resolve this problem.

GRB data. (2) The interpretation of the burst structure (IBS) paradigm
differentiates in all GRBs between an injector phase and a beam-target phase.
(3) The GRB-supernova time sequence (GSTS) paradigm introduces the concept of
induced supernova explosion in the supernovae-GRB association. These three
paradigms are illustrated using our theory based on the vacuum polarization
process occurring around an electromagnetic black hole (EMBH theory) and using
GRB 991216 as a prototype. We illustrate the five fundamental eras of the EMBH
theory: the self acceleration of the $e^+e^-$ pair-electromagnetic plasma (PEM
pulse), its interaction with the baryonic remnant of the progenitor star (PEMB
pulse). We then study the approach of the PEMB pulse to transparency, the
emission of the proper GRB (P-GRB) and its relation to the ``short GRBs''.
Finally the three different regimes of the afterglow are described within the
fully radiative and radial approximations. The best fit of the theory leads to
an unequivocal identification of the ``long GRBs'' as extended emission
occurring at the afterglow peak (E-APE). The relative intensities, the time
separation and the hardness ratio of the P-GRB and the E-APE are used as
distinctive observational test of the EMBH theory and the excellent agreement
between our theoretical predictions and the observations are documented. The
afterglow power-law indexes in the EMBH theory are compared and contrasted with
the ones in the literature, and no beaming process is found for GRB 991216.

the average and the rms timedelay for particles of given energy; we discuss
when particles of identical energies reach the Earth in bunches, or spread over

transverse correlation function on these scales is in good agreement with those
expected from absorption by the photoionized warm intergalactic medium

redshift of the galaxy coincides with the center of the absorption system,
although the absorption components span more than 100 km/s in either direction.
However, once the sense of the rotation is taken into account, there is no
absorbing gas at the projected velocity of the disk rotation curve. This

luminous than previously reported in the literature. Analysis of the absorption
lines shows evidence for superbubbles in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the
absorbing galaxy, based on the striking symmetry between components and large
MgI/MgII and MgI/FeII ratios, indicative of large densities. The large velocity
separations between line pairings, dv ~ 150 km/s indicates that these bubbles
may be powered by OB associations comparable to the largest observed at z=0 and

of the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mkn 766. The 3-11 keV spectrum exhibits a
moderately steep power law continuum, with a broad emission line at ~6.7 keV,
probably blended with a narrow line at ~6.4 keV, and a broad absorption trough
above ~8.7 keV. We identify both broad spectral features with reprocessing in
He-like Fe. An earlier XMM-Newton observation of Mkn 766 in 2000 May, when the
source was a factor ~2 fainter, shows a similar broad emission line, but with a
slightly flatter power law and absorption at a lower energy. In neither
observation do we find a requirement for the previously reported broad 'red
wing' to the line and hence of reflection from the innermost accretion disc.
More detailed examination of the longer XMM-Newton observation reveals evidence
for rapid spectral variability in the Fe K band, apparently linked with the
occurrence of X-ray 'flares'. A reduction in the emission line strength and
increased high energy absorption during the X-ray flaring suggests that these
transient effects are due to highly ionised ejecta associated with the flares.
Simple scaling from the flare avalanche model proposed for the luminous QSO PDS
456 (Reeves etal. 2002) confirms the feasibility of coherent flaring being the
cause of the strong peaks seen in the X-ray light curve of \mkn.

low ionization lines such as O III] 1662, while faster shocks (~180 km s^-1)
produce the O VI 1032,1038 and other high ionization lines. C III and O VI

larger than the characteristic X-ray pressure in the Vela SNR. The velocity
distribution of the emission and the overpressure support the idea that Knot D
is a bow shock around a bullet or cloud that originated near the center of the

magnetic fields such that the mean separation between flux-lines is smaller
than the penetration length. For pure systems, a first order transition from a
flux-line solid to a liquid phase is seen as the temperature is increased. When
adding columnar defects to the system, the transition temperature is not
affected in both materials as long as the strength of an individual columnar
defect (expressed as a flux-line defect interaction) is less than a certain
threshold for a given density of randomly distributed columnar pins. This
threshold strength is lower for YBCO than for BSCCO. For higher strengths the
transition line is shifted for both materials towards higher temperatures, and
the sharp jump in energy, characteristic of a first order transition, gives way
to a smoother and gradual rise of the energy, characteristic of a second order
transition. Also, when columnar defects are present, the vortex solid phase is
replaced by a pinned Bose glass phase and this is manifested by a marked
decrease in translational order and orientational order as measured by the
appropriate structure factors. For BSCCO, we report an unusual rise of the
translational order and the hexatic order just before the melting transition.

experimentally achieved in 1995 following decades of research. An avalanche of
experiment and theory has followed, leading to the awarding of the 2001 Nobel
Prizes in Physics to three of the pioneering experimentalists. Theory, mostly
couched in the language and formalism of condensed matter physics, has
developed apace. What we point out here is that a condensate in a double well
trap may be thought of exactly as a diatomic molecule with delocalized
molecular orbitals (MOs) filled with Bosons, rather than electrons. As in
quantum chemistry, configuration interaction must be included to supplement the
MO picture if dissociation is to be correctly described. Such dissociation is
called condensate fragmentation in the condensed matter theory literature.
Natural orbitals and their occupation numbers provide a clear and succinct way
of determining where the atoms are in highly correlated states as fragmentation
occurs, and are particularly helpful in understanding what is actually
happening when energy levels with macroscopic occupancy cross as a function of
breaking the symmetry between the trap wells. It is seen that only a few
particles are actually active in the level crossing. Recent experiments in
super-conductive Josephson loops showing tunneling of macroscopic quantum
states are easily included in this picture.

agreement with recent suggestions, we find that the SDW wave-vector ${\bf Q}$
deviates from its quantized value near the transition temperature $T_c$ for all
phases with quantum numbers $N>0$. Deviations from quantization are more
pronounced at low pressure and higher $N$ and may lead to a suppression of the
first-order transitions $N+1\to N$ for $N\ge 5$. Below a critical pressure, we
find that the N=0 phase invades the entire phase diagram in accordance with
earlier experiments. We also show that at T=0, the quantization of ${\bf Q}$
and hence the Hall conductance is always exact. Our results suggest a novel
phase transition/crossover at intermediate temperatures between phases with
quantized and non-quantized ${\bf Q}$.

non-linearly realized symmetries. The basic scenario with a single

scale to be above the Planck scale, which is beyond the range of validity of
the field theory description, so that quantum gravity corrections are not under

consider simple extensions in extra-dimensional setups. We also consider the
minimal structures necessary to obtain purely four-dimensional models with
spontaneous breaking scale below M_P; we show that they require an approximate

have been taken at the cooler synchrotron COSY in proton-proton scattering. In
the kaon--hyperon production an enhancement by one order of magnitude of the
Lambda/Sigma0 ratio has been observed at excess energies below Q=13 MeV
compared to data at higher excess energies (Q>300 MeV). New results obtained at
the COSY-11 facility explore the transition region between the regime of this
low-energy Sigma0 suppression and excess energies of 60 MeV. A comparison of
the energy dependence of the Lambda and Sigma0 total cross sections exhibits
distinct qualitative differences between both hyperon production channels.
Studies of kaon-antikaon production have been motivated especially by the
ongoing discussion about the nature of the scalar resonances f0(980) and
a0(980) coupling to the K anti-K channel. For the reaction pp->ppK+K- a first
total cross section value is reported at an excess energy of Q=17 MeV, i.e.
below the phi threshold. Calculations obtained within an OBE model indicate
that the energy dependence of the available total cross section data close to
threshold is rather difficult to reconcile with the assumption of a phase-space
behaviour modified predominantly by the proton-proton final state interaction.

dynamics of N-body interactions has been adapted to investigate the head-on
collision of two identical bound clusters of particles, and the ensuing process
of fragmentation. The range of impact energies is chosen low enough, to secure
that a compound bound cluster can be formed. The model is devised to simulate
the laboratory set-up of fragmentation experiments as monitored by 4pi
detectors. The particles interact via a Lennard-Jones potential. At low impact
energies the numerical experiments following the dynamics of the individual
particles indicate a phase of energy sharing among all the particles of the
compound cluster. Fragments of all sizes are then found to evaporate from the
latter cluster. The cluster sizes, measured in our set-up by simulated 4pi
detectors, conform to a power law of exponent around 2.6.

wave function of the particle experiencing Raman excitation is found as an
expansion in terms of the time varying nonadiabatic perturbation parameter. The
solution can be presented as a sum of adiabatic and nonadiabatic parts. Both
are estimated quantitatively. It is shown that the limiting value to which the
amplitude of the nonadiabatic part tends is equal to the Fourier component of
the nonadiabatic perturbation parameter taken at the Rabi frequency of the
Raman excitation. The time scale of the variation of both parts is found. While
the adiabatic part of the solution varies slowly and follows the change of the
nonadiabatic perturbation parameter, the nonadiabatic part appears almost
instantly, revealing a jumpwise transition between the dark and bright states.
This jump happens when the nonadiabatic perturbation parameter takes its
maximum value.

approximation ignoring the turbulent fluctuations employed by traditional
transition theories could overestimate the range where hysteresis is observed
and statistical analyses are inevitably needed.

relates to the axiomatic conception of quantum phenomena (ACQP), (i.e. to the
conventional quantum mechanics) in the same way, as the statistical physics
relates to thermodynamics. Such a possibility is based on a new conception of
geometry, which admits one to construct such a deterministic space-time
geometry, where motion of free particles is primordially stochastic. The
space-time geometry can be chosen in such a way that statistical description of
random particle motion coincides with the quantum description. Methods of MCQP
in investigation of quantum phenomena appear to be more subtle and effective
than, that of ACQP. For instance, investigation of the free Dirac equation in
framework of MCQP shows that the Dirac particle is in reality a rotator, i.e.
two particles rotating around their common center of inertia. In the framework
of MCQP one can discover the force field, responsible for pair production, that
is impossible in the framework of ACQP.

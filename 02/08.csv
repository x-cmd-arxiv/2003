spectroscopy of these two objects yield z=3.087+-0.004. The brightest (K=18.8)

the AGN, which implies a one-sided jet radio morphology. Deep 113 GHz
observations with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer reveal CO J=4-3
emission, which peaks at the position of the AGN. The CO line is offset by 500
km/s from the systemic redshift of the AGN, but corresponds very closely to the
velocity shift of an associated HI absorber seen in Lya. This strongly suggests
that both originate from the same gas reservoir surrounding the AGN host
galaxy. Simultaneous 230 GHz interferometer observations find a ~3x lower
integrated flux density when compared to single dish 250 GHz observations with
MAMBO at the IRAM 30m telescope. This can be interpreted as spatially resolved
thermal dust emission at scales of 0.5"" to 6"". Finally, we present a tau <1.3%
limit to the HI 21 cm absorption against the radio source, which represents the
seventh non-detection out of 8 z>2 radio galaxies observed to date with the

and for the dust, ranging from M(HI)=2x10^7 M_Sun derived from the associated
HI absorber in Lya up to M(H_2)=7x10^{10} M_Sun derived from the CO emission.
This indicates that the host galaxy is surrounded by a massive reservoir of gas
and dust. The K-band companion objects may be concentrations within this
reservoir, which will eventually merge with the central galaxy hosting the AGN.

of very small dust particles is calculated consistently with the radiative
transfer. The adopted dust model consists of graphite and silicate grains and
PAHs, whose relative fractions are determined for each MW, LMC and SMC type
extinction curve. This model allows us to derive the intrinsic SEDs of stellar
populations embedded in dusty ISM, which are very important indicators for the
age of stellar populations. Therefore, the evolutionary phase of starburst
galaxies which have frequently very dusty ISM can be investigated with this SED
model. We show that the SEDs of Arp220 and M82 can both be explained by the
same single stellar population, despite the significant differences in the SEDs
and the infrared luminosities. The apparent difference between their SEDs is
mainly caused by the difference in the optical depth. In contrast, the SED of
prototypical star-forming ERO, HR10, indicates that this galaxy is relatively
old comparing to Arp220 and M82. It is found that, in the case of optically
thin limit like elliptical galaxies, the optical depth cannot be inferred only
from the SED, due to a degeneracy between the optical depth, galactic size, and
the spatial distribution of dust; the latter two are important for estimating
the average temperature of dust grains in elliptical galaxies. When the
observed size of elliptical galaxies is adopted for the model geometry, SEDs
can be used to constrain the spatial distribution of dust in elliptical
galaxies.

that occultation surveys may be best suited to search for a turnover radius in

occultation surveys that monitor stellar sources near the ecliptic over a few
square degrees, with time sampling intervals of order 0.1 sec and sensitivity
to flux variations of a few percent or more, a turnover radius between 0.1 and
1.0 km can be probed. While occultation surveys will probe the low-radius limit

in the gas falling within a spherical dark-matter halo. The shock relies on
pressure support by the shock-heated gas behind it. When the radiative cooling
is efficient compared to the infall rate the post-shock gas becomes unstable;
it collapses inwards and cannot support the shock.
  We find for a monoatomic gas that the shock is stable when the post-shock
pressure and density obey gamma effective>10/7, with gamma effective begin the
time depended equivalent to the adiabatic index. We express the effective gamma
in terms of r, u and rho at the shock to obtain a simple condition for shock
stability. This result is confirmed by hydrodynamical simulations, using an
accurate spheri-symmetric Lagrangian code. When the stability analysis is
applied in cosmology, we find that a virial shock does not develop in most
haloes that form before z ~ 2, and it never forms in haloes less massive than a
few 10^11 solar masses. In such haloes the infalling gas is never heated to the
virial temperature, and it does not need to cool radiatively before it drops
into a disc. Instead, the gas collapses at T ~ 10^4K directly into the disc.
This should have nontrivial effects on the star-formation rate and on the gas
removal by supernova-driven winds. Instead of radiating soft x rays, this gas
would emit lyman alpha thus helping explain the low flux of soft x-ray
background and the lyman alpha emitters observed at high redshift.

about the fixed-points of the theory. We show that the effect of increasing the
number N of subbands at the Fermi level is opposite to that of approaching the
bare Coulomb interaction in the limit D --> 1. Then, we devise a double scaling
limit, in which the large N effects are able to tame the singularities due to
the long-range interaction. Thus, regular expressions can be obtained for all
observables right at D = 1, bearing also a dependence o the doping level of the
system. Our results imply a variation with N in the value of the exponent for
the tunneling density of states, which is in fair agreement with that observed
in different transport experiments involving carbon nanotubes. As the doping
level is increased in nanotubes of large radius and multi-walled nanotubes, we
predict a significant reduction of order N^{-1/2} in the critical exponent of

transition from a region in the space of control parameters in which almost all
instances have many solutions to a region in which almost all instances have no
solution, is investigated by examining the energy landscape of this classic
optimization problem. This is achieved by coding the information about the
minimum energy paths connecting pairs of minima into a tree structure, termed a
barrier tree, the leaves and internal nodes of which represent, respectively,
the minima and the lowest energy saddles connecting those minima. Here we apply
several measures of shape (balance and symmetry) as well as of branch lengths
(barrier heights) to the barrier trees that result from the landscape of the
NPP, aiming at identifying traces of the easy/hard transition. We find that it
is not possible to tell the easy regime from the hard one by visual inspection
of the trees or by measuring the barrier heights. Only the {\it difficulty}
measure, given by the maximum value of the ratio between the barrier height and
the energy surplus of local minima, succeeded in detecting traces of the phase
transition in the tree. In adddition, we show that the barrier trees associated
with the NPP are very similar to random trees, contrasting dramatically with
trees associated with the $p$ spin-glass and random energy models. We also

flavor violating decays \mu \to e + \gamma, \tau \to \mu + \gamma and \tau \to
e + \gamma are considered and a characteristic relation between their decay

decay depends on the CP violating phase controlling the leptogenesis if one of

leptogenesis requires a rather mild mass hierarchy between the latter. The

Soc. 296 (2002), 183-198",,,"math.GR math.GT",,"  The Andrews-Curtis conjecture claims that every balanced presentation of the
trivial group can be reduced to the standard one by a sequence of ``elementary
transformations"" which are Nielsen transformations augmented by arbitrary
conjugations. It is a prevalent opinion that this conjecture is false; however,
not many potential counterexamples are known. In this paper, we show that some
of the previously proposed examples are actually not counterexamples. We hope
that the tricks we used in constructing relevant chains of elementary
transformations will be useful to those who attempt to establish the
Andrews-Curtis equivalence in other situations.
  On the other hand, we give two rather general and simple methods for
constructing balanced presentations of the trivial group; some of these
presentations can be considered potential counterexamples to the Andrews-Curtis
conjecture. One of the methods is based on a simple combinatorial idea of
composition of group presentations, whereas the other one uses ""exotic"" knot
diagrams of the unknot.
  We also consider the Andrews-Curtis equivalence in metabelian groups and
reveal some interesting connections of relevant problems to well-known problems
in K-theory.

although formed from a pair of zero-momentum condensate atoms, a condensate
molecule need not dissociate back to the BEC, but may just as well form a
noncondensate atom pair with equal and opposite momentum, i.e., due to rogue
photodissociation. The uncorrelated frequency shift of the photoassociation
spectrum is to the red and linearly dependent on the laser intensity. In
contrast, anomalous correlations due to rogue dissociation lead to a
blueshifted photoassociation spectrum. For sufficiently low light intensities,
the rogue blueshift is dominant and proportional to the squareroot of
intensity.

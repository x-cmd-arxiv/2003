about 0.5 Gigayears after the Big-Bang by a cosmic ray-driven dynamo. These
objects experience a phase of strong star formation during this first $10^9$
years. We transfer the knowledge of the connection between star formation and
the production rate of cosmic rays by supernova remnants to such high redshift
objects. Since the supernova rate is a direct measure for the production rate
of cosmic rays we conclude that very young galaxies must be strong sources of
cosmic rays. The key argument of our model is the finding that magnetic fields
and cosmic rays are dynamically coupled, i.e. a strong cosmic ray source
contains strong magnetic fields since the relativistic particles drive an
efficient dynamo in a galaxy via their buoyancy. We construct a
phenomenological model of a dynamo driven by buoyancy of cosmic rays and show
that if azimuthal shearing is strong enough the dynamo amplification timescale
is close to the buoyancy timescale of the order of several $10^7 \div 10^8$ yr.
We predict that young galaxies are strongly magnetized and may contribute
significantly to the gamma-ray-background.

regions by the end of the ASCA mission. We detected 106 discrete sources with a
criterion of S/N > 5 and performed systematic analyses on all of the sources.
We determined the source positions with an ~40'' error radius (90% confidence)
for sources detected in the central 20' radius of the GIS. We detected coherent
pulsations from 17 sources. Among them, eight were newly discovered during this
study. We classified most of these pulsars as X-ray binary pulsars (XBPs) based
on their properties, such as the flux variability and the existence of an
optical counterpart. We detected X-ray emission from eight supernova remnants
(SNRs). Among them, five SNRs showed emission lines in their spectra, hence we
regarded the five as thermal SNRs. We found that XBPs and thermal SNRs in the
SMC can be clearly separated by their spectral hardness ratio. Applying this
empirical law to faint (thus unclassified) sources, we found 19 XBP candidates
and four thermal SNR candidates. We also found several tens of candidates for
active galactic nuclei, both from the hardness ratio and the logN--logS
relation of extragalactic sources. Based on these ASCA results and further
information from other sattelites, we compiled comprehensive catalogues of
discrete X-ray sources in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Using the catalogues, we
derived the spatial distributions of XBPs and SNRs. XBPs and SNRs were found to
be concentrated in the main body and eastern wing, which resembles the
distribution of young stars with ages of ~2e7yr. By comparing the source
populations in the SMC and our Galaxy, we suggest that the star-forming rate
(per unit mass) in the SMC was much higher than the Galaxy 1e7yr ago. We also
discuss the recent change of the star-forming rate in the SMC.

um ISAAC and TIMMI2 images of the extreme OH/IR star IRAS 16342-3814. Amorphous
silicate absorption features are seen, together with crystalline silicate
absorption features up to almost 45 um. No other OH/IR star is known to have
crystalline silicate features in absorption up to these wavelengths. This
suggests that IRAS 16342-3814 must have, or recently had, an extremely high
mass-loss rate. Preliminary radiative transfer calculations suggest that the
mass-loss rate may be as large as 10^{-3} Msun/yr. The 3.8 um ISAAC image shows
a bipolar reflection nebula with a dark equatorial waist or torus, similar to
that seen in optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. The position angle of
the nebula decreases significantly with increasing wavelength, suggesting that
the dominant source of emission changes from scattering to thermal emission.
Still, even up to 20 um the nebula is oriented approximately along the major
axis of the nebula seen in the HST and ISAAC images, suggesting that the torus
must be very cold, in agreement with the very red ISO spectrum. The 20 um image
shows a roughly spherically symmetric extended halo, approximately 6'' in
diameter, which is probably due to a previous phase of mass-loss on the AGB,
suggesting a transition from a (more) spherically symmetric to a (more) axial
symmetric form of mass-loss at the end of the AGB. We estimate the maximum dust
particle sizes in the torus and in the reflection nebula to be 1.3 and 0.09 um
respectively. The size of the particles in the torus is large compared to
typical ISM values, but in agreement with high mass-loss rate objects like AFGL
4106 and HD161796. We discuss the possible reason for the difference in

This can occur without violating classical general relativity anywhere
experimentally accessible to external observers. Since the low-energy effects
that occur at critical points are universal, it is possible to make concrete
experimental predictions about such surfaces without knowing much, if anything
about the true underlying equations. Many of these predictions are different
from accepted views about black holes - in particular the absence of Hawking

physical limits on how closely can a quantum mechanical system be steered to a
desired target state in the presence of relaxation. In particular, we
explicitly compute the maximum coherence or polarization that can be
transferred between coupled nuclear spins in the presence of very general
decoherence mechanisms that include cross-correlated relaxation. We give
analytical expressions for the control laws (pulse sequences) which achieve
these physical limits and provide supporting experimental evidence.
Exploitation of cross-correlation effects has recently led to the development
of powerful methods in NMR spectroscopy to study very large biomolecules in

provide significant gains over these state of the art methods, opening new
avenues for spectroscopy of much larger proteins. Surprisingly, in spite of
very large relaxation rates, optimal control can transfer coherence without any
loss when cross-correlated relaxation rates are tuned to auto-correlated

we compare with the COBE data to infer a normalization (or upper bound) on the

($\Omega_{M}=1$) we find $G\mu/c^2 \approx 0.7\times 10^{-6}$, which is lower
than previous constraints probably because of the more accurate inclusion of
string small-scale structure. For a cosmological constant within an
observationally acceptable range, we find a relatively weak dependence with

that previously derived limits on the parameters of the potential in this model

the background radiation component. An initial quintessence energy density
above this equipartition value lead to a solution that will not have joined the

rejuvenates the overall magnetic field continuously, and also allows to
understand that there is a regular field at all in disk galaxies. This proposal

the rapid bluing from the late L to the early T dwarfs is a direct result of

structure from the 7C redshift survey (7CRS). A second, newly discovered

galaxies, at least 25 are associated with the two super-structures. We use
quasi-linear structure formation theory to estimate the number of such

galaxy bias is assumed. Under this assumption, the structures represent ~ 4-5
sigma peaks in the primordial density field and their expected number is low
(10^{-2}-10^{-4}). Fortunately, there are several plausible explanations (many
of which are testable) for these low probabilities in the form of potential
mechanisms for boosting the bias on large scales. These include: the
association of radio galaxies with highly biased rich clusters in
super-structures, enhanced triggering by group/group mergers, and enhanced
triggering and/or redshift space distortion in collapsing systems as the growth
of super-structures moves into the non-linear regime. Similar structures could
have been missed in previous surveys because of the effects of Poisson-sampling

and potential of a stellar system. For general three-dimensional stellar
systems, there are three equations and six independent moments. By assuming
that the potential is triaxial and of separable Staeckel form, the mixed
moments vanish in confocal ellipsoidal coordinates. Consequently, the three
Jeans equations and three remaining non-vanishing moments form a closed system
of three highly-symmetric coupled first-order partial differential equations in
three variables. These equations were first derived by Lynden-Bell, over 40
years ago, but have resisted solution by standard methods. We present the
general solution here.
  We consider the two-dimensional limiting cases first. We solve their Jeans
equations by a new method which superposes singular solutions. The singular
solutions, which are new, are standard Riemann-Green functions. The
two-dimensional solutions are applied to non-axisymmetric discs, oblate and
prolate spheroids, and also to the scale-free triaxial limit. We then extend
the method of singular solutions to the triaxial case, and obtain a full
solution. The general solution can be expressed in terms of complete
(hyper)elliptic integrals which can be evaluated in a straightforward way, and
provides the full set of second moments which can support a triaxial density
distribution in a separable triaxial potential. (abridged)

in conjunction with the random series implementation of the Feynman-Kac
formula. I prove several convergence results valid for all series
representations and then I specialize the results for the Levy-Ciesielski and
Wiener-Fourier series. As opposed to the partial averaging method on which they
are based, the reweighted techniques do not involve any modification of the
physical potential. Rather, the underlying idea is to develop some specialized
constructions of the Brownian bridge that enters the Feynman-Kac formula, so as
to simulate the partial averaging effect. For the Levy-Ciesielski series
representation, I develop a reweighted technique which has o(1/n^2) convergence
for potentials having first order Sobolev derivatives. It is suggested that the
asymptotic convergence may reach O(1/n^3) for potentials having second order
Sobolev derivatives. The method preserves the favorable log(n) scaling for the
time necessary to compute a path at a given discretization point. For the
Wiener-Fourier series representation, the particular reweighted method designed
in the present article is shown to have O(1/n^3) convergence if the potential
has second order Sobolev derivatives. The convergence constant has superior
dependence with the inverse temperature as compared to the partial averaging
method for the same series. Because the expression of the convergence constant
does not actually involve the second order derivatives of the potential, it is
conjectured that the O(1/n^3) convergence extends to the potentials having
first order Sobolev derivatives only.

First, the modulus of the vortex velocity becomes angular dependent with a
lower mobility along the diagonals of the pinning array. Second, the vortex
displacement is preferentially parallel to the principal axes of the underlying

account for the effects of strong correlation. We find that, as expected, the
self-interaction is not strong in (Ga,Mn)As, because the Fermi energy is
crossed by weakly correlated As p - Mn d hybridized bands and the Mn 3d
character is distributed through the whole valence band manifold. This result
validates the extensive literature of LSDA studies on (Ga,Mn)As, including the
conclusion that the ferromagnetism is hole-mediated. In contrast, the LSDA
gives a qualitatively incorrect band structure for (Ga,Mn)N, which is
characterized by localized Mn 3d bands with very strong self-interaction. Our
pseudo-SIC calculations show a highly confined hole just above the Fermi energy
in the majority band manifold. Such a band arrangement is consistent with
(although by no means conclusive evidence for) a recent suggestion that
formation of Zhang-Rice magnetic polarons is responsible for hole-mediated
ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)N.

modes or lighter matter) is introduced as a perturbation and it is seen that
its presence requires the coarse averaging of a gravitational wave function
(which oscillates at trans-Planckian frequencies) having suitable initial
conditions. Such a wave function, which is common for all types of normal
matter, is associated with a ``time density'' in the sense that its modulus is
related to the amount of time spent in a given interval (or the rate of flow of
time). One is then finally led to an effective evolution equation (Schroedinger
Schwinger-Tomonaga) for ``normal'' matter. An analogy with the emergence of a

with the parity conditions, are preserved by the energy-momentum conservation
and the evolution equations. The algebra of the asymptotic Killing vectors,
defined with respect to a foliation of the spacetime, is shown to be the
Lorentz Lie algebra for slow fall-off of the metric, but it is the Poincare
algebra for 1/r or faster fall-off. It is shown that the applicability of the

often prevents the generation of Majorana masses needed for a conventional
neutrino seesaw, leading to three superweakly interacting ``right-handed''
neutrinos nu_R, the Dirac partners of the ordinary neutrinos. These can be
produced prior to big bang nucleosynthesis by the Z' interactions, leading to a
faster expansion rate and too much ^4He. We quantify the constraints on the Z'
properties from nucleosynthesis for Z' couplings motivated by a class of E_6
models parametrized by an angle theta_E6. The rate for the annihilation of
three approximately massless right-handed neutrinos into other particle pairs
through the Z' channel is calculated. The decoupling temperature, which is
higher than that of ordinary left-handed neutrinos due to the large Z' mass, is
evaluated, and the equivalent number of new doublet neutrinos Delta N_nu is
obtained numerically as a function of the Z' mass and couplings for a variety
of assumptions concerning the Z-Z' mixing angle and the quark-hadron transition
temperature T_c. Except near the values of theta_E6 for which the Z' decouples
from the right-handed neutrinos, the Z' mass and mixing constraints from
nucleosynthesis are much more stringent than the existing laboratory limits
from searches for direct production or from precision electroweak data, and are
comparable to the ranges that may ultimately be probed at proposed colliders.
For the case T_c = 150 MeV with the theoretically favored range of Z-Z'
mixings, Delta N_nu < 0.3 for M_Z' > 4.3 TeV for any value of theta_E6. Larger
mixing or larger T_c often lead to unacceptably large Delta N_nu except near

and for all initial data $u_0$ sufficiently close to 1 (up to a global phase
factor $\ed^{i \phi_0}, \phi_0\in{\bf R}$) in the appropriate space, there

the author uses well known in classical algebraic geometry degeneration

using the p(21Ne,t)19Ne reaction at 43 MeV/u. Combining our branching ratio

inspired by Lattice QCD calculations and reproduces the average energy values
of the SU(6) multiplets. The splittings within each multiplet are obtained with
a SU(6)-breaking interaction, which can include also an isospin dependent term.
All the 3- and 4-stars resonances are well reproduced. Moreover, as all the
Constituent Quark models, the hCQM predicts ``missing'' resonances ({\em e.g.}
extra $S11$ and $P13$ states) which can be of some help for the experimental
identification of new resonances. The model provides also a good description of
the medium $Q^2$-behavior of the electromagnetic transition form factors. In
particular the calculated helicity amplitude $A_{{1/2}}$ for the $S_{11}(1535)$
resonance agrees very well with the recent CLAS data. More recently, the
elastic nucleon form factors have been calculated using a relativistic version
of the hCQM and a relativistic quark current.

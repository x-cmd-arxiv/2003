formation regions: RCrA, Rho Ophiuchi, Serpens and Chamaeleon I. This survey
was performed using ISOCAM and its Circular Variable Filters (CVF) and observed
42 YSO candidates. A number of spectral features were measured, most notably
the 9.7um silicate feature, the bending modes of both water and CO2 ices at 6.0
and 15.2um respectively and the well-known unidentified feature at 6.8um. The
strength of the unidentified feature was observed to correlate very well with
that of the water ice bending mode and far less strongly with the CO2 ice
bending mode. This suggests, in a manner consistent with previous observations,
that the carrier of the unidentified feature is a strongly polar ice.
Absorption profiles of the bending mode of CO2 ice are observed to show a
significant long wavelength wing, which suggests that a significant fraction of
the CO2 ice observed exists in a polar (H2O-rich) phase. The sources observed
in RCrA, Rho Oph and Serpens show similar spectral characteristics, whilst the
sources observed in Cha I are somewhat anomalous. However this is consistent
with previous studies of this region of the Cha I cloud, which contains an
unusual cluster of YSOs. We detect an apparent under-abundance of water ice
towards the sources in Rho Oph. This may be indicative of differences in
chemical composition between the different clouds, or may be due to
evaporation. Finally the CO2:H2O ice ratios observed towards the sources in Rho
Oph show significantly greater scatter than in the other regions, possibly due
to varying local conditions around the YSOs in Rho Oph. (Abridged)

SRa and SRb (SRV), respectively, and 12 Miras. New observational material,
which contains data in several SiO rotational lines in the ground vibrational

fractional abundances have been determined through radiative transfer
modelling. The abundance distribution of the IRV/SRV sample has a median value
of 8E-6. The high mass loss rate Miras have a bimodal abundance distribution, a
low abundance group (on average 4E-7) and a high abundance group (on average
7E-6). The derived SiO abundances are in all cases well below the abundance
expected from stellar atmosphere chemistry, on average by a factor of ten. In
addition, there is a trend of decreasing SiO abundance with increasing mass
loss rate. This is interpreted in terms of depletion of SiO molecules by the
formation of silicate grains in the circumstellar envelopes, with an efficiency
which increases with the mass loss rate. The SiO and CO radio line profiles
differ in shape. In general, the dominating part of the SiO profiles are
narrower than the CO profiles, but they have low-intensity wings which cover
the full velocity range of the CO profile. This is interpreted (as has been
done also by others) as due to the influence of gas acceleration in the region
which produces a significant fraction of the SiO line emission. Finally, a
number of sources which have peculiar CO line profiles are discussed from the
point of view of their SiO line properties.

dominant foreground at 31.5 GHz. The result implies the presence of an emission

discuss the possible origins of this component and compare it with the recent

compression of fossil radio plasma during a merger between clusters. The
ensuing compression of the plasma can lead to a substantial increase in
synchrotron luminosity and this appears as a radio relic. Our simulations show
that relics are most likely to be found at the periphery of the cluster at the
positions of the outgoing merger shock waves. Relics are expected to be very
rare in the centre of the cluster where the life time of relativistic electrons
is short and shock waves are weaker than in the cooler, peripheral regions of

relativistic protons contribute significantly to the total pressure. Reasonable
contributions from low energy electrons and filling factors in the range 0.1 to

cumulative DLA abundance by using the relation between DLA cross-section and
the total halo mass inferred from the simulations. Our approach includes a
phenomenological model of galactic wind. We employ the ``conservative entropy''
formulation of SPH, and utilise a series of simulations of varying box-size and
particle number to isolate the impact of numerical resolution on our results.
We show that the DLA abundance was overestimated in previous studies for three
reasons: (1) the overcooling of gas occurring with non-conservative
formulations of SPH, (2) a lack of numerical resolution, and (3) an inadequate
treatment of feedback. Our new results for the total neutral hydrogen mass
density, DLA abundance, and column density distribution function all agree
reasonably well with observational estimates at redshift z=3, indicating that
DLAs arise naturally from radiatively cooled gas in dark matter haloes that
form in a Lambda CDM universe. Our simulations suggest a moderate decrease in
DLA abundance by roughly a factor of two from z=4.5 to 3, consistent with
observations. A significant decline in abundance from z=3 to z=1, followed by
weak evolution from z=1 to z=0, is also indicated, but our low-redshift results
need to be interpreted with caution because they are based on coarser
simulations than the ones employed at high redshift. Our highest resolution
simulation also suggests that the halo mass-scale below which DLAs do not exist
is slightly above 10^8 Msun/h at z=3-4, somewhat lower than previously
estimated. (abridged)

intranight variability of the radio-quiet quasars relative to BL Lacs can be
understood in terms of a modest misalignment of the jets in radio-quiet quasars

also emerge from radio-quiet quasars, but while traversing the short

explanations for such a small radius include a reduced X-ray emitting region
(as a polar cap), or the presence of a more compact object, as a bare
quark/strange star. However, both interpretations rely on the presumption that
the quark star or the cap radiates a pure blackbody spectrum, and no
justification for this assumption has been presented yet. Here we discuss an
alternative possibility. Cool neutron stars (T < 10^6 K) endowed with high
magnetic field (B > 10^13 G) may suffer a phase transition in the outermost
layers. The neutron star is then left bare of the gaseous atmosphere. We
computed spectra from naked neutron stars with a surface Fe composition.
Depending on B, we found that the 0.1-2 keV emission can be featureless and
indistinguishable from a blackbody. Owing to the reduced surface emissivity,
the star only radiates ~30-50 % of the blackbody power, thus that the size of
the emitting region is larger than for a perfect planckian emitter. When
applied to RX J1856.5-3754 our model accounts for the observed X-ray properties
and solves the paradox of the small radius. The apparent star radius is ~10-12
km, consistent with equations of state of a neutron star. The optical emission
of RX J1856.5-3754 may be explained by the presence a thin gaseous shell on the
top of the Fe condensate.

views of orbital 3D models for barred galaxies. Using orbital weighted profiles
we show that boxiness is in general a composite effect that appears when one
considers stable orbits belonging to several families of periodic orbits. 3D
orbits that are introduced due to vertical instabilities, play a crucial role
in the face-on profiles and enhance their rectangularity. This happens because
at the 4:1 radial resonance region we have several orbits with boxy face-on
projections, instead of few rectangular-like x1 orbits, which, in a fair
fraction of the models studied so far, are unstable at this region. Massive
bars are characterized by rectangular-like orbits. However, we find that it is
the pattern speed that affects most the elongation of the boxy feature, in the
sense that fast bars are more elongated than slow ones. Boxiness in
intermediate distances between the center of the model and the end of the bar
can be attributed to x1v1 orbits, or to a combination of families related to
the radial 3:1 resonance.

density. For $\Lambda =200$ nm we find that $\rho_{Drag}$ is solely due to
phonon exchange and shows no double-peak structure as a function of $B$. For
$\Lambda =30$ nm, $\rho_{Drag}$ shows the double-peak structure and is mainly
due to Coulomb interaction. The value of $\rho_{Drag}$ is about 0.3 $\Omega $
at T=2 K and for the half-filled second Lanadau level, which is about 13 times
larger than the value for $\Lambda =200$ nm. At lower edge of the temperature
interval from 0.1 to 8 K, $\rho_{Drag}/ T^{2}$ remains finite for $\Lambda =30$

different magnetic field and temperature dependence of $\rho_{Drag}$ ascribe we
mainly to the weak screening effect at large interlayer separations.

showed that the enhancement of this tunable pairing interaction naturally leads
to the BCS-BEC crossover, where the character of the superfluid phase
transition changes from the BCS-type to a BEC of composite bosons consisting of
preformed Cooper-pairs and Feshbach-induced molecules. In this paper, we extend
our previous work and study both single quasi-particles and the collective
dynamics of the superfluid phase below Tc. We show how the superfluid order
parameter changes from the Cooper-pair amplitude to the square root of the
number of condensed molecules associated with the Feshbach resonance, as the

contact dependence of the noise could help to distinguish ballistic chaotic

subtract monomer units at their live chain ends. The classic example is ionic
living polymerization. In equilibrium, a delicate balance is maintained in
which each initiated chain has a very small negative average growth rate
(``velocity'') just sufficient to negate the effect of growth rate
fluctuations. This leads to an exponential molecular weight distribution (MWD)
with mean Nbar. After a small perturbation of relative amplitude epsilon, e.g.
a small temperature jump, this balance is destroyed: the velocity acquires a
boost greatly exceeding its tiny equilibrium value. For epsilon > epsilon_c =
1/Nbar^{1/2} the response has 3 stages: (1) Coherent chain growth or shrinkage,
leaving a highly non-linear hole or peak in the MWD at small chain lengths.
During this episode, lasting time taufast ~ Nbar, the MWD's first moment and
monomer concentration m relax very close to equilibrium. (2) Hole-filling (or
peak decay) after taufill ~ epsilon^2 Nbar^2. The absence or surfeit of small
chains is erased. (3) Global MWD shape relaxation after tauslow ~ Nbar^2. By
this time second and higher MWD moments have relaxed. During episodes (2) and
(3) the fast variables (Nbar,m) are enslaved to the slowly varying number of
free initiators (chains of zero length). Thus fast variables are
quasi-statically fine-tuned to equilibrium. The outstanding feature of these
dynamics is their ultrasensitivity: despite the perturbation's linearity, the
response is non-linear until the late episode (3). For very small
perturbations, epsilon < epsilon_c, response remains non-linear but with a less
dramatic peak or hole during episode (1). Our predictions are in agreement with
viscosity measurements on the most widely studied system, alpha-methylstyrene.

Foster and O Murchadha (BFO)'s 3-space formulation of GR. This is based on
best-matched lapse-eliminated actions and gives rise to several theories
including GR and a conformal gravity theory. We study the simplicity postulates
assumed in BFO's work and how to weaken them, so as to permit the inclusion of
the full set of matter fields known to occur in nature.
  We study the configuration spaces of gravity-matter systems upon which BFO's
formulation leans. In further developments the lapse-eliminated actions used by
BFO become impractical and require generalization. We circumvent many of these
problems by the equivalent use of lapse-uneliminated actions, which furthermore
permit us to interpret BFO's formulation within Kuchar's generally covariant
hypersurface framework. This viewpoint provides alternative reasons to BFO's as
to why the inclusion of bosonic fields in the 3-space approach gives rise to
minimally-coupled scalar fields, electromagnetism and Yang--Mills theory. This
viewpoint also permits us to quickly exhibit further GR-matter theories
admitted by the 3-space formulation. In particular, we show that the spin-1/2
fermions of the theories of Dirac, Maxwell--Dirac and Yang--Mills--Dirac, all
coupled to GR, are admitted by the generalized 3-space formulation we present.
Thus all the known fundamental matter fields can be accommodated. This
corresponds to being able to pick actions for all these theories which have
less kinematics than suggested by the generally covariant hypersurface
framework. For all these theories, Wheeler's thin sandwich conjecture may be
posed, rendering them timeless in Barbour's sense.

from the wave-function profile in an extra dimension. Unlike the
Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, the SO(10) breaking effect may directly contribute
to the source of the hierarchy, i.e., the bulk mass terms. It naturally
explains the difference of the hierarchical patterns between the quark and the
lepton sectors. We also find the possibility of the horizontal unification, in
which three generations of the matter fields are unified to a 3 dimensional
representation of an SU(2) gauge group.

considering hybrid brane inflation without tachyon condensation. We expect that
some fields that are localized on different branes interact with O(1) coupling
when branes are on top of each other, while the interaction vanishes when
branes are separated at a distance. If the interaction is needed to avoid
spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry on the brane, our idea for hybrid brane
inflation works. In our model, when branes are far apart, supersymmetry is
spontaneously broken by the fields on a brane, which induces inflation. The
inflaton field is the moduli for the brane distance. At the end of inflation,
when branes come close, supersymmetry is restored by the interaction between
fields on the branes, then the oscillation starts to reheat the Universe. In
this paper we construct explicit models for F-term and D-term inflation. There
are at least two major advantages. The most attractive point is that reheating
is natural in our model, because the trigger field is not the tachyon but a
conventional field on the brane. The serious constraint from the loop
correction, which always appears in conventional models for hybrid inflation,
is avoided.

construct specific examples in which the curvature corresponding
$g_{ab}(x^i;\lambda)$ becomes a Dirac delta function and gets concentrated on
the horizon when the limit $\lambda\to 0$ is taken, but the action remains
finite. When the horizon is interpreted in this manner, one needs to remove the

how the mediating spacetime topology, or cobordism, may be simplified through

that any topology change in dimensions $\geq 5$ may be achieved via a causally
continuous cobordism. This extends the known result for 4 dimensions.
Therefore, there is no selection rule for compactification at the level of
causal continuity. Theorems from surgery theory and handle theory are seen to
be very relevant for understanding topology change in higher dimensions.
Compactification via parallelisable cobordisms is particularly amenable to

  In chapter 2 we recall the classical definition of the holomorph as well as
this universal property, and give some group theoretic properties and examples
of holomorphs. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for
the existence of a map of split extensions for holomorphs of two groups.
  In chapter 3 we construct a resolution for $Hol(Z_{p^r})$ for every prime
$p$, where ${\mathbb Z}_m$ denotes a cyclic group of order $m$, and use it to
compute the integer homology and mod $p$ cohomology ring of $Hol(Z_{p^r})$.
  In chapter 4 we study the holomorph of the direct sum of several copies of
$Z_{p^r}$. We identify this holomorph as a nice subgroup of $GL(n+1, Z_{p^r})$,
thus its cohomology informs on the cohomology of the general linear group which
has been of interest in the subject. We show that the LHS spectral sequence for
$H^*(Hol(\bigoplus_n Z_{p^r}); F_p)$ does not collapse at the $E_2$ stage for

neutron-rich 112Sn target. The data demonstrate the significant effect of the
target neutron-to-proton ratio (N/Z) in peripheral collisions at Fermi
energies. A hybrid model based on a deep-inelastic transfer code (DIT) followed
by a statistical de-excitation code appears to account for part of the observed
large cross sections. The DIT simulation indicates that the production of the
neutron-rich nuclides in these reactions is associated with peripheral nucleon
exchange. In such peripheral encounters, the neutron skins of the neutron-rich
124Sn and 64Ni target nuclei may play an important role. From a practical
viewpoint, such reactions between massive neutron-rich nuclei offer a novel and
attractive synthetic avenue to access extremely neutron-rich rare isotopes
towards the neutron-drip line.

of the early evolution of the genomes. The frequencies of word occurrence of
random DNA sequences considered as texts in their four nucleotides are expected
to obey Poisson distributions. It is noticed that for words less than nine
letters the average width of the distributions for complete microbial genomes
is many times that of a Poisson distribution. We interpret this phenomenon as
follows: the genome is a large system that possesses the statistical
characteristics of a much smaller ``random'' system, and certain textual
statistical properties of genomes we now see are remnants of those of their
ancestral genomes, which were much shorter than the genomes are now. This
interpretation suggests a simple biologically plausible model for the growth of
genomes: the genome first grows randomly to an initial length of approximately
one thousand nucleotides (1k nt), or about one thousandth of its final length,
thereafter mainly grows by random segmental duplication. We show that using
duplicated segments averaging around 25 nt, the model sequences generated
possess statistical properties characteristic of present day genomes. Both the
initial length and the duplicated segment length support an RNA world at the
time duplication began. Random segmental duplication would greatly enhance the
ability of a genome to use its hard-to-acquire codes repeatedly, and a genome
that practiced it would have evolved enormously faster than those that did not.

the implications of the modified guidance law. We bring out a property of
mutual dependence in the particle coordinates that arises in product states,
and show that the quantum potential has scalar and vector components which
implies the particle is subject to a Lorentz-like force. The conditions for the

sufficiency of the model is demonstrated. We then present a series of

challenged in the context of two-particle interference, both from a theoretical
and an experimental point of view. We analyze different setups proposed and
derive corresponding exact forms for Bohmian equations of motion. The equations
are then solved numerically, and shown to reproduce standard quantum-mechanical
results.

entanglement in an infinitely short time, but only a finite amount in longer
times. The interaction arises from a standard Kerr nonlinearity and a 50/50
beamsplitter, and the initial state is a coherent state. For certain finite
interaction times multi-dimensional generalizations of entangled coherent
states are generated, for which we construct a teleportation protocol.
Similarities between probabilistic teleportation and unambiguous state
discrimination are pointed out.

mechanics were laid over 50 years ago, it has only been within the past few
years that viable computational implementations have been developed. One
approach to solving the hydrodynamic equations uses quantum trajectories as the
computational tool. The trajectory equations of motion are described and
methods for implementation are discussed, including fitting of the fields to
gaussian clusters.

variability, all six lens systems show evidence that suggests the presence of
extrinsic variability. In particular, the cusp images of B2045+265 -- regarded
as the strongest case of the violation of the cusp relation (i.e. the sum of
the magnifications of the three cusp images add to zero) -- show extrinsic
variations in their flux-ratios up to ~40 percent peak-to-peak on time scales
of several months. Its low Galactic latitude of b=-10 degree and a
line-of-sight toward the Cygnus superbubble region suggest that Galactic
scintillation is the most likely cause. The cusp images of B1422+231 at b=+69
degree do not show strong extrinsic variability. Galactic scintillation can
therefore cause significant scatter in the cusp and fold relations of some
radio lens systems (up to 10 percent rms), even though these relations remain
violated when averaged over a <~1 year time baseline.

significant synchrotron index steepening out of the plane suggests a diffusion
process in which the halo electrons are trapped in the Galactic potential long
enough to suffer synchrotron and inverse Compton energy losses and hence a
spectral steepening. The synchrotron index is steeper in the WMAP bands than in

Lyman alpha forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other
astronomical measurements. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of

full width at half maximum is a function of frequency and ranges from 0.82
degrees at 23 GHz to 0.21 degrees at 94 GHz; however, the beams are not
Gaussian. We present: (a) the beam patterns for all ten differential
radiometers and show that the patterns are substantially independent of
polarization in all but the 23 GHz channel; (b) the effective symmetrized beam
patterns that result from WMAP's compound spin observing pattern; (c) the
effective window functions for all radiometers and the formalism for
propagating the window function uncertainty; and (d) the conversion factor from
point source flux to antenna temperature. A summary of the systematic
uncertainties, which currently dominate our knowledge of the beams, is also
presented. The constancy of Jupiter's temperature within a frequency band is an
essential check of the optical system. The tests enable us to report a
calibration of Jupiter to 1-3% accuracy relative to the CMB dipole.

results are robust. The data are modestly contaminated by diffuse Galactic
foreground emission, but we show that a simple Galactic template model is
sufficient to remove the signal. Point sources produce a modest contamination
in the low frequency data. After masking ~700 known bright sources from the
maps, we estimate residual sources contribute ~3500 uK^2 at 41 GHz, and ~130
uK^2 at 94 GHz, to the power spectrum l*(l+1)*C_l/(2*pi) at l=1000. Systematic
errors are negligible compared to the (modest) level of foreground emission.
Our best estimate of the power spectrum is derived from 28 cross-power spectra
of statistically independent channels. The final spectrum is essentially
independent of the noise properties of an individual radiometer. The resulting
spectrum provides a definitive measurement of the CMB power spectrum, with
uncertainties limited by cosmic variance, up to l~350. The spectrum clearly
exhibits a first acoustic peak at l=220 and a second acoustic peak at l~540 and
it provides strong support for adiabatic initial conditions. Kogut et al.
(2003) analyze the C_l^TE power spectrum, and present evidence for a relatively
high optical depth, and an early period of cosmic reionization. Among other

data supplemented, where necessary, with results from ground tests. The data
are calibrated in flight using the dipole modulation of the CMB due to the
observatory's motion around the Sun. This constitutes a full-beam calibration
source. An iterative algorithm simultaneously fits the time-ordered data to
obtain calibration parameters and pixelized sky map temperatures. The noise
properties are determined by analyzing the time-ordered data with this sky
signal estimate subtracted. Based on this, we apply a pre-whitening filter to
the time-ordered data to remove a low level of 1/f noise. We infer and correct
for a small ~1% transmission imbalance between the two sky inputs to each
differential radiometer, and we subtract a small sidelobe correction from the
23 GHz (K band) map prior to further analysis. No other systematic error
corrections are applied to the data. Calibration and baseline artifacts,
including the response to environmental perturbations, are negligible.
Systematic uncertainties are comparable to statistical uncertainties in the
characterization of the beam response. Both are accounted for in the covariance
matrix of the window function and are propagated to uncertainties in the final

observation throughout all of the electromagnetic and other spectra and that,
on this basis, the next decade should be even more exciting. However, it is
imperative to observe cosmic sources throughout these spectra in order to

to learn the universal laws that govern the macroscopic and the microscopic
behavior of cosmic plasma over a great range of physical conditions by
combining observations of different classes of source. These two injunctions
are illustrated by discussions of cosmology, hot gas, supernova remnants and
explosions, neutron stars, black holes and ultrarelativistic outflows. New

protostars to cosmology. They have also drawn attention to important and
general physical processes that currently limit our understanding of thermal

(wavelengths, oscillator strengths etc.), basic hydromagnetic processes (e.g.
shock structure, reconnection), plasma processes (such as electron-ion
equipartition and heat conduction) and radiative transfer (in disks and
accretion columns). Progress on these problems will probably come from
integrative studies that draw upon observations, throughout the electromagnetic
spectrum, of different classes of source. X-ray observations are also giving a
new perspective on astronomical subjects, like the nature of galactic nuclei
and the evolution of stellar populations. They are contributing to answering
central cosmological questions including the measurement of the matter content
of the universe, understanding its overall luminosity density, describing its
chemical evolution and locating the first luminous objects. X-ray astronomy has
a healthy future with several international space missions under construction

  Depend on Chain Length up to the Melt",,,"10.1002/polb.20041",,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  Theoretical considerations based on chain connectivity and conformational
variability of polymers have lead to an uncomplicated relation for the
dependence of the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, chi, on the volume
fraction of the polymer, phi, and on its number of segments, N. The validity of
this expression is being tested extensively by means of vapor pressure
measurements and inverse gas chromatography (complemented by osmotic and light
scattering data from literature) for solutions of poly(dimethylsiloxane) in the
thermodynamically vastly different solvents n-octane (n-C8), toluene (TL), and
methylethylketone (MEK) over the entire range of composition for at least six
different molecular masses of the polymer. The new approach is capable to model
the measured chi (phi, N) very well, irrespective of the thermodynamic quality
of the solvent, in contrast to traditional expressions, which are often
restricted to good solvents but fail for bad ones and vice versa. At constant
polymer concentration the chi values result lowest for n-C8 (best solvent) and
highest for MEK (theta solvent); the data for TL fall between. The influences
of N depend strongly on the thermodynamic quality of the solvent and are not
restricted to dilute solutions. For good solvents chi increases with rising N.
The effect is most pronounced for n-C8, where the different curves for chi
(phi) fan out considerably. The influences of N become less distinct for TL,
and for MEK they vanish at the (endothermal) theta temperature. For worse than
theta conditions, the chi values of the long chains become less than that of
short ones. This change in the sign of N-influences is in agreement with the
present concept of conformational relaxation.

rendering the traditional dynamical equations obsolete. Quantization of the

to the well known problems of time evolution. These problems of time are of
both an interpretational and technical nature. In contrast, the geometrodynamic
quantization procedure on the superspace of the true dynamical variables
separates the issues of quantization from the enforcement of the constraints.
The resulting theory takes into account states that are off-shell with respect

show that it retains all essential features previously illustrated in the

out. As a step towards resolving these inconsistencies, a General Laboratory
Frame fixed on the worldline of an observer is constructed. In this frame, the
dynamics of nonrelativistic test particles in the linearized gravity limit is
studied, and their Hamiltonian dynamics is derived. It is shown that for
stationary metrics this Hamiltonian reduces to the usual Hamiltonian for
nonrelativistic particles undergoing geodesic motion. For nonstationary metrics
with long-wavelength gravitational waves (GWs) present, it reduces to the
Hamiltonian for a nonrelativistic particle undergoing geodesic
\textit{deviation} motion. Arbitrary-wavelength GWs couple to the test particle
through a vector-potential-like field $N_a$, the net result of the tidal forces
that the GW induces in the system, namely, a local velocity field on the system
induced by tidal effects as seen by an observer in the general laboratory

the dark matter particle mass is forced to change with time as to ensure that
the ratio between the energy densities of dark matter and dark energy become a
constant at late times and one readily realizes that the present-day dark

decouple from the thermal bath. We show that the dependence of the present

subtraction terms we establish a massive theory with MS-bar subtraction which
approaches the massless theory very fast with increasing transverse momentum.
With these results and including the equivalent results for the direct cross
section obtained previously as well as double-resolved contributions, we
calculate the inclusive D*+- cross section in gamma-gamma collisions using
realistic evolved non-perturbative fragmentation functions and compare with
recent data from the LEP collaborations ALEPH, L3 and OPAL. We find good
agreement.

spin-flavor oscillations at a significant rate even if this mechanism is not
the leading solution to the SNP. KamLAND is sensitive to antineutrinos
originated from solar ${}^8$B neutrinos. From KamLAND negative results after
145 days of data taking, we obtain model independent limits on the total flux
of solar electron antineutrinos $\Phi({}^8 B)< 1.1-3.5\times 10^4 cm^{-2}\
s^{-1}$, more than one order of magnitude smaller than existing limits, and on
their appearance probability $P<0.15%$ (95% CL). Assuming a concrete model for
antineutrino production by spin-flavor precession, this upper bound implies an
upper limit on the product of the intrinsic neutrino magnetic moment and the
value of the solar magnetic field $\mu B< 2.3\times 10^{-21}$ MeV 95% CL (for
LMA $(\Delta m^2, \tan^2\theta)$ values). Limits on neutrino transition moments
are also obtained. For realistic values of other astrophysical solar parameters
these upper limits would imply that the neutrino magnetic moment is constrained
to be, in the most conservative case, $\mu\lsim 3.9\times 10^{-12} \mu_B$ (95%

dimensions. The analysis is carried out in the context of a higher-dimensional
extension of QED, with the extra dimensions compactified on a torus. It is
shown that a naive $\beta$ function, which simply counts the number of modes,
depends crucially on the way the thresholds of the Kaluza-Klein modes are
crossed. To solve these ambiguities we turn to the vacuum polarization, which,
due to its special unitarity properties, guarantees the physical decoupling of
the heavy modes. This latter quantity, calculated in the context of dimensional
regularization, is used for connecting the low energy gauge coupling with the
coupling of the $D$-dimensional effective field theory. We find that the
resulting relation contains only logarithms of the relevant scales, and no
power corrections. If, instead, hard cutoffs are used to regularize the theory,
one finds power corrections, which could be interpreted as an additional
matching between the effective higher-dimensional model and some unknown, more
complete theory. The possibility of estimating this matching is examined in the
context of a toy model. The general conclusion is that, in the absence of any
additional physical principle, the power corrections depend strongly on the
details of the underlying theory. Possible consequences of this analysis for
gauge coupling unification in theories with extra dimensions are briefly
discussed.

diffraction-management concept. A straightforward discrete [$\chi ^{(2)}$]
model, with opposite signs of the diffraction at the fundamental and second
harmonics, is introduced also. Starting from the anti-continuum (AC) limit,
soliton solutions in the $\chi ^{(3)}$ model are found, both above the phonon
band and inside the gap. Solitons above the gap may be stable as long as they
exist, but in the transition to the continuum limit they inevitably disappear.
On the contrary, solitons inside the gap persist all the way up to the
continuum limit. In the zero-mismatch case, they lose their stability long
before reaching the continuum limit, but finite mismatch can have a stabilizing
effect on them. A special procedure is developed to find discrete counterparts
of the Bragg-grating gap solitons. It is concluded that they exist all the
values of the coupling constant, but are stable only in the AC and continuum
limits. Solitons are also found in the $\chi ^{(2)}$ model. They start as
stable solutions, but then lose their stability. Direct numerical simulations
in the cases of instability reveal a variety of scenarios, including
spontaneous transformation of the solitons into breather-like states,
destruction of one of the components (in favor of the other), and
symmetry-breaking effects. Quasi-periodic, as well as more complex, time
dependences of the soliton amplitudes are also observed as a result of the

that for every pure state of Schmidt rank greater than or equal to three, one
can construct n-copy undistillable NPT states, for any $n\geq1$. The abundance

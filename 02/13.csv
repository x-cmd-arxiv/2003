knowledge of the star formation history of the Universe to earlier times than

explosion are presented that encompass shock revival by neutrino heating,
neutrino-driven convection, explosive nucleosynthesis, the growth of
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, and the propagation of newly formed metal clumps
through the exploding star. In both cases we find very high Ni56 velocities of
17000 km/s shortly after shock-revival, and a complete fragmentation of the
progenitor's metal core within the first few minutes after core bounce, due to
the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the Si/O and (C+O)/He
composition interfaces. This leads to the formation of high-velocity,
metal-rich clumps which eventually decouple from the flow and move
ballistically through the ejecta. Maximum final metal velocities of 3500-5500
km/s and 1200 km/s are obtained for the Type Ib model and the Type II model,
respectively. The low maximum metal velocities in the Type II model, which are
significantly smaller than those observed in SN 1987A, are due to the massive
hydrogen envelope of the progenitor. The envelope forces the supernova shock to
decelerate strongly, leaving behind a reverse shock below the He/H interface,
which interacts with the clumps and slows them down significantly. This reverse
shock is absent in the Type Ib-like model. The latter is in fairly good
agreement with observations of Type Ib supernovae. In addition, in this case
the pattern of clump formation in the ejecta is correlated with the convective
pattern prevailing during the shock-revival phase. This might be used to deduce
observational constraints for the dynamics during this early phase of the
evolution, and the role of neutrino heating in initiating the explosion.

shown that the gap between the two classes can be filled with intermediate

of the peak frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse Compton component of the
emission. We study the consequences of this scheme using a new sample of X-ray
selected BL Lac objects comprising 104 objects with z<0.9 and a mean redshift
z=0.34. 77 BL Lacs, of which the redshift could be determined for 64 (83%)

shows negative evolution at the 2 sigma level (<V_e/V_a> = 0.42 +- 0.04). We
conclude that the observed properties of the HRX BL Lac sample show typical
behaviour for X-ray selected BL Lacs. They support an evolutionary model, in
which flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) with high energetic jets evolve
towards low frequency peaked (mostly radio-selected) BL Lac objects and later
on to high frequency peaked (mostly X-ray selected) BL Lacs.

regular pulsations, one O-rich star and four C-rich stars show large amplitude,
dK> 0.6 mag, secular or very long period variations which may be associated
with changes in their mass-loss rates. We discuss and compare various methods
of determining the bolometric magnitudes and show, perhaps surprisingly, that
most of the very long period stars seem to follow an extrapolation of the
period-luminosity relation determined for stars with shorter periods - although
the details do depend on how the bolometric magnitudes are calculated. Three
stars with thin shells, which are clearly more luminous than the obscured AGB
stars, are undergoing hot bottom burning, while other stars with similar
luminosities have yet to be investigated in sufficient detail to determine
their status in this regard. We suggest that an apparent change in slope of the

luminosities brighter than the predictions of the core-mass luminosity
relation, due to excess flux from hot bottom burning.

past this radius, with the radius of grand-design spiral structure being a

these galaxies, 4 have nearby neighbours and central bars and a further 7 have

distinct cosmological set, selected differently than other cosmological probes
such as quasars and galaxies. Since the progenitors are now believed to be
connected with active star-formation and since burst emission penetrates dust,
one hope is that with a uniformly-selected sample, the large-scale redshift
distribution of GRBs can help constrain the star-formation history of the
Universe. However, we show that strong observational biases in ground-based
redshift discovery hamper a clean determination of the large-scale GRB rate and
hence the connection of GRBs to the star formation history. We then focus on
the properties of the small-scale (clustering) distribution of GRB redshifts.
When corrected for heliocentric motion relative to the local Hubble flow, the
observed redshifts appear to show a propensity for clustering: 8 of 26 GRBs
occurred within a recession velocity difference of 1000 km/s of another GRB.
That is, 4 pairs of GRBs occurred within 30 h_65^-1 Myr in cosmic time, despite
being causally separated on the sky. We investigate the significance of this
clustering. Comparison of the numbers of close redshift pairs expected from the
simulation with that observed shows no significant small-scale clustering
excess in the present sample; however, the four close pairs occur only in about
twenty percent of the simulated datasets (the precise significance of the
clustering is dependent upon the modeled biases). We conclude with some

passing companion, play an important role in global gas dynamics in galaxies.
In particular, they are able to trigger gas inflow, which in turn feeds nuclear
activity. In the inner kiloparsec, the inflowing gas becomes subject to various
resonances induced by asymmetry in the potential. This produces complicated gas
morphology and dynamics seen in the nuclear rings and spirals. Formation of
nuclear rings is related to barred galaxies, and explained by the orbital
structure in bars. One can get basic understanding of weak nuclear spirals from
the linear wave theory, but stronger spirals are likely to be out of the linear
regime, and they appear as spiral shocks in hydrodynamical models. In addition,
nuclear stellar bars are observed in a considerable fraction of disc galaxies,
often nested inside the large bar; their orbital structure further modifies the
nuclear gas dynamics. If a massive black hole (MBH) is present in the galactic
centre, it governs the resonances even beyond its classically defined sphere of
influence. Since resonances shape gas dynamics in the nuclear region, the
central black hole should be able to regulate gas flow around itself.

non-magnetized Keplerian disks. We wish to draw attention to a route to
hydrodynamic turbulence which seems to be little known by the astrophysical
community, but which has been intensively discussed among fluid dynamicists
during the past decade. In this so-called `bypass' concept for the onset of
turbulence, perturbations undergo a transient growth, and they may reach an
amplitude that is sufficiently large to allow positive feedback through
nonlinear interactions. This transient growth is linear in nature, and thus it
differs in principle from the well-known nonlinear instability. We describe the
type of perturbations that according to this process are the most likely to
lead to turbulence, namely non-axisymmetric vortex mode perturbations in the
two dimensional limit. We show that the apparently inhibiting action of the
Coriolis force on the dynamics of such vortical perturbations is substantially
diminished due to the pressure perturbations, contrary to current opinion. We
stress the similarity of the turbulent processes in Keplerian disks and in
Cartesian flows and conclude that the prevalent skepticism of the astrophysical
community on the occurrence of hydrodynamic shear turbulence in such disks is
not founded.

core-dominated and 5 lobe-dominated) in the redshift range z=0.30--1.96, and
one low-power radio-galaxy at z=0.064. No diffuse X-ray emission is present
around the cores of the quasars, except for the nearby low-power galaxy that
has diffuse emission on a scale and with a luminosity consistent with other
FRIs. No high-amplitude, short-term variability is detected within the
relatively short Chandra exposures. However, 1510-089 shows low-amplitude flux
changes with a timescale of $\sim$25 minutes. The X-ray spectra of the quasar
cores are generally well described by a single power law model with Galactic
absorption. However, in six quasars we find soft X-ray excess emission below
1.6 keV. Interestingly, we detect an Fe K-shell emission line, consistent with
fluorescent Kalpha emission from cold Iron, in one lobe- and two core-dominated
sources. The average X-ray photon index for the quasars in the sample is
Gamma=1.66 and dispersion, sigma=0.23. The average spectral slope for our
sample is flatter than the slope found for radio-quiet quasars and for
radio-loud AGNs with larger jet orientations; this indicates that beaming
affects the X-ray emission from the cores in our sample of quasars.

$T$ is reduced, as predicted by the theory of electron-electron interactions in
diffusive wires. In contrast, samples made of a silver source material of
lesser purity or of copper exhibit an apparent saturation of $\tau_{\phi}$

implanting manganese impurities in silver wires, we show that even a minute
concentration of magnetic impurities having a small Kondo temperature can lead
to a quasi saturation of $\tau_{\phi}$ over a broad temperature range, while
the resistance increase expected from the Kondo effect remains hidden by a
large background. We also measured the conductance of Aharonov-Bohm rings
fabricated using a very pure copper source and found that the amplitude of the
$h/e$ conductance oscillations increases strongly with magnetic field. This set
of experiments suggests that the frequently observed ``saturation'' of

the kinetics of pattern formation in unstable mixtures under anisotropic
conditions. We here develop a simple theoretical description of kinetics in
Monte Carlo simulations of the DLG. A Langevin continuum analog is also studied
which is shown to exhibit the same behavior. We demonstrate that pattern growth
is mainly a consequence of single-particle processes and that, after a short
transient time, in which a surface evaporation/condensation mechanism is
important, hole diffusion in the bulk becomes dominant. Consequently, there is
a unique relevant length that behaves $l(t) \sim t^{1/3}$ for macroscopic
systems except at some very early (perhaps unobservable) time. This implies
sort of self-similarity, namely, the spatial pattern looks alike, but for a
(non-trivial) change of scale at different times. We also characterize the
structure factor, in which we identify Guinier and Porod regions, and its
scaling form with both time and size. The underlying anisotropy turns out to be
essential in determining the macroscopically-emergent peculiar behavior.

that the classical XY model and its quantum generalizations can be exploited as
effective phase-only models. In the quantum regime, however, this assumption
leads to spurious results, such as the violation of the Galilean invariance in
the continuum model. Starting from a general microscopic model, in this paper
we explicitly derive the effective low-energy theory for the phase, up to
fourth-order terms. This expansion allows us to properly take into account
dynamic effects beyond the Gaussian level, both in the continuum and in the
lattice model. After evaluating the one-loop correction to the superfluid
density we critically discuss the qualitative and quantitative differences
between the results obtained within the quantum XY model and within the correct
low-energy theory, both in the case of s-wave and d-wave symmetry of the
superconducting order parameter. Specifically, we find dynamic anharmonic
vertices, which are absent in the quantum XY model, and are crucial to restore
Galilean invariance in the continuum model. As far as the more realistic
lattice model is concerned, in the weak-to-intermediate-coupling regime we find
that the phase-fluctuation effects are quantitatively reduced with respect to
the XY model. On the other hand, in the strong-coupling regime we show that the
correspondence between the microscopically derived action and the quantum XY
model is recovered, except for the low-density regime.

of mixing on ion-beam mixing. However, the calculated mixing profile is not
sensitive to the heat of mixing. Therefore the thermal spike model of mixing is
not fully supported under these irradiation conditions. Instead we found that
the majority of mixing occurs after the thermal spike during the relaxation
process. These conclusions are supported by liquid, vacancy as well as adatom

matching of an interior solution to the unique exterior vacuum solution is done
using directly the Einstein equations. The structure as well as several

the process of matching. For instance, one finds that for asymptotically flat

thin-shell, at the boundary of the interior and exterior solutions, is always
strictly positive, whereas for de Sitter spacetime it can take either sign as
one could expect, being negative (tension) for relatively high cosmological
constant and high wormhole radius, positive for relatively high mass and small
wormhole radius, and zero in-between. Finally, some specific solutions with

braneworld inflation driven by a bulk scalar field without introducing an

minimally coupled massive scalar field in the 5-dimensional spacetime, and look
for a perturbative solution of the field equation in the anti-de Sitter

completely the color octet model is in agreement with the single data point
above 2 GeV transverse momentum. A measurement of J/\psi production at RHIC in
the next run with better statistics will allow us to determine the validity of
the color octet model of J/\psi production at RHIC energies. This is very
important because it is necessary to know the exact mechanism for J/\psi
production in pp collisions at RHIC if one is to make predictions of J/\psi
suppression as a signature of quark-gluon plasma. These mechanisms also play an
important role in determining the polarized spin structure function of the

  We calculate the temperature independent part and dependent part of the
sunset diagram separately. For the former, we obtain the discontinuous part
first and the finite continuous part next using a twice-subtracted dispersion
relation. For the latter, we express it as a one-dimensional integral in terms
of the bubble diagram.
  We also study the structure of the discontinuous part of the sunset diagram.
Physical processes, which are responsible for it, are identified. Processes due
to the scattering with particles in the heat bath exist only at finite
temperature and generate discontinuity for arbitrary momentum, which is a
remarkable feature of the two-loop diagrams at finite temperature.
  As an application of our result, we study the effect of the diagram on the
spectral function of the sigma meson at finite temperature in the linear sigma
model, which was obtained at one-loop order previously. At high temperature
where the decay $\sigma\to\pi\pi$ is forbidden, sigma acquires a finite width
of the order of $10 {\rm MeV}$ while within the one-loop calculation its width
vanishes. At low temperature, the spectrum does not deviate much from that at
one-loop order. Possible consequences with including other two-loop diagrams

restoration takes place in the underlying QCD, the HLS model uniquely leads to
the Vector Manifestation (VM) as a new pattern of Wigner realization of chiral
symmetry, with the rho becoming degenerate with the massless pi as the chiral
partner. The VM is in fact realized in the large Nf QCD when Nf to Nf^{crit}-0,

as a function of energy in the low and intermediate energy range, where many of

  The most significant effect in this energy range is by the modification of
the trajectory due to the Coulomb field. The modification in the trajectory due
to nuclear field is also taken into account in a self consistent way.
  The energy ranges in which particular corrections are effective, are
quantified and it is found that when the center of mass energy of the system
becomes 30 times the Coulomb barrier, none of the trajectory modification to
the Glauber model is really required.
  The reaction cross sections for light and heavy systems, right from near
coulomb barrier to intermediate energies have been calculated. The exact
nuclear densities and free nucleon-nucleon (NN) cross sections have been used
in the calculations. The center of mass correction which is important for light
systems, has also been taken into account.
  There is an excellent agreement between the calculations with the modified
Glauber model and the experimental data. This suggests that the heavy ion
reactions in this energy range can be explained by the Glauber model in terms
of free NN cross sections without incorporating any medium modification.

phenomenon, which specify the conditions for an epidemic to grow or die out. In
standard (mean-field-like) compartmental models the concept of the basic
reproductive number, R0, has been systematically employed as a predictor for
epidemic spread and as an analytical tool to study the threshold conditions.
Despite the importance of this quantity, there are no general formulation of R0
when one considers the spread of a disease in a generic finite population,
involving, for instance, arbitrary topology of inter-individual interactions
and heterogeneous mixing of susceptible and immune individuals. The goal of
this work is to study this concept in a generalized stochastic system described
in terms of global and local variables. In particular, the dependence of R0 on
the space of parameters that define the model is investigated; it is found that
near of the ``classical'' epidemic threshold transition the uncertainty about
the strength of the epidemic process still is significantly large. The
forecasting attributes of R0 for a discrete finite system is discussed and
generalized; in particular, it is shown that, for a discrete finite system, the
pretentious predictive power of R0 is significantly reduced.

30 - 100. RMBPT including the Breit interaction is used to evaluate retarded E1
matrix elements in length and velocity forms. First-order RMBPT is used to
obtain intermediate coupling coefficients and second-order RMBPT is used to
calculate transition matrix elements. A detailed discussion of the various
contributions to the dipole matrix elements and energy levels is given for
copperlike tungsten (Z = 74). The transition energies used in the calculation

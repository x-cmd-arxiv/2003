consistent with previous results but are considerably more precise. Both of

rises with radius. NGC4325, one of the most luminous groups at the same average

the absolute values of the entropy as a function of virial radius also differ,

include the effects of heating and/or the cooling of the gas. The total entropy
in these systems provides a strong constraint on all models of galaxy and group

cross-power spectrum does not show any significant deviation from 0. We explore
different explanations for this lack of correlation. A universe with a low
value of Sigma_8 could naturally explain the lack of correlation. We also
discuss the systematic effects which can affect this result, in particular the
subtraction of some cluster signal from the ROSAT diffuse maps which could
significantly suppress the correlation signal. These systematic effects reduce
considerably the significance of our constraints on the cosmological model.
When we include the systematic effects we find a weaker constrain on Sigma_8
allowing models with values as large as Sigma_8=1 (for Omega_m = 0.3) to be
consistent with the lack of correlation. To illustrate the capabilities of the
method with future high-quality data, we show how from the correlation signal
it should be possible to predict the level of contamination of the SZ effect on
the power spectrum of the CMB. Within the systematic errors we find evidence
that this contribution is negligible for WMAP and is expected to be small in

relativistic beaming, light bending and time delays near a non-rotating black
hole. The temporal power spectrum of the predicted emission from individual
annuli in the disc is described by a broken power law, with indices of -3.5 at
high frequency and 0 to -1 at low frequency. Integrated over the disc, the

high-amplitude variability in the iron line profile. We show that this

estimate that the resulting total production of heavy elements by slow neutron
capture s-process is too low to account for most observations. This due to the
fact that rotationally induced mixing during the interpulse phase causes a
pollution of the C13 pocket layer with the neutron poison N14. As a result we
find a maximum neutron exposure of tau_max=0.04mbarn^{-1} in the s-process
layer of our solar metallicity model with rotation. This is about a factor of 5
to 10 less than required to reproduce the observed stellar s-process abundance

overshooting mixing, and with simple parametric models including the combined
effects of overshooting and mixing in the interpulse. Within the parametric

  Fuller historical context established in introduction. Submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The basic cosmological predictions of a `polarizable-vacuum' theory of
gravity due to Dicke, predating the scalar-tensor theory, are investigated and
tested for their compliance with current observations. A Friedmann-like
equation is derived for the theory that differs in a significant way from that
of GR, for which it is demonstrated that a big bang is not a solution: the
initial scale factor may be small but not zero, and must have zero first
derivative. Detailed graphs of the predictions of the theory for combinations
of the density parameters are given. It is shown that these predictions are
compatible with current estimates for the age and deceleration parameter, and
the maximum observable redshift, provided the matter density $\Omega_m$ is
close to the luminous matter density, i.e. provided there is not a significant
amount of missing mass. For these best fit parameters, the theory predicts a
maximum initial temperature that is too small for BBN and probably too small to
support an era of radiation domination. The theory predicts a radiation power
from a binary system that is 2/3 that predicted by GR, and so incompatible with
observed orbital decay rate of PSR 1913 + 16. There is some discussion of
possible developments, including reconciliation through accommodation of vacuum
anisotropy, and of the relation between PV and the Yilmaz theory and the

catalogue containing 22652 QSOs. Utilising the huge volume probed by the QSOs,
we can accurately measure power out to scales of ~500Mpc and derive new
constraints, at z~1.4, on the matter and baryonic contents of the Universe.
Importantly, these new cosmological constraints are derived at an intermediate
epoch between the CMB observations at z~1000, and local (z~0) studies of
large-scale structure; the average QSO redshift corresponds to a look-back time
of approximately two-thirds of the age of the Universe. We find that the
amplitude of clustering of the QSOs at z~1.4 is similar to that of present day
galaxies. The power spectra of the QSOs at high and low redshift are compared
and we find little evidence for any evolution in the amplitude. Assuming a
lambda cosmology to derive the comoving distances, r(z), to the QSOs, the power
spectrum derived can be well described by a model with shape parameter
Gamma=0.13+-0.02. If an Einstein-de Sitter model r(z) is instead assumed, a
slightly higher value of Gamma=0.16+-0.03 is obtained. A comparison with the
Hubble Volume LCDM simulation shows very good agreement over the whole range of
scales considered. A standard (Omega_m=1) CDM model, however, predicts a much
higher value of Gamma than is observed, and it is difficult to reconcile such a
model with these data. We fit CDM model power spectra (assuming scale-invariant
initial fluctuations), convolved with the survey window function, and corrected
for redshift space distortions, and find that models with baryon oscillations
are slightly preferred, with the baryon fraction Omega_b/Omega_m=0.18+-0.10.
The overall shape of the power spectrum provides a strong constraint on
Omega_m*h (where h is the Hubble parameter), with Omega_m*h=0.19+-0.05.

(GRBs) that occur inside pulsar wind bubbles (PWBs). This is the most natural
outcome of the supranova model, where initially a supernova (SN) explosion
takes place, leaving behind a supra-massive neutron star, which loses its
rotational energy over a time t_sd and collapses to a black hole, triggering a
GRB. We find that the time delay, t_sd, between the SN and GRB events is the
most important parameter that determines the behavior of the system. We
consider the afterglow, prompt GRB and PWB emission. Constraints on the model
are derived for a spherical PWB, from current afterglow observations and the
lack of direct detection of the PWB emission. We find that a simple spherical
model cannot account for the X-ray features detected in some afterglows,
together with the typical afterglow emission that was observed for the same
GRBs. The discrepancies with observations may be reconciled by resorting to a
non-spherical geometry, where the PWB is elongated along the polar axis.
Finally, we predict that the inverse Compton upscattering of PWB photons by the
relativistic electrons of the afterglow (external Compton) should lead to high
energy emission during the early afterglow that may explain the GeV photons
detected by EGRET for a few GRBs, and should be detectable by future missions
such as GLAST.

of optical polarization. First source is due to correlations between electron
and heavy hole (HH) phases of $\psi $-functions arising due to electron Zeeman
spin splitting and joint manifestation of low-symmetry and Zeeman interactions
of HH in an in-plane magnetic field. In this case, four possible
phase-controlled electron-HH transitions constitute the polarization effect,
which can reach its maximal amount ($\pm $1) at low temperatures when only one
transition survives. Other polarization source stems from the admixture of
excited light-holes (LH) states to HH by low-symmetry interactions. The
contribution of this mechanism to total polarization is relatively small but it
can be independent of temperature and magnetic field. Analysis of different
mechanisms of HH splitting exhibits their strong polarization anisotropy. Joint
action of these mechanisms can result in new peculiarities, which should be
taken into account for explanation of different experimental situations.

correlators, and have made a comparison to the lattice results for the

coupling parameters that we have used in previous studies of the mesonic
confinement-deconfinement transition. We also see that the spectral functions
obtained when using the maximum-entropy-method (MEM) and the lattice data
differ from the spectral functions that we calculate in our chiral model.
However, our results for the Euclidean-time correlators are in general
agreement with the lattice results, with better agreement when our
temperature-dependent coupling parameters are used than when
temperature-independent parameters are used for the NJL model. We also discuss
some additional evidence for the utility of temperature-dependent coupling
parameters for the NJL model. For example, if the constituent quark mass at T=0
is $352 {MeV}$ in the chiral limit, the transition temperature is $T_c=208
{MeV}$ for the NJL model with a standard momentum cutoff parameter. (If a
Gaussian momentum cutoff is used, we find $T_c=225 {MeV}$ in the chiral limit,
with $m=368 {MeV}$ at T=0.) The introduction of a weak temperature dependence
for the coupling constant will move the value of $T_c$ into the range 150-170
MeV, which is more in accord with what is found in lattice simulations of QCD
with dynamical quarks.

forth a new Cosmological Model in which the expanding
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe emerges from the Big Bang with a
shock wave at the leading edge of the expansion, analogous to a classical shock
wave explosion. This explosion is large enough to account for the enormous
scale on which the galaxies and the background radiation appear uniform. In
these models, the shock wave must lie beyond one Hubble length from the FRW
center, this threshhold being the boundary across which the bounded mass lies
inside its own Schwarzshild radius, $2M/r>1,$ and thus the shock wave solution
evolves inside a Black Hole. The entropy condition, which breaks the time
symmetry, implies that the shock wave must weaken until it eventually settles
down to a zero pressure OS interface, bounding a {\em finite} total mass, that
emerges from the White Hole event horizon of an ambient Schwarzschild
spacetime. However, unlike shock matching outside a Black Hole, the equation of
state $p=\frac{c^2}{3}\rho,$ the equation of state at the earliest stage of Big
Bang physics, is {\em distinguished} at the instant of the Big Bang--for this
equation of state alone, the shock wave emerges from the Big Bang at a finite
nonzero speed, the speed of light, decelerating to a subluminous wave from that
time onward. These shock wave solutions indicate a new cosmological model in
which the Big Bang arises from a localized explosion occurring inside the Black
Hole of an asymptotically flat Schwarzschild spacetime.

certain zero-weight representations of a (generalised) Weyl group of SU(2n). A

other and develop non trivial geometries, which effectively reflect the
structure of the turbulence. We investigate here the geometry, in a statistical
sense, of three Lagrangian particles advected, in 2-dimensions, by Kinematic
Simulation (KS). KS is a Lagrangian model of turbulent diffusion that makes no
use of any delta correlation in time at any level. With this approach,
situations with a very large range of inertial scales and varying persistence
of spatial flow structure can be studied.
  We first show numerically that the model flow reproduces recent experimental
results at low Reynolds numbers. The statistical properties of the shape
distribution at much higher Reynolds number is then considered. Even at the
highest available inertial range, of scale, corresponding to a ratio between
large and small scales of $L/\eta \approx 17,000$, we find that the radius of
gyration of the three points does not precisely follow Richardson's prediction.
The shapes of the triangles have a high probability to be elongated. The
corresponding shape distribution is not found to be perfectly self similar,
even for our highest ratio of inertial scales. We also discuss how the
parameters of the synthetic flow, such as the exponent of the spectrum and the
effect of the sweeping affect our results. Our results suggest that a non
trivial distribution of shapes will be observed at high Reynolds numbers,
although it may not be exactly self similar. Special attention is given to the
effects of persistence of spatial flow structure.

E, Feb. 2003 2 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.67.067201",,"nlin.CD",,"  Within random matrix theory, the statistics of the eigensolutions depend
fundamentally on the presence (or absence) of time reversal symmetry. Accepting
the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture, this statement extends to quantum
systems with chaotic classical analogs. For practical reasons, much of the
supporting numerical studies of symmetry breaking have been done with billiards
or maps, and little with simple, smooth systems. There are two main
difficulties in attempting to break time reversal invariance in a continuous
time system with a smooth potential. The first is avoiding false symmetry
breaking. The second is locating a parameter regime in which the symmetry
breaking is strong enough to transition the fluctuation properties fully toward
the broken symmetry case, and yet remain weak enough so as not to regularize
the dynamics sufficiently that the system is no longer chaotic. We give an
example of a system of two-coupled quartic oscillators whose energy level
statistics closely match those of the Gaussian unitary ensemble, and which
possesses only a minor proportion of regular motion in its phase space.

that gains in fitness during competition were prevalent for organisms that were
taken from the base of a fitness peak, but absent or rare for organisms that
were taken from the top of a peak or from a considerable distance away from the
nearest peak. In the latter two cases, either neutral drift and loss of the
fittest mutants or the waiting time to the first beneficial mutation were more
important factors. Moreover, I found that the Red-Queen dynamic in general led
to faster exclusion than the other two mechanisms.

phenomenological representation of Lindblad decoherence mechanisms. We use this
formalism to describe the interaction of a single stationary multilevel atom
with one or more propagating classical or quantum laser fields, and we describe
in detail several manifestations and applications of electromagnetically
induced transparency. In addition to providing a clear description of the
nonlinear optical characteristics of electromagnetically transparent systems
that lead to ``ultraslow light,'' we verify that -- in principle -- a
multi-particle atomic or molecular system could be used as either a low power

  relationship between this work & popular views",,,,"quant-ph",,"  As part of a challenge to critics of Bell's analysis of the EPR argument,
framed in the form of a bet, R. D. Gill formulated criteria to assure that all
non-locality is precluded from simulation-algorithms used to test Bell's
theorem. This is achieved in part by parceling out the subroutines for the
source and both detectors to three separate computers. He argues that, in light
of Bell's theorem, following these criteria absolutely precludes mimicking
EPR-B correlations as computed with Quantum Mechanics and observed in
experiments. Herein, nevertheless, we describe just such an local algorithm,
fully faithful to his criteria, that yields results mimicking exactly quantum
correlations. We observe that our simulation-algorithm succeeds by altering an
implicit assumption made by Bell to the equivalent effect that the source of
EPR pairs is a single Poisson process followed by deterministic detection.
Instead we assume the converse, namely that the source is deterministic but
detection involves multiple, independent Poisson processes, one at each
detector with an intensity given by Malus' Law. Finally, we speculate on some
consequences this might have for quantum computing algorithms.

to date have essentially used two or three-passband aperture photometry,
combined with theoretical stellar population synthesis models, to obtain age,
mass and extinction estimates, and sometimes also metallicities. The accuracy
to which this can be done depends on the choice of passband combination and,
crucially, also on the wavelength range covered. Understanding the systematic
uncertainties is of the utmost importance for a well-balanced interpretation of
the properties of extragalactic star cluster systems. We simultaneously obtain
ages, metallicities and extinction values for ~300 clusters in the nearby
starburst galaxy NGC 3310, based on archival Hubble Space Telescope
observations from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near-infrared (NIR). We show
that, for ages 6 <= log(age/yr) <= 9, and if one can only obtain partial
coverage of the spectral energy distribution (SED), an optical passband
combination of at least four filters including BOTH blue AND red passbands
results in the most representative age distribution. We find that while
blue-selected passband combinations lead to age distributions that are slightly
biased towards younger ages due to the age-metallicity degeneracy,
red-dominated passband combinations should be avoided. NGC 3310 underwent a
global burst of cluster formation ~3x10^7 yr ago. This coincides closely with
the last tidal interaction or merger with a low-metallicity galaxy that likely
induced the formation of the large fraction of clusters with (significantly)
subsolar metallicities. The observed cluster system has a median mass of
<log(m/Msun)> = 5.25 +- 0.1, obtained from scaling the appropriate model SEDs
for known masses to the observed cluster SEDs.

Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to explore the width of Draco's blue horizontal
branch over a range of areas covering 0.06 square degrees to 6.25 square
degrees centered on Draco. The SDSS database is the only currently existing
database with sufficient depth and area coverage to permit a stringent test of
the tidal models. We show that blue horizontal branch stars extend beyond the
previously inferred limiting radii of Draco, consistent with the observed
absence of a truncated stellar surface density profile of this dSph. We
calculate new models for a galaxy without dark matter, using Draco's
morphological properties as constraints. The resulting models are unable to
reproduce the narrow observed horizontal branch width of Draco, which stays
roughly constant regardless of the field of view. We conclude that Draco cannot
be the remnant of a tidally disrupted satellite, but is probably strongly
dark-matter dominated. (ABSTRACT ABBREVIATED)

unusual Fe K variability observed in MCG--6-30-15. In this paper, we test this
model using a 325 ks observation of MCG--6-30-15 by XMM-Newton and BeppoSAX.
The data are fit between 2.5 and 80 keV with the constant density models of
Ross & Fabian. The best fit ionized reflection model requires the Fe K line to
be split into two reprocessing events: one from the inner disc to build up the
red wing, and the other from the outer accretion disc to fit the blue horn. The
implied geometry is a disc which becomes strongly warped or flared at large
radii. A good fit was obtained with a solar abundance of iron and a reflection
fraction (R) of unity for the inner reflector. The combination of the two
reflection spectra can appear to have R>2 as required by the BeppoSAX data. The
inner reflector has an ionization parameter \log \xi =3.8, but the outer one is
neutral with an inner radius ~70 gravitational radii (r_g), corresponding to a
light crossing time of about an hour for a 10^7 Msun black hole. Applying this
model to time-resolved spectra shows that the inner reflector becomes more
ionized as the source brightens. This reduces the strength of the red wing at
high flux states. The X-ray source is constrained to arise from a narrow
annulus at ~5 r_g, with only 6 per cent of the 2-10 keV flux due to the outer
reprocessor. This amount of localized energy generation is extremely difficult
to produce without resorting to other energy sources such as the black hole
spin. In fact, all the Fe K models fit to XMM-Newton spectra of MCG--6-30-15
require a large increase in energy production at the inner edge of the
accretion disc.

MgII absorber (W(2796)>0.3A) with only weak CIV absorption (it is
``CIV-deficient''). To study this system, we used high-resolution spectra from
both HST/STIS (R=30,000) and Keck/HIRES (R=45,000). These spectra cover key
transitions, such as MgI, MgII, FeII, SiII, CII, SiIII, CIII, SiIV, and CIV.
Assuming a Haardt and Madau extragalactic background spectrum, we modeled the
system with a combination of photoionization and collisional ionization. Based
on a comparison of synthetic spectra to the data profiles, we infer the
existence of the following four phases of gas: i) Seven MgII clouds have sizes
of 1-1000pc and densities of 0.002-0.1/cm^3, with a gradual decrease in density
from blue to red. The MgII phase gives rise to most of the CIV absorption and
resembles the warm, ionized inter-cloud medium of the Milky Way; ii) Instead of
arising in the same phase as MgII, MgI is produced in separate, narrow
components with b~0.75km/s. These small MgI pockets (~100AU) could represent a
denser phase (~200/cm^3) of the interstellar medium (ISM), analogous to the
small-scale structure observed in the Milky Way ISM; iii) A ``broad phase''
with a Doppler parameter, b~60km/s, is required to consistently fit Ly-alpha,
Ly-beta, and the higher-order Lyman-series lines. A low metallicity (log Z <=
-2) for this phase could explain why the system is ``CIV-deficient'', and also
why NV and OVI are not detected. This phase may be a galactic halo or it could
represent a diffuse medium in an early-type galaxy; iv) The strong absorption
in SiIV relative to CIV could be produced in an extra, collisionally ionized
phase with a temperature of T~60,000K. The collisional phase could exist in
cooling layers that are shock-heated by supernovae-related processes.

absorption in S0-2 with equivalent widths (2.8+-0.3 Ang & 1.7+-0.4 Ang) and an
inferred stellar rotational velocity (220+-40 km/s) that are consistent with
that of an O8-B0 dwarf, which suggests that it is a massive (~15 Msun), young
(<10 Myr) main sequence star. This presents a major challenge to star formation
theories, given the strong tidal forces that prevail over all distances reached
by S0-2 in its current orbit (130 - 1900 AU) and the difficulty in migrating
this star inward during its lifetime from further out where tidal forces should
no longer preclude star formation. The radial velocity measurements (-510+-40
km/s) and our reported proper motions for S0-2 strongly constrain its orbit,
providing a direct measure of the black hole mass of 4.1(+-0.6)x10^6(Ro/8kpc)^3
Msun. The Keplerian orbit parameters have uncertainities that are reduced by a
factor of 2-3 compared to previously reported values and include, for the first
time, an independent solution for the dynamical center; this location, while
consistent with the nominal infrared position of Sgr A*, is localized to a
factor of 5 more precisely (+-2 milli-arcsec). Furthermore, the ambiguity in
the inclination of the orbit is resolved with the addition of the radial
velocity measurement, indicating that the star is behind the black hole at the
time of closest approach and counter-revolving against the Galaxy. With further
radial velocity measurements in the next few years, the orbit of S0-2 will
provide the most robust estimate of the distance to the Galactic Center.

investigated in the context of an inhomogeneous chemical evolution model in
which supernovae induce star formation. The proposed model explains recent
observations for Omega Cen stars, and divides star formation into three epochs.
At the end of the first epoch, ~ 70% of the gas was expelled by supernovae. AGB
stars then supplied s-process elements to the remaining gas during the first
interval of ~300 Myr. This explains the observed sudden increase in Ba/Fe
ratios in Omega Cen stars at [Fe/H] ~ -1.6. Supernovae at the end of the second
epoch were unable to expel the gas. Eventually, Type Ia supernovae initiated
supernova-induced star formation, and remaining gas was stripped when the
cluster passed through the newly formed disk of the Milky Way. The formation of
Omega Cen is also discussed in the framework of globular cluster formation
triggered by cloud-cloud collisions. In this scenario, the relative velocity of
clouds in the collision determines the later chemical evolution in the
clusters. A head-on collision of proto-cluster clouds with a low relative
velocity would have converted less than 1% of gas into stars and promoted the
subsequent chemical evolution by supernova-driven star formation. This is
consistent with present observed form of Omega Cen. In contrast, the other
Galactic globular clusters are expected to have formed from more intense
head-on collisions, and the resultant clouds would have been too thin for
supernovae to accumulate enough gas to form the next generation of stars. This
explains the absence of chemical evolution in these other globular clusters.

in copious amounts. In this paper we present the neutrino emission results
obtained via Newtonian, high-resolution simulations of the coalescence event.
These simulations use three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics
together with a nuclear, temperature dependent equation of state and a
multi-flavour neutrino leakage scheme. We present the details of our scheme,
discuss the neutrino emission results from a neutron star coalescence and
compare them to the core-collapse supernova case where neutrino emission has
been studied for several decades. The average neutrino energies are similar to
those in the supernova case, but contrary to the latter, the luminosities are
dominated by electron-type antineutrinos which are produced in the hot,
neutron-rich, thick disk of the merger remnant. The cooler parts of this disk
contain substantial fractions of heavy nuclei, which, however, do not influence
the overall neutrino emission results significantly. Our total neutrino
luminosities from the merger event are considerably lower than those found in
previous investigations. This has serious consequences for the ability to
produce a gamma-ray burst via neutrino annihilation. The neutrinos are emitted
preferentially along the initial binary rotation axis, an event seen
``pole-on'' would appear much brighter in neutrinos than a similar event seen
``edge-on''.

associated with `dark energy' may decay slowly with time. Decaying dark energy
is modeled by a homogeneous scalar field which couples minimally to gravity and
whose potential has {\em at least one} local quadratic maximum. Dark energy
decays as the scalar field rolls down its potential, consequently the current
acceleration epoch is a transient. We examine two models of decaying dark
energy. In the first, the dark energy potential is modeled by an analytical
form which is generic close to the potential maximum. The second potential is
the cosine, which can become negative as the field evolves, ensuring that a
spatially flat universe collapses in the future. We examine the feasibility of
both models using observations of high redshift type Ia supernovae. A maximum
likelihood analysis is used to find allowed regions in the $\lbrace m,
\phi_0\rbrace$ plane ($m$ is the tachyon mass modulus and $\phi_0$ the initial
scalar field value; $m\sim H_0$ and $\phi_0\sim M_P$ by order of magnitude).
For the first model, the time for the potential to drop to half its maximum
value is larger than $\sim 8$ Gyrs. In the case of the cosine potential, the
time left until the universe collapses is always greater than $\sim 18$ Gyrs
(both estimates are presented for $\om = 0.3$, $m/H_0 \sim 1$, $H_0 \simeq 70$

phenomenon is hereby recognized as a nontrivial heteropolymer property capable
of providing fundamental insight into protein energetics. Many current protein
chain models, including common lattice and continuum G\=o models with explicit
native biases, fail to reproduce this generic protein property. Here we show
that simple two-state kinetics is obtainable from models with a cooperative
interplay between core burial and local conformational propensities or an extra
strongly favorable energy for the native structure. These predictions suggest
that intramolecular recognition in real two-state proteins is more specific
than that envisioned by common G\=o-like constructs with pairwise additive
energies. The many-body interactions in the present kinetically two-state
models lead to high thermodynamic cooperativity as measured by their van't Hoff
to calorimetric enthalpy ratios, implying that the native and denatured
conformational populations are well separated in enthalpy by a high free energy
barrier. Consistent with experiments, comparison among the present models with
extra native favorabilities indicate that their folding rate at a given
interaction strength decreases with increasing native contact order, although
the dependence is weaker than the corresponding trend in real proteins. It has
been observed experimentally that deviations from Arrhenius behavior are often
more severe for folding than for unfolding. This asymmetry may be rationalized
by one ...

decays via quark loops as well as Zweig rule violating instanton--induced
decays generated by the six--quark vertex of 't Hooft's interaction; the latter

indicate that physiological variability should be severely restricted in order

is investigated by computing classical normal modes as well as by evaluating
the transient growth of optimal disturbances. The flows examined are the
rotating Blasius (RB) and the rotating asymptotic suction layers (RAS), with
the rotation axis normal to the basic flow plane. In agreement with an inviscid
criterion, streamwise unstable modes are found in both flow cases for
anti-cyclonic rotation: at high Reynolds numbers, one obtains the Rossby number
unstable range 0<1/Ro<0.57 for RB, or 0<1/Ro<1 for RAS. Critical Reynolds and
Rossby numbers are also determined in both instances. Moreover the dependence
of transient growth with respect to wavenumbers, Rossby and Reynolds numbers is
presented for both cyclonic and anti-cyclonic r\'egimes. In particular, the
{\it peak} transient growth is computed for a wide range of parameter values
within the cyclonic regime and is shown to be reduced by rotation. A scaling
analysis with respect to the Reynolds number is performed showing that the
standard Re^2 scaling is recovered only at very weak rotation. Optimal
disturbances resemble oblique vortices. At weak rotation, they are almost
streamwise vortices though their structure departs from the classical
non-rotating case. Strong rotation imposes two-dimensionality and the optimal
disturbances vary weakly in the spanwise direction and exhibit growth by the
Orr mechanism.

Various previously isolated observations about the structure of the regularized

stemming from the fact that certain (presumably physically meaningful) terms in
the renormalized vacuum energy density in the interior of a cavity become
singular at the boundary and correlate to certain divergent terms in the

formation, Orion BN/KL, performed at both low resolution mode (grating mode)
and high resolution mode (Fabry-Perot) with the Long Wavelength Spectrometer on
board the Infrared Space Observatory. We detected the CO rotational lines from
Jup = 15 to Jup = 45. While the lines with Jup<= 32 are spectrally unresolved,
the higher lying lines show a broadened profile. Finally, we detected two 13CO
lines, namely at Jup = 18 and 24, from which we could derive the opacities of
the relative 12CO lines. The LVG analysis of the observed line spectrum allows
to distinguish three main physical components with different temperatures,
densities and column densities: 1) lines with Jup< 20 originate mainly in the
diffuse photodissociation region surrounding the source; 2) lines with Jup
between 20 and 30 originate in the high velocity outflow (plateau) emanating
from IrC2; 3) lines with Jup > 32 originate in the hot and dense gas of the
shocked component of the outflow. We discuss how future observations with HIFI,
onboard the Far Infrared Space Telescope (FIRST) will allow to spectrally and
spatially disentangle the three components, and, consequently, characterise
more precisely the Orion BN/KL star forming region.

During the first embedded phase (the so called class 0/1), the protostar is
surrounded by a collapsing envelope, whose physical and chemical structure
would set up the initial conditions of the proto-stellar disk which may
eventually form planets. In this contribution, we show how spectroscopic far
infrared to millimeter observations can be a powerful diagnostic to derive the
chemical and physical structure of the innermost regions of envelopes
collapsing around solar type protostars, where disk are believe to form. Our
claim is based on the simultaneous modeling of the dynamics, chemistry and
radiative transfer in a protostellar envelope. Here we present a study of a
class 0 protostar NGC1333-IRAS4, obtained using ISO-LWS observations of water
far-infrared lines. We show the derived physical and chemical structure of the
protostar, namely the density and temperature profiles, as well as the water
abundance across the envelope. Besides, the mass of the central protostar and
its accretion rate can be constrained by these observations and modeling,
yielding an alternative method to measure these two poorly know parameters.

power law above few GeV with spectral index ($\gamma_{-} = 3.41 \pm 0.02$),
consistent with the spectral index of the positron spectrum ($\gamma_{+} = 3.40

supernova explosion among those that formed the local bubble. In addition, at
low energy, the electron spectrum measured during the last $A+$ solar phase is
damped, whereas the positron spectrum is well represented by a single power law
down to the lowest inferred local interstellar energy (0.8 GeV). We suggest
that this difference arises from a time- and charge-dependent effect of the

two nodes depends only on the distance between them in the metric space. We
study the performance of a peer-to-peer system where nodes are embedded at grid
points in a simple metric space: a one-dimensional real line. We prove upper
and lower bounds on the message complexity of locating particular resources in
such a system, under a variety of assumptions about failures of either nodes or
the connections between them. Our lower bounds in particular show that the use
of inverse power-law distributions in routing, as suggested by Kleinberg
(1999), is close to optimal. We also give efficient heuristics to dynamically
maintain such a system as new nodes arrive and old nodes depart. Finally, we
give experimental results that suggest promising directions for future work.

time (the time usually used in classical cosmology). We show that in spite of
the constraint, under the specific circumstances, the averaging of some of the

time dependence of the expectation values of certain dynamical variables in
quantum cosmology. This idea is realized explicitly in a higher dimensional
model with a negative cosmological constant and dust as the sources of gravity.
When there is an anisotropy in the evolution of the universe, the above
phenomenon (i.e. explicit cosmic time dependence of certain expectation values)
appears and we find the new quantum effect which consists in ""quantum

  and 5, 2003",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  We consider two situations that can be modeled by oscillators. First we show
that the universe itself is a normal mode of Planck scale oscillators. Next we
show that a background Zero Point Field or dark energy can be modeled by
electromagnetic oscillators. This in turn leads to an observable
""fluctuational"" current in a solenoid.

studied with a physical pendulum. The polaroid samples were placed under the
knife-edges of the pendulum, which was operated in free-decay at a period in
the vicinity of 10 s. With the edges oriented parallel to the direction of the
long molecular chains in the polaroid, it was found that the damping was more
than 10% smaller than when oriented perpendicular to the chains.

considered. The finiteness of the conductivity of the metals is taken into
account perturbatively up to the fourth order of the relative penetration
depths of electromagnetic zero-point oscillations into the metals. The
influence of nonzero temperature is computed explicitly for separate orders of
perturbation and found to be important in the zeroth and first orders only. The
configurations of two parallel plates and a sphere (spherical lens) above a
plate are considered made of $Au$ and $Cr$. The obtained results can be used to
take into account also the surface roughness. Thus, the total amount of the
Casimir force between different metals with all correction factors is
determined. This may be useful in various applications.

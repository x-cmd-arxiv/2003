redshift errors and systematics in cluster identification. Our tests show that
the redshift-space clustering pattern of galaxy systems is highly influenced by
effects associated with the identification procedure from two dimensional

that is present and even stronger in a subsample whose angular positions
coincide with 3-dimensional identified clusters. The use of a small number of
redshift measurements in the determination of the cluster distance has a
smaller impact on the measured correlation function. We show that an angular
incompleteness in redshift surveys, such as that present in the 2dFGRS 100k

emission (~20kpc) consistent with the asymmetric halo of diffuse emission
observed in optical and infra-red images. In the nucleus we observe complex
emission line profiles requiring 3 Gaussian components (narrow, intermediate
and broad). The broadest component (FWHM ~2000 km/s) is blue shifted by ~2000
km/s with respect to the galaxy halo and HI absorption. We interpret this as
material in outflow. We find evidence for high reddening and measure
E(B-V)>0.92 for the broadest component. From [S II]6716,6731 we estimate
electron densities of n_e<150cm^{-3}, n_{e}>5300 cm^{-3} and n_{e}>4200 cm^{-3}

respectively. We calculate a total mass of line emitting gas of M_{gas}<10^6

PKS 1345+12 is a young radio source whose nuclear regions are enshrouded in a

out of the nuclear regions. Emission originates from three kinematically

to exhibit the most extreme NV/CIV emission resonance line ratio observed among

prototype of polars, AM Her, with the absence of a detectable narrow component.
The OVI broad line is detected with an equivalent width of the same order as in
AM Her, the blueward doublet component is clearly present but the redward
component is strongly affected by H2 absorption. The presence of a strong NIII
line and weak CIII lines also confirms the peculiar CNO line flux. We compare
the resonance CNO line intensities with the predictions of the CLOUDY plasma
code coupled to a geometrical model of the accretion column. Varying the
temperature and/or intensity of the ionising spectrum is unable to reproduce
the observed broad line ratios. A solution is obtained by significantly
altering the element abundances with a strong depletion of C, overabundance of
N and a weak underabundance of O. This confirms previous suggestions of
non-solar abundances which may result from redistribution in the accreted
material following nova outbursts and/or the secondary nuclear evolution. A
very significant H2 absorption is observed in front of the source, a possible
indication for either the existence of a dense interstellar cloud or of

stars with the core filled with neutron and proton superfluids, taking account
of entrainment effects between the superfluids. In this paper, the entrainment
effects are modeled by introducing a parameter $\eta$ so that no entrainment
state is realized at $\eta=0$. We find that inertial modes of rotating neutron
stars with the superfluid core are split into two families, which we call
ordinary fluid inertial modes ($i^o$-mode) and superfluid inertial modes
($i^s$-mode). The two superfluids in the core counter-move for the $i^s$-modes.
For the $i^o$-modes, $\kappa_0=\lim_{\Omega\to 0}\omega/\Omega$ is only weakly
dependent on the entrainment parameter $\eta$, where $\Omega$ and $\omega$ are
the angular frequency of rotation and the oscillation frequency observed in the
corotating frame of the star, respectively. For the $i^s$-modes, on the other
hand, $|\kappa_0|$ almost linearly increases as $\eta$ increases. Avoided
crossings as functions of $\eta$ are therefore quite common between $i^o$- and
$i^s$-modes. We find that some of the $i^s$-modes that are unstable against the
gravitational radiation reaction at $\eta=0$ become stable when $\eta$ is
larger than $\eta_{crit}$, the value of which depends on the mode. Since the
radiation driven instability associated with the current multipole radiation is
quite weak for the inertial modes and the mutual friction damping in the
superfluid core is strong, the instability caused by the inertial modes will be
easily suppressed unless the entrainment parameter $\eta$ is extremely small
and the mutual friction damping is sufficiently weak.

distribution with respect to the surface metallicity. We have derived the
actual form of this distribution function. This metallicity distribution
function strongly suggests that the recently discovered most metal-deficient
star HE0107-5240 with [Fe/H]=-5.3 was born as a metal-free star and accreted
gas polluted with heavy elements. Thus the heavy elements such as Fe in
HE0107-5240 must have been supplied from supernovae of later generations
exploding inside the cloud in which the star had been formed. The elemental
abundance pattern on the surface of stars suffering from such an external
pollution should not be diverse but exhibit the average pattern of numerous
supernovae. Future observations for a number of metal-deficient stars with

km/s and a spatial positional accuracy of ~2.5 arcmin. Thus far about 1115 sq
deg have been surveyed. We describe the methods of detecting galaxies within
the HIJASS data and of measuring their HI parameters. The properties of the
resulting HI-selected sample of galaxies are described. Of the 222 sources so
far confirmed, 170 (77 per cent) are clearly associated with a previously
catalogued galaxy. A further 23 sources (10 percent) lie close (within 6
arcmin) to a previously catalogued galaxy for which no previous redshift
exists. A further 29 sources (13 per cent) do not appear to be associated with
any previously catalogued galaxy. The distributions of peak flux, integrated
flux, HI mass and cz are discussed. We show, using the HIJASS data, that HI
self-absorption is a significant, but often overlooked, effect in galaxies with
large inclination angles to the line of sight. Properly accounting for it could
increase the derived HI mass density of the local Universe by at least 25 per
cent. The effect this will have on the shape of the HI Mass Function will
depend on how self-absorption affects galaxies of different morphological types
and HI masses. We also show that galaxies with small inclinations to the line
of sight may also be excluded from HI-selected samples, since many such
galaxies will have observed linewidths which are too narrow for them to be
distinguished from narrow-band radio frequency interference.

the visible baryonic mass. Dark matter density profiles with an inner cusp as
steep as R^{-1}, are compatible with M33 data. The dark matter concentrations
required for fitting the M33 rotation curve are very low but marginally
consistent with halos forming in a standard Cold Dark Matter cosmology. The M33
virialized dark halo is at least 50 times more massive than the visible baryons
and its size is comparable with the M33-M31 separation. Inner cusps as steep as
R^{-1.5} are ruled out, while halo models with a large size core of constant
density are consistent with the M33 data. A central spheroid of stars is needed
and we evaluate its dynamical mass range. Using accurate rotational velocity
gradients and the azimuthally averaged baryonic surface densities, we show that
a disk instability can regulate the star formation activity in M33. Considering
the gaseous surface density alone, the predicted outer star formation threshold
radius is consistent with the observed drop of the H-alpha surface brightness
if a shear rate criterion is used. The classical Toomre criterion predicts
correctly the size of the unstable region only when the stellar or dark halo
gravity, derived in this paper, is added to that of the gaseous disk.

variations in both physical quantities (e.g. gas mass) and directly observable
quantities (e.g. X-ray luminosities). The luminosity of the galaxy's X-ray halo
is found to compare favourably with the observationally determined correlation
with optical blue band luminosity (L_X:L_B) relation. Factors affecting the
X-ray luminosity are explored and it is found that the gas injection rate is a
dominant factor in determining the integrated luminosity. Observational
properties of the material stripped from the galaxy, which forms an X-ray wake,
are investigated and it is found that wakes are most visible around galaxies

that the gauge transformations generated by the translational group is only a

like the case of topologically massive gauge theories, translational groups act
as generators of gauge transformations in gauge theories obtained by extending
massive gauge noninvariant theories by a Stuckelberg mechanism. The
representations of the translational groups that generate gauge transformations
in such Stuckelberg extended theories can be obtained by the method of
dimensional descent. We illustrate these with the examples of Stuckelberg
extended first class versions of Proca, Einstein-Pauli-Fierz and massive
Kalb-Ramond theories in 3+1 dimensions. A detailed analysis of the partial
gauge generation in massive and massless 2nd rank symmetric gauge theories is

creation by spontaneous emission in a system of two non-overlapping two-level
atoms. We calculate and illustrate graphically populations of the collective
atomic states and the Wootters entanglement measure (concurrence) for two sets
of initial atomic conditions. Our calculations include the dipole-dipole
interaction and a spatial separation between the atoms that the antisymmetric
state of the system is included throughout even for small interatomic
separations. It is shown that spontaneous emission can lead to a transient
entanglement between the atoms even if the atoms were prepared initially in an
unentangled state. We find that the ability of spontaneous emission to create
the transient entanglement relies on the absence of population in the
collective symmetric state of the system. For the initial state of only one
atom excited, the entanglement builds up rapidly in time and reaches a maximum
for the parameter values corresponding roughly to zero population in the
symmetric state. On the other hand, for the initial condition of both atoms
excited, the atoms remain unentangled until the symmetric state is depopulated.
A simple physical interpretation of these results is given in terms of the
diagonal states of the density matrix of the system. We also study entanglement
creation in a system of two non-identical atoms of different transition
frequencies. It is found that the entanglement between the atoms can be
enhanced compared to that for identical atoms, and can decay with two different
time scales resulting from the coherent transfer of the population from the
symmetric to the antisymmetric state. In addition, we find that a decaying
initial entanglement between the atoms can display a revival behaviour.

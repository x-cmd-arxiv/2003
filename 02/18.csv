cosmic microwave background data, including the new results from the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and large scale structure data from the two
degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS). We tested four parameterizations
taking into account the uncertainties in four cosmological parameters. First we
parameterize the initial spectrum by a tilt and a running spectral index,
finding marginal evidence for a running spectral index only if the first three
WMAP multipoles (ell=2,3,4) are included in the analysis. Secondly, to
investigate further the low CMB large scale power, we modify the conventional
power-law spectrum by introducing a scale above which there is no power. We
find a preferred position of the cut at k_c ~ 3e-4 /Mpc although k_c=0 (no cut)
is not ruled out. Thirdly we use a model independent parameterization, with 16
bands in wavenumber, and find no obvious sign of deviation from a power law
spectrum on the scales investigated. Furthermore the values of the other
cosmological parameters defining the model remain relatively well constrained
despite the freedom in the shape of the initial power spectrum. Finally we
investigate a model motivated by double inflation, in which the power spectrum
has a break between two characteristic wavenumbers. We find that if a break is
required to be in the range 0.01 < k Mpc <0.1 then the ratio of amplitudes
across the break is constrained to be 1.23 +/- 0.14. Our results are consistent
with a power law spectrum that is featureless and close to scale invariant over
the wavenumber range 0.005 ~< k Mpc ~< 0.15, with a hint of a decrease in power
on the largest scales.

  Implications for Dark Matter","15 pages, including 4 figures. To appear in the Proceedings of the
  STScI Symposium on ""Dark Universe: Matter, Energy, and Gravity""",,,,"astro-ph",,"  (Abridged) A close scrutiny of the microlensing results towards the
Magellanic clouds reveals that the stars within the Magellanic clouds are major
contributors as lenses, and the contribution of MACHOs to dark matter is 0 to
5%. The principal results which lead to this conclusion are the following.
  (i) Out of the ~17 events detected so far towards the Magellanic Clouds, the
lens locations have been determined for four events where the lenses are most
likely within the Magellanic clouds.
  (ii) If caused by MACHOs, the event timescales would imply that the MACHOs in
the direction of the LMC and the SMC have masses of the order of 0.5 and 2
solar masses, respectively. This is inconsistent with even the most flattened
model of the Galaxy. If caused by stars within the Magellanic Clouds, the
masses of the lenses are of the order of 0.2 solar mass for both the LMC as
well as the SMC.
  (iii) The fact that the two observed binary events are caused by lenses
within the Magellanic Clouds would suggest that there should be a total of ~20
events caused by lenses within the Magellanic Clouds. This implies that most of
the microlensing events observed so far are probably caused by stars within the
Magellanic Clouds.
  (iv) If the microlensing events are caused by MACHOs of 0.5 solar mass, ~15
events should have been detected by now towards the SMC, with timescales of ~40
days. The fact that both the events detected towards the SMC have been shown to
be due to self-lensing places severe constraints on the MACHO contribution and
suggests that the contribution of MACHOs to dark matter is consistent with
zero, with an upper limit of 5%.

those at very early times. There is also a second adiabatic mode, for which
${\cal R}$ vanishes for large wavelength, and in general there may be
non-adiabatic modes as well. These conclusions apply in all eras and whatever
the constituents of the universe, under only a mild technical assumption about
the wavelength dependence of the field equations for large wave length. In the
absence of anisotropic inertia, the perturbations in the adiabatic modes are
given for large wavelength by universal formulas in terms of the
Robertson--Walker scale factor. We discuss an apparent discrepancy between
these results and what appears to be a conservation law in all modes found for
large wavelength in synchronous gauge: it turns out that, although equivalent,
synchronous and Newtonian gauges suggest inequivalent assumptions about the
behavior of the perturbations for large wavelength.

Optical and X-ray data for these regions are retrieved both from archival

stars (M < 1M_sun) we observe an increase in L_X/L_bol in the first 3-4 Myr and
a subsequent leveling off at the saturation level (L_X/L_bol ~ -3). Slowly
evolving very low mass stars then retain saturated levels down to the oldest
ages here considered, while for higher mass stars activity begins to decline at
some age after ~10^7 years. We find our data consistent with the following
tentative picture: low mass PMS stars with no circumstellar accretion disk have
saturated activity, consistently with the activity-Rossby number relation
derived for MS stars. Accretion and/or the presence of disks somehow lowers the
observed activity levels; disk dissipation and/or the decrease of mass
accretion rate in the first few Myrs of PMS evolution is therefore responsible

scales of the 2dFGRS, APMBGC, APM-Stromlo Redshift Survey, Durham-UKST (DUKST)
survey, Millenium Galaxy Catalogue (MGC) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
We find evidence for scale and zero-point errors in the 2dFGRS northern field,
DUKST and APM data of 0.10, 0.24 and 0.31 mag. respectively; we find excellent
agreement with the MGC and SDSS photometry. We find conclusive evidence that
the S counts with B<17 mag are down by ~30% relative to both the N counts and
to the models of Metcalfe et al. We further compare the n(z) distributions from
the B<17 mag. DUKST and B<19.5 2dFGRS redshift surveys using the corrected
photometry. While the N n(z) from 2dFGRS appears relatively homogeneous over
its whole range, the S n(z) shows a 30% deficiency out to z=0.1; at higher
redshifts it agrees much better with the N n(z) and the homogeneous model n(z).
The DUKST n(z) shows that the S `hole' extends over a 20 by 75 degree squared
area. The troughs with z<0.1 in the DUKST n(z) appear deeper than for the
fainter 2dFGRS data. This may be evidence that the local galaxy distribution is
biased on >50 h-1 Mpc scales which is unexpected in a Lambda-CDM cosmology.
Finally, since the Southern local void persists over the full area of the APM
and APMBGC with a ~25% deficiency in the counts below B~17, this means that its
extent is ~300 h-1 Mpc by 300 h-1 Mpc on the sky as well as ~300 h-1 Mpc in the
redshift direction. Such a 25% deficiency extending over ~10^7 h-3 Mpc^3 may
imply that the galaxy correlation function's power-law behaviour extends to

second incremental release, two techniques for probing large-scale structure at
distances of ~150 h-1 Mpc are investigated. First, we study the counts from two
sets of six 5 degree by ~80 degree strips in the two galactic caps. In the six
southern strips a deficit of ~30% was found relative to a predicted homogeneous
distribution at K~11. These strips were also in good agreement with a model
incorporating the radial density function of the southern 2dF Galaxy Redshift
Survey (2dFGRS), which shows a deep underdensity between ~90 and 180 h-1 mpc.
These results indicate a very large `local hole' in the Southern Galactic Cap
(SGC) to >150 h-1 Mpc with a linear size across the sky of ~200 h-1 Mpc, but
with a significantly lower mean underdensity of ~30% than that suggested by the
bright APM SGC counts. The counts in the northern set of strips are low overall
but indicate a more varied pattern. When all the available 2MASS data with
|b|>30 were aggregated, they indicated underdensities of ~18% and ~30% at K~11
for the northern and southern areas respectively. Our second method uses the
ratio of the counts with 11.38<K<12.38 to 12.88<K<13.38 binned in 25 degree
squared areas; the counts from these areas provide a smoothed map over the sky
of the slope in the counts between K=11.38 and 13.38. The resulting map picks
out known rich clusters, demonstrating usefulness as a probe of LSS at
distances of <150 h-1 Mpc. Interestingly, the map also shows large regions,
\~100 degrees across, of steep counts in both hemispheres. Thus, the present
2MASS data suggest the presence of a potentially huge contiguous void
stretching from south to north, indicating the possible presence of significant
power on scales of >300 h-1 Mpc in the galaxy power spectrum.

are required to explain the geodesic precession in double neutron star binaries
such as B1913+16. On the contrary, spin-kick alignment has been claimed for the
Vela and Crab pulsars whose kicks are relatively small. We propose that the
larger kick component, when present in a pulsar, results from the disruption of
an evanescent proto-neutron star binary and is spin perpendicular; the smaller
kick component is associated to some other mechanism that leads to less
vigorous kicks, predominantly parallel to the spin, because of phase averaging.
This gives rise to a ""bimodal distribution"" in the peculiar velocities of
neutron stars, as observed in the pulsar sample. The kick velocity is found to
scale with the mass of the star that remains as M^(-2/3). This scenario can
explain the run-away black hole GRO J1655-40, the first to show evidence for a

equilibrium model, the density profile is well-fit by either an NFW or Moore
profile over a limited range of radii and scale factors. For the radial orbit
model, we find profiles which are generally steeper than the NFW profile, with
an inner logarithmic slope approaching -2, consistent with a purely radial
collisionless system. In the fluid approximation, we find good agreement with
the NFW and Moore profiles for radii resolved by N-body simulations (r/r_200 >
0.01), and an evolution of concentration parameter nearly identical to that
found in N-body simulations. The evolving structure of cosmological halos is
therefore best understood as the effect of a time-varying rate of mass infall

cosmological minihalos overtaken by the ionization fronts which swept through
the IGM during reionization in a LCDM universe, including the effects of
radiative transfer. We demonstrate the phenomenon of I-front trapping inside
minihalos, in which the weak, R-type fronts which traveled supersonically
across the IGM decelerated when they encountered the dense, neutral gas inside
minihalos, becoming D-type I-fronts, preceded by shock waves. For a minihalo
with virial temperature T_vir < 10,000 K, the I-front gradually burned its way
through the minihalo which trapped it, removing all of its baryonic gas by
causing a supersonic, evaporative wind to blow backwards into the IGM, away
from the exposed layers of minihalo gas just behind the advancing I-front.
  Such hitherto neglected feedback effects were widespread during reionization.
N-body simulations and analytical estimates of halo formation suggest that
sub-kpc minihalos such as these, with T_vir < 10,000 K, were so common as to
dominate the absorption of ionizing photons. This means that previous estimates
of the number of ionizing photons per H atom required to complete reionization
which neglected this effect may be too low. Regardless of their effect on the
progress of reionization, however, the minihalos were so abundant that random
lines of sight thru the high-z universe should encounter many of them, which

distances. We report the discovery of an empirical color relation for Type Ia
light curves: During much of the first month past maximum, the magnitudes of
Type Ia supernovae defined at a given value of color index have a very small
magnitude dispersion; moreover, during this period the relation between $B$
magnitude and $B-V$ color (or $B-R$ or $B-I$ color) is strikingly linear, to
the accuracy of existing well-measured data. These linear relations can provide
robust distance estimates, in particular, by using the magnitudes when the
supernova reaches a given color. After correction for light curve strech factor
or decline rate, the dispersion of the magnitudes taken at the intercept of the
linear color-magnitude relation are found to be around 0$^m$.08 for the
sub-sample of supernovae with \BVm $\le 0^m.05$, and around 0$^m$.11 for the
sub-sample with \BVm $\le 0^m.2$. This small dispersion is consistent with
being mostly due to observational errors. The method presented here and the
conventional light curve fitting methods can be combined to further improve
statistical dispersions of distance estimates. It can be combined with the
magnitude at maximum to deduce dust extinction. The slopes of the
color-magnitude relation may also be used to identify intrinsically different
SN Ia systems. The method provides a tool that is fundamental to using SN Ia to
estimate cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and the mass and
dark energy content of the universe.

determine the upper mass limit of the first stars. Although the consensus is
that massive stars were commonly formed in the first cosmic structures, our
calculations show that their actual formation depends sensitively on the mass
accretion rate and its time variation. Even in the rather idealized case in
which star formation is mainly determined by dot{M}acc, the characteristic mass
scale of the first stars is rather uncertain. We find that there is a critical
mass accretion rate dot{M}crit = 4 10^{-3} Msun/yr that separates solutions
with dot{M}acc< dot{M}crit in which objects with mass >> 100 Msun can form,
provided there is sufficient matter in the parent clouds, from others
(dot{M}acc > dot{M}crit) where the maximum mass limit decreases as dot{M}acc
increases. In the latter case, the protostellar luminosity reaches the
Eddington limit before the onset of hydrogen burning at the center via the
CN-cycle. This phase is followed by a rapid and dramatic expansion of the
radius, possibly leading to reversal of the accretion flow when the stellar
mass is about 100Msun. (abridged)

GRB020405. Ground-based optical observations started about 1 day after the GRB
and spanned a period of ~10 days; archival HST data extended the coverage up to
70 days after the GRB. We report the first detection of the afterglow in NIR
bands. The detection of emission lines in the optical spectrum indicates that
the GRB is located at z = 0.691. Absorptions are also detected at z = 0.691 and
at z = 0.472. The latter system is likely caused by clouds in a galaxy located
2 arcsec southwest of the GRB host. Hence, for the first time, the galaxy
responsible for an intervening absorption system in the spectrum of a GRB
afterglow is identified. Optical and NIR photometry indicates that the decay in
all bands follows a single power law of index alpha = 1.54. The late-epoch VLT
and HST points lie above the extrapolation of this power law, so that a plateau
is apparent in the VRIJ light curves at 10-20 days after the GRB. The light
curves at epochs later than day ~20 after the GRB are consistent with a
power-law decay with index alphaprime = 1.85. We suggest that this deviation
can be modeled with a SN having the same temporal profile as SN2002ap, but 1.3
mag brighter at peak, and located at the GRB redshift. Alternatively, a shock
re-energization may be responsible for the rebrightening. A polarimetric R-band
measurement shows that the afterglow is polarized, with P = 1.5 % and theta =
172 degrees. Optical-NIR spectral flux distributions show a change of slope
across the J band which we interpret as due to the presence of nu_c. The
analysis of the multiwavelength spectrum within the fireball model suggests
that a population of relativistic electrons produces the optical-NIR emission
via synchrotron in an adiabatically expanding blastwave, and the X-rays via IC.

embedded in a protoplanetary disk. Results of two different numerical
approaches are presented. In the first kind of model the motion of the disk
material is followed by fully viscous hydrodynamical simulations, and the
planetary motion is determined by N-body calculations including exactly the
gravitational potential from the disk material. In the second kind we only
solve the N-body part and add additional analytically given forces which model
the effect of the torques of the disk. This type of modeling is of course
orders of magnitudes faster than the full hydro-model. Another advantage of
this two-fold approach is the possibility of adjusting the otherwise unknown
parameters of the simplified model.
  The results give very good agreement between the methods. Using two different
initial setups for the planets and disk, we obtain in the first case a resonant
trapping into the 3:1 resonance, and in the second case a trapping into the 2:1
resonance. Resonant capture leads to a rise in the eccentricity and to an
alignment of the of the spatial orientation of orbits. The characteristics of
the numerical results agree very favorably with those of 3 observed planetary
systems (GJ 876, HD 82943, and 55 Cnc) known to be in mean motion resonances.

computed for a solute moving through an isotropic array of obstacles under the
influence of a finite external field. The calculation scheme is also shown to
agree with existing zero-field results, the latter obtained elsewhere either by
first-passage time analysis or use of the Nernst-Einstein equation in the

distribution, which after a finite renomalization becomes non-analytic, thus
overcoming the predictions of the seemingly exact dimensional reduction. We
discuss, how a renormalizable field theory can be constructed, even beyond
1-loop order. We then discuss an elastic manifold imbedded in N dimensions, and
give the exact solution for N -> oo. This is compared to predictions of the
Gaussian replica variational ansatz, using replica symmetry breaking. We

Gilbert damping and the energy accumulation due to the spin torque supplied by
the spin current. The magnetic energy oscillates as a function of time even for

differential equations to diagonalize the Sutherland model and establish a
precise connection between this correlated system's wave functions, with those
of the free particles on a circle. In the process, we obtain a new expression

results are consistent with the scaling law ""Lambda inversely proportional to
the square root of V"" observed experimentally, where Lambda is the facet length

the Standard Model (SM) expression for QWP including one-loop radiative

QWP is suppressed in the SM, making it a unique place to look for physics
beyond the SM. Examples include extra neutral gauge bosons, supersymmetry, and
leptoquarks. We argue that a QWP measurement will provide an important
complement to both high energy collider experiments and other low energy

knowledge of the order alpha_s corrections to the pure electroweak box

the gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking models. The AD field is trapped far
away from the origin by the negative thermal correction for a long time until
the temperature of the universe becomes low enough. The most striking feature
is that the Hubble parameter becomes much smaller than the mass scale of the
radial component of the AD field, during the trap. Then, the amplitude of the
AD field decreases so slowly that the baryon number is not fixed even after the
onset of radial oscillation. The resultant baryon asymmetry crucially depends
on whether the Hubble parameter, $H$, is larger than the mass scale of the
phase component of the AD field, $M_\theta$, at the beginning of oscillation.
If $H < M_\theta$ holds, the formation of Q balls plays an essential role to
determine the baryon number, which is found to be washed out due to the
nonlinear dynamics of Q-ball formation. On the other hand, if $H > M_\theta$
holds, it is found that the dynamics of Q-ball formation does not affect the
baryon asymmetry, and that it is possible to generate the right amount of the
baryon asymmetry.

exists amongst Higgs scalars with m_{H_u}^2<m_{H_d}^2. Viable solutions lead to
a radiatively generated inverted scalar mass hierarchy, with third generation
and Higgs scalars being lighter than other sfermions. These models have very
heavy sfermions, so that unwanted flavor changing and CP violating SUSY
processes are suppressed, but may suffer from some fine-tuning requirements.
While the generated spectra satisfy b->s gamma and (g-2)_mu constraints, there
exists tension with the dark matter relic density unless m_{16}<3 TeV. These
models offer prospects for a SUSY discovery at the Fermilab Tevatron collider
via the search for chargino_1 neutralino_2 -> 3 leptons events, or via gluino
pair production. If mu<0, Yukawa coupling unification to less than 5% can occur
for m_{16} and m_{1/2}>1-2 TeV. Consistency of negative mu Yukawa unified
models with b->s gamma, (g-2)_mu, and relic density all imply very large values

new effects formally vanish in the limit of zero lattice spacing, but do not do
so quickly enough to reproduce the continuum physics consistently in an

make sense as an effective theory up to energies parametrically higher than the

$\Omega$ is a convex body in Euclidean space $\RR^d$ or in $\TT^d$, which is
symmetric about the origin. Over all positive definite functions supported in
$\Omega$, and with normalized value 1 at the origin, what is the largest
possible value of their integral? From this Arestov, Berdysheva and Berens
arrived to pose the analogous pointwise extremal problem for intervals in
$\RR$. That is, under the same conditions and normalizations, and for any
particular point $z\in\Omega$, the supremum of possible function values at $z$
is to be found. However, it turns out that the problem for the real line has
already been solved by Boas and Kac, who gave several proofs and also mentioned
possible extensions to $\RR^d$ and non-convex domains as well.
  We present another approach to the problem, giving the solution in $\RR^d$
and for several cases in $\TT^d$. In fact, we elaborate on the fact that the
problem is essentially one-dimensional, and investigate non-convex open domains
as well. We show that the extremal problems are equivalent to more familiar
ones over trigonometric polynomials, and thus find the extremal values for a
few cases. An analysis of the relation of the problem for the space $\RR^d$ to
that for the torus $\TT^d$ is given, showing that the former case is just the
limiting case of the latter. Thus the hiearachy of difficulty is established,
so that trigonometric polynomial extremal problems gain recognition again.

independent of the specific interaction which keeps the system bound. An
interesting example is given by relations between the size of the system and
the separation energy, or scaling laws. So far, scaling laws have been
investigated for short-range and long-range (repulsive) potentials. We report
here on scaling laws for weakly bound two-body systems valid for a larger class
of potentials, i.e. short-range potentials having a repulsive core and
long-range attractive potentials. We emphasize analogies and differences
between the short- and the long-range case. In particular, we show that the
emergence of halos is a threshold phenomenon which can arise when the system is
bound not only by short-range interactions but also by long-range ones, and
this for any value of the orbital angular momentum $\ell$. These results
enlarge the image of halo systems we are accustomed to.

collisions. The $J/\psi$ production is assumed to be a two step process, (i)
formation of $c\bar{c}$ pairs, perturbatively calculable, and (ii) formation of
$J/\psi$ from the pair, a non-perturbative process, which is conviniently
parametrized. In a nuclear medium, as the $c\bar{c}$ pair passes through the
nuclear medium, it gain relative square momentum and some of the pairs can gain
enough square momentum to cross the threshold for open charm meson, leading to
suppression in nuclear medium. Few parameters of the model were fixed from the
latest high statistics NA50 pA and NA38 SU total $J/\psi$ cross sectional data.
The model then reproduces the centrality dependence of $J/\psi$ over Drell-Yan
ration in 200 GeV/c S+U and 158 GeV/c Pb+Pb collisions. We also discuss the
centrality dependence of $J/\psi$ suppression at RHIC energy.

calculations has been addressed recently in a paper by Conrad et al. (Physical
Review D 67 (2003) 012002). In their work, systematic uncertainities in
detector efficiencies and background flux predictions were incorporated
following the hybrid frequentist-Bayesian prescription of Cousins and Highland,
but using the likelihood ratio ordering of Feldman and Cousins in order to
produce ""unified"" confidence intervals. In general, the resulting intervals
behaved as one would intuitively expect, i.e. increased with increasing
uncertainties. However, it was noted that for numbers of observed events less
than or of order of the expected background, the intervals could sometimes
behave in a completely counter-intuitive fashion -- being seen to initially
decrease in the face of increasing uncertainties, but only for the case of
increasing signal efficiency uncertainty. In this comment, we show that the
problematic behaviour is due to integration over the signal efficiency
uncertainty while maximising the best fit alternative hypothesis likelihood. If
the alternative hypothesis likelihood is determined by unconditionally
maximising with respect to both the unknown signal and signal efficiency
uncertainty, the limits display the correct intuitive behaviour.

the optical spectrum in the form of vibrational replicas of the pure electronic

extended unidentified TeV gamma-ray source lying at the outskirts of Cygnus
OB2. This is the most massive stellar association known in the Galaxy,
estimated to contain ~2600 OB type members alone. It has been previously argued
that the large scale shocks and turbulence induced by the multiple interacting
supersonic winds from the many young stars in such associations may play a role
in accelerating Galactic cosmic rays. Indeed, Cyg OB2 also coincides with the
non-variable MeV-GeV range unidentified EGRET source, 3EG 2033+4118. We report
on the near-simultaneous follow-up observations of the extended TeV source
region with the CHANDRA X-ray Observatory and the Very Large Array (VLA) radio
telescope obtained in order to explore this possibility. Analysis of the CO,
HI, and IRAS 100 micron emissions shows that the TeV source region coincides
with an outlying sub-group of powerful OB stars which have evacuated or
destroyed much of the ambient atomic, molecular and dust material, and which
may be related to the very high-energy emissions. An interesting SNR-like
structure is also revealed near the TeV source region in the CO, HI and radio
emission maps. Applying a numerical simulation which accurately tracks the
radio to gamma-ray emission from primary hadrons as well as primary and
secondary e+/-, we find that the broadband spectrum of the TeV source region
favors a predominantly nucleonic - rather than electronic - origin of the
high-energy flux, though deeper X-ray and radio observations are needed to
confirm this. A very reasonable, ~0.1%, conversion efficiency of Cyg OB2's
extreme stellar wind mechanical luminosity to nucleonic acceleration to ~PeV
(10^15 eV) energies is sufficient to explain the multifrequency emissions.

zero, as seen by absorbers and at random points in space. Assuming that about 2

pertinent as they already include a sizeable number of points in the $1<z<2$

single quasar, produced by a pair of lens galaxies. Multi-frequency VLBA maps
show that the sixth and faintest component has a different radio spectrum than
the others, confirming that it represents a second component of the background
source rather than a sixth image. The lens models predict that there should be
additional faint images of this second source component, and we find evidence
for one of the predicted images. The previously-observed large angular sizes of
two of the five bright components are not intrinsic (which would have excluded
the possibility that they are lensed images), but are instead due to scatter
broadening. Both the extended radio emission observed at low frequencies, and
the intrinsic image shapes observed at high frequencies, can be explained by
the lens models. The pair of lens galaxies is marginally detected in HST

photoelectric effect dominates the heating. Comparison of the [CII] emission
with the far-infrared (FIR) emission allows to constrain the efficiency of the
photoelectric heating, using model calculations that take into account the
strength of the radiation field. Recent [CII] observations carried out with the
ISO satellite have made this study possible. In this work we study the
correlation between FUV absorption and FIR emission using three-dimensional
models. The density distributions are obtained with numerical simulations of
compressible magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence, with rms sonic Mach numbers
0.6<M<10. The FIR intensities are solved with detailed radiative transfer
calculations. The [CII] line radiation is estimated assuming the [CII] line
cooling equals the FUV absorption multiplied by the efficiency of the
photoelectric heating, epsilon. The average ratio between the predicted [CII]
and FIR emissions is found to be remarkably constant between different models,
implying that the derived values of epsilon should not depend on the rms Mach
number. The comparison with empirical data from translucent, high latitude
clouds yields an estimate of the photoelectric heating efficiency of 2.9 10^-2.
This value confirms previous theoretical predictions. Our models show that most
of the scatter in the observed [CII] and FIR intensities can be understood as a
result of the highly fragmented density field in turbulent HI clouds. The
scatter can be reproduced with models with supersonic turbulence, while
subsonic turbulence fails to generate the observed scatter.

South of the pulsar. Indications of this object have been reported previously,
but its symmetric morphology around the pulsar and other details had not been
identified as they were hidden due to poor sensitivity to low spatial
frequencies.
  The structure is highly polarised and the polarisation vectors, once
corrected for Faraday rotation, reveal symmetry with respect to the spin axis
of the pulsar. The X-ray emission found by Chandra lies at the centre of this
structure, in a region which has no detectable excess of radio emission. We
estimate total fluxes and regional fluxes from the Northern and Southern lobes,
plus the X-ray region at four radio frequencies; 1.4, 2.4, 5 and 8.5 GHz. We
present the corresponding images in both the total and polarised intensities,
as well as those showing the derotated linear polarisation vectors.

peculiar velocity we find $\mu_* = 45 \pm 1.3$ \myr with a position angle (PA)
of $301^\circ\pm1.8$ which implies that the proper motion has a small but

The large discrepancy between the column density observed in X-rays and that

the nucleus. Then, the X-ray and the optical obscuration come from two
different regions: the X-ray close to the accretion disk while the optical at
much larger >0.25pc scales.

compact symmetric objects (CSOs) and compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources.
Observations reveal a distinctive high-frequency steepening of the radio
spectra of many of these sources. The existence of such a spectral feature is
expected or may be naturally interpreted in terms of radiative ageing of
synchrotron emitting electrons. The small angular size of CSS sources makes it
relatively easy to measure their integrated spectra over a wide frequency range
for a conspicuous number of objects. For those sources whose emission is
dominated by the mini-lobes, the integrated spectra can be used to constrain
the source age. Assuming equipartition magnetic fields, the spectral ages we
found are in the range from 10^2 to 10^5 yr. Multifrequency VLBA observations
allow us to study the spectral properties of two CSOs: B1323+321 and B1943+546.
The case of B1943+546 is particularly interesting since for this source a
kinematic age has been derived from the proper motion of the hot spots. We
found that spectral and kinematic ages agree within a factor of 2. The overall
results presented here confirm that the CSOs and CSS sources are indeed young
objects. Finally, we show some examples of compact sources characterised by an
extraordinary steep and curved spectrum. It is plausible that these are relic
sources in which the injection of fresh electrons has ceased for a significant
fraction of their lifetime. These observations may indicate either the presence
of intermittent activity or a class of short-living objects.

limit. These seven objects are among the closest LIGs and have been classified
as starburst galaxies from optical spectroscopy. Our goal consists in modelling
the continuum spectral energy distribution (SED) of each galaxy, particularly
in the infrared range. Models are further constrained by observed emission-line
ratios in the optical range. The multi-cloud models consistently account for
the coupled effect of shock, photoionization by hot stars, and diffuse
secondary radiation from the shock-heated gas. Emission from clouds in the
neighbourhood of evolved starbursts and with high shock velocities (~ 500 km/s)
explains both the bremsstrahlung and reradiation from dust in the mid-infrared.
Clouds with lower velocity (~ 100 km/s) and corresponding to younger starbursts
also contribute to both line and continuum spectra. Both low- and high-velocity
clouds are thus present in nearly all the sample galaxies. For all the
galaxies, an old stellar population is revealed by black body emission in the
optical-NIR range. Dust-to-gas ratios vary in different regions of individual

dwarf. Only if the reprocessing rate of X-rays to optical light is high a
luminosity as high as observed can be understood. But a recent detailed study
of the soft X-ray radiation reprocessing in supersoft X-ray sources has shown
that the efficiency is not high enough. We here propose a solution for this

the accretion stream at the outer disc rim produces a ``spray'', consisting of
a large number of individual gas blobs imbedded in a surrounding corona. For
the high mass flow rate this constitutes an optically thick vertically extended
screen at the rim of the accretion disc. We analyse the optical properties of
this irradiated spray and find that the multiple scattering between these gas
blobs leads to an effective reprocessing of soft X-rays to optical light as
required by the observations.

superconductors; in particular for high Tc superconductors. The conventional
view is that a Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii transition occurs as long as
finite size effects do not obscure the transition. However, there have been
recent suggestions that a different transition actually occurs which
incorporates aspects of both the dynamic scaling theory of Fisher, Fisher, and
Huse and the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii transition. Of general interest is
that this modified transition apparently has a universal dynamic critical
exponent. Some have countered that this apparent universal behavior is rooted
in a newly proposed finite-size scaling theory; one that also incorporates
scaling and conventional two-dimensional theory. To investigate these issues we
study DC voltage versus current data of a 12 angstrom thick YBCO film. We find
that the newly proposed scaling theories have intrinsic flexibility that is
relevant to the analysis of the experiments. In particular, the data scale
according to the modified transition for arbitrarily defined critical
temperatures between 0 K and 19.5 K, and the temperature range of a successful
scaling collapse is related directly to the sensitivity of the measurement.
This implies that the apparent universal exponent is due to the intrinsic
flexibility rather than some real physical property. To address this intrinsic
flexibility, we propose a criterion which would give conclusive evidence for
phase transitions in two-dimensional superconductors. We conclude by reviewing
results to see if our criterion is satisfied.

modelling complex systems. In classic Erdos networks, which exhibit a
Poissonian degree distribution, the number of appearances of a subgraph G with
n nodes and g edges scales with network size as \mean{G} ~ N^{n-g}. However,
many natural networks have a non-Poissonian degree distribution. Here we
present approximate equations for the average number of subgraphs in an
ensemble of random sparse directed networks, characterized by an arbitrary
degree sequence. We find new scaling rules for the commonly occurring case of
directed scale-free networks, in which the outgoing degree distribution scales
as P(k) ~ k^{-\gamma}. Considering the power exponent of the degree
distribution, \gamma, as a control parameter, we show that random networks
exhibit transitions between three regimes. In each regime the subgraph number
of appearances follows a different scaling law, \mean{G} ~ N^{\alpha}, where
\alpha=n-g+s-1 for \gamma<2, \alpha=n-g+s+1-\gamma for 2<\gamma<\gamma_c, and
\alpha=n-g for \gamma>\gamma_c, s is the maximal outdegree in the subgraph, and
\gamma_c=s+1. We find that certain subgraphs appear much more frequently than
in Erdos networks. These results are in very good agreement with numerical
simulations. This has implications for detecting network motifs, subgraphs that
occur in natural networks significantly more than in their randomized

time--reversal invariant diffusion processes deduced by stochastic variational
principles (Nelson processes). By general arguments, we show that the diffusion
coefficient, expressed in units of length, is given by $\lambda_c\sqrt{N}$,
where $N$ is the number of particles in the beam and $\lambda_c$ the Compton
wavelength of a single constituent. This diffusion coefficient represents an
effective unit of beam emittance. The hydrodynamic equations of the stochastic
dynamics can be easily recast in the form of a Schr\""odinger equation, with the
unit of emittance replacing the Planck action constant. This fact provides a
natural connection to the so--called ``quantum--like approaches'' to beam
dynamics. The transition probabilities associated to Nelson processes can be
exploited to model evolutions suitable to control the transverse beam dynamics.
In particular we show how to control, in the quadrupole approximation to the
beam--field interaction, both the focusing and the transverse oscillations of
the beam, either together or independently.

the framework of a stochastic-hydrodynamic model for the collective motion of

phase of the charged beam obey a set of coupled nonlinear hydrodynamic
equations with explicit time-reversal invariance. This leads to a linearized
theory that describes the collective dynamics of the beam in terms of a
classical Schr\""odinger equation. Taking into account space-charge effects, we
derive a set of coupled nonlinear hydrodynamic equations. These equations
define a collective dynamics of self-interacting systems much in the same
spirit as in the Gross-Pitaevskii and Landau-Ginzburg theories of the
collective dynamics for interacting quantum many-body systems. Self-consistent
solutions of the dynamical equations lead to quasi-stationary beam
configurations with enhanced transverse dispersion and transverse emittance
growth. In the limit of a frozen space-charge core it is then possible to
determine and study the properties of stationary, stable core-plus-halo beam
distributions. In this scheme the possible reproduction of the halo after its
elimination is a consequence of the stationarity of the transverse distribution
which plays the role of an attractor for every other distribution.

lies in the 1\sigma range 0.94<n_s<1.04 with no evidence of running. The ratio
of the amplitudes of tensor and scalar perturbations is smaller than 0.61 and
the inflationary scale is below 2.8\times 10^{16} GeV, both at the 2\sigma C.L.
No class of inflation or ekpyrotic/cyclic models is excluded. The \lambda
\phi^4 potential is excluded at 3\sigma only if the number of e-folds is
assumed to be less than 45.

outstanding scientists in the sense that the priority is given to the
realization of inefficient algorithms, based on a belief that ill-posed
problems are adequate to real phenomena. A new method of the solution of
problems, traditionally associated with Fredholm integral equations of the
first kind, is developed. Its key aspect is a constructive use of possibilities
of the functional space $l_2$ to ensure the conditions of correctness. A
well-known phenomenon of smoothing of information is taken into account by
means of a special composition that explicitly involves the sought function and
is infinitesimal in the space $L_2$. By relatively simple transformations, the
outlined class of problems is reduced to the solution of Fredholm integral
equations of the second kind with properties most favorable for the numerical
realization. We demonstrate a reduction to Fredholm integral equations of the
first kind and, correspondingly, a possibility to extend the suggested approach
to wide classes of linear and nonlinear boundary-value and
initial-boundary-value problems. We put forward arguments that the
determination of causal relationships, based on the formulation restricted to a
primitive renaming of known and unknown functions of the corresponding direct
problem, is essentially illegitimate.

long-time averaging by angle-averaging over up to 73 directions from a single

accumulates random mutations is an important variable in several evolutionary
theories. At an intuitive level, it might seem natural that random mutations
should tend to interact synergistically, such that the rate of mean fitness
decline accelerates as the number of random mutations is increased. However, in
a number of recent studies, a prevalence of antagonistic epistasis (the
tendency of multiple mutations to have a mitigating rather than reinforcing
effect) has been observed.
  Results: We studied in silico the net amount and form of epistatic
interactions in RNA secondary structure folding by measuring the fraction of
neutral mutants as a function of mutational distance d. We found a clear
prevalence of antagonistic epistasis in RNA secondary structure folding. By
relating the fraction of neutral mutants at distance d to the average
neutrality at distance d, we showed that this prevalence derives from the
existence of many compensatory mutations at larger mutational distances.
  Conclusions: Our findings imply that the average direction of epistasis in
simple fitness landscapes is directly related to the density with which fitness
peaks are distributed in these landscapes.

having smallest A=x'+y'sqrt(d)). Lagrange showed that every solution can easily
be constructed from A so given d it suffices to compute A. It is known that A
can be exponentially large in d so just to write down A we need exponential
time in the input size log d. Hence we introduce the regulator R=ln A and ask
for the value of R to n decimal places. The best known classical algorithm has
sub-exponential running time O(exp(sqrt(log d)), poly(n)). Hallgren's quantum
algorithm gives the result in polynomial time O(poly(log d),poly(n)) with
probability 1/poly(log d). The idea of the algorithm falls into two parts:
using the formalism of algebraic number theory we convert the problem of
solving Pell's equation into the problem of determining R as the period of a
function on the real numbers. Then we generalise the quantum Fourier transform
period finding algorithm to work in this situation of an irrational period on
the (not finitely generated) abelian group of real numbers.

acquaintance with algebraic number theory; we give a self contained account of

needed. Then we go on to describe Hallgren's generalisation of the quantum

Virginis (RT Vir), which have been made with the Very Long Baseline Array
(VLBA) of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) at five epochs, each
separated by three weeks of time. We detected about 60 maser features at each
epoch. Overall, 61 features, detected at least twice, were tracked by their
radial velocities and proper motions. The 3-D maser kinematics exhibited a
circumstellar envelope that is expanding roughly spherically with a velocity of
about 8 km/s. Asymmetries in both the spatial and velocity distributions of the
maser features were found in the envelope, but less significant than that found
in other semiregular variables. Systematic radial-velocity drifts of individual
maser features were found with amplitudes of <= 2 km/s/yr. For one maser
feature, we found a quadratic position shift with time along a straight line on
the sky. This apparent motion indicates an acceleration with an amplitude of 33
km/s/yr, implying the passage of a shock wave driven by the stellar pulsation
of RT Vir. The acceleration motion is likely seen only on the sky plane because
of a large velocity gradient formed in the accelerating maser region. We
estimated the distance to RT Vir to be about 220 pc on the basis of both the
statistical parallax and model-fitting methods for the maser kinematics.

the continuum region is compact and heavily absorbed. The absorber has variable
column density and is composed of both neutral and ionized gas, which can
explain the stochastic and periodic X-ray intensity dips, the X-ray continuum
evolution, and the O VII and Mg XI K-shell absorption edges. The absorber is
located 8 to 15 deg above the disk midplane, inclusive of two bulges near the

Weak MgII absorption lines in quasar spectra trace metal-enriched environments
that are rarely closely associated with the most luminous galaxies (>0.05L^*).
The two weak MgII systems at z=0.81 and z=0.90 are constrained to have >=solar
metallicity, while the metallicity of the z=0.65 system is not as
well-constrained, but is consistent with >1/10th solar. These weak MgII clouds
are likely to be local pockets of high metallicity in a lower metallicity
environment. All three systems have two phases of gas, a higher density region
that produces narrower absorption lines for low ionization transitions, such as
MgII, and a lower density region that produces broader absorption lines for
high ionization transitions, such as CIV. The CIV profile for one system (at
z=0.81) can be fit with a single broad component (b~10 km/s), but those for the
other two systems require one or two additional offset high ionization clouds.
Two possible physical pictures for the phase structure are discussed: one with
a low-ionization, denser phase embedded in a lower density surrounding medium,
and the other with the denser clumps surrounding more highly ionized gas.

atmospheres of halo stars and 3D non-LTE radiative transfer calculations. These
are the first detailed 3D non-LTE computations reported employing a multi-level

the low derived Li abundances found by Asplund et al. (1999) are an artifact of
their assumption of LTE. Relative to 3D LTE, the detailed calculations show
pronounced over-ionization. In terms of abundances the 3D non-LTE values are
within 0.05 dex of the 1D non-LTE results for the particular cases of HD140283

  Issue 2003) in press",,"10.1086/374948",,"astro-ph",,"  (abbreviated) We show that there is a limit relation between the black hole
mass and the width at the half maximum of H$\beta$ for active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) with super-Eddington accretion rates. When a black hole has a
super-Eddington accretion rate, the empirical relation of reverberation mapping
has two possible ways. First, it reduces to a relation between the black hole
mass and the size of the broad line region due to the photon trapping effects
inside the accretion disk. For the Kaspi et al.'s empirical reverberation
relation, we get the limit relation as $M_{\rm BH}=(2.9 - 12.6)\times
10^6M_{\odot} (\upsilon_{\rm FWHM}/10^3{\rm km s^{-1}})^{6.67}$, called as the
Eddington limit. Second, the Eddington limit luminosity will be relaxed if the
trapped photons can escape from the magnetized super-Eddington accretion disk
via the photon bubble instability, and the size of the broad line region will
be enlarged according to the empirical reverberation relation, leading to a
relatively narrow width of H$\beta$. We call this the Begelman limit.
  Super-Eddington accretions in a sample composed of 164 AGNs have been
searched by this limit relation. We find there are a handful of objects locate
between the Eddington and Begelman limit lines, they may be candidates of
super-Eddington accretors in a hybrid structure of photon trapping and photon
bubble instability. The maximum width of H$\beta$ is in the reange of $(3.0 -
3.8)\times 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$ for the maximum mass black holes with
super-Eddington accretion rates among AGNs. We suggest that this limit relation
is more reliable and convenient to test whether a source is super-Eddington and
useful to probe the structure of the super-Eddington accretion process.

from 0 to $\sim$45 and it reflects the concentration of the extinction in the
spiral arms. Based on their locations in color-magnitude diagrams and a few
cross-identifications with IRAS and MSX sources, the nature of objects is
discussed in comparison with the case of a low extinction field in Baade's

no intrinsic absorption in addition to the Galactic absorption (N_{H}~3 x 10^20

absorption lines suggesting that if there is a warm absorber, it either has a
relatively low column density, or a very high ionization parameter. The RGS

However other interpretations are not definitely excluded. The 2-10 keV energy

The radio spectral index of IRS4 (alpha = 1.7 +/- 0.3) is consistent with

probably a jet-induced shock occurring in the circumstellar material. As the
only Class I protostar with a 'thermal jet' IRS4 is the strongest candidate for
the central source of the molecular outflow found previously in the region. The

that two variables (V152, V182) are about 50% more massive than typical RR
Lyrae stars, while the bulk of the Anomalous Cepheids are roughly a factor of
two more massive than fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars. This finding supports
the evidence that these objects are intermediate-mass stars during central He
burning phases. The data for Carina, together with data available in the

model can explain the observed X-ray properties approximately. We obtain from
the comparison with observations that a fraction of $\sim 0.1$ of the pulsar
spin-down luminosity should be transformed into the relativistic electrons and
positrons. We find that the magnetization parameter of the pulsar wind, the
ratio of the Poynting flux to the kinetic energy flux, is $\sim 0.1$

decrease with distance from the pulsar. We predict the flux of 10 MeV - 100 GeV

amount of hot gas available for accretion. Theoretical understanding of this
fact rests on a likely but not entirely certain assumption that the electrons
in the accreting gas are much cooler than the protons. In this case the hot gas
as a whole is too hot to accrete, and is too tenous to radiate away its
gravitational energy. Here we propose a drastically different picture of the
accretion process in Sgr A* not based on the unchecked two-temperature
assumption. Namely, we argue that there should exist a very cold inactive disk
-- a remnant of a past stronger accretion activity in Sgr A*. Such a disk would
be a very efficient cooling surface for the hot flow. We show that under
certain conditions the cooling due to thermal conduction cannot be balanced by
the viscous heating in the hot flow. Along with the heat, the hot flow loses
its viscosity and thus ability to accrete. It settles (condences) onto the cold
disk slighlty inside of the circularization radius. If the latter is very
large, then the liberated energy, and the luminosity emitted, is orders of
magnitude less than naively expected. We build a simple analytical model for
this flow and calculate the expected spectra that appear to be in a very
reasonble agreement with observations. Strong additional support for the
presence of the inactive disk comes from the recent observations of X-ray
flares in Sgr A*. The properties of these flares are very similar to those
produced by stars passing through a cold disk.

Within the non-crossing approximation, we calculate the total density of states

both the parallel and the anti-parallel alignments of the spin polarization
orientation in the leads, followed by a brief discussion regarding the validity
of this approach. Numerical calculations show that for the anti-parallel
alignment, a single Kondo peak always appears in the equilibrium DOS, resulting
in the conventional temperature behavior in the linear conductance and the
zero-bias maximum in the differential conductance. The strength of the DOS peak
is gradually suppressed with increasing polarization, due to the fact that
formation of the Kondo-correlated state is more difficult in the presence of
higher polarization. On the contrary, for the parallel configuration the Kondo
peak in the DOS descends precipitately and splits into two peaks to form a very
steep valley between them. This splitting contributes to the appearance of a
""hump"" in the temperature-dependent linear conductance and a nonzero-bias
maximum in the differential conductance. Moreover, application of a bias
voltage can split each Kondo peak into two in the nonequilibrium DOS for both
configurations. Finally we point out that the tunnel magnetoresistance could be
an effective tool to demonstrate the different Kondo effects in different spin
configurations found here.

prominent Drude peak and a high-frequency preformed pair continuum, split by
sharp excitonic peaks arising due to an approximate SO(8) symmetry. For very

A$_g$ states, PA can also occur to a higher energy kA$_g$ state whose 2e--2h

involving both delocalized and localized bands. Our calculated scaled energies

boxes. First the black hole mass evolution is analyzed in an initially empty
box. Using the conservation of the energy and the Hawking evaporation flux, we
deduce a minimal volume above which one black hole can loss all of its mass to
the box, a result which agrees with the previous analysis made by Page. We then
obtain analogous results using a box initially containing radiation, allowed to
be absorbed by the black hole. The equilibrium times and masses are evaluated
and their behavior discussed to highlight some interesting features arising.
These results are generalized to $N$ black holes + thermal radiation. Using
physically simple arguments, we prove that these black holes achieve the same
equilibrium masses (even that the initial masses were different). The entropy
of the system is used to obtain the dependence of the equilibrium mass on the
box volume, number of black holes and the initial radiation. The equilibrium
mass is shown to be proportional to a {\it positive} power law of the effective
volume (contrary to naive expectations), a result explained in terms of the
detailed features of the system. The effect of the reflection of the radiation
on the box walls which comes back into the black hole is explicitly considered.
All these results (some of them counter-intuitive) may be useful to formulate
alternative problems in thermodynamic courses for graduate and advanced
undergraduate students. A handful of them are suggested in the Appendix.

are a natural candidate for the dark matter of the universe, and indeed were
the first particles to be proposed for this role. This possibility has however
been increasingly constrained by cosmological considerations, particularly of
large-scale structure formation, thus yielding stringent bounds on neutrino
masses, which have yet to be matched by laboratory experiments. Another probe
of relic neutrinos is primordial nucleosynthesis which is sensitive to the
number of neutrino types (including possible sterile species) as well to any
lepton asymmetry. Combining such arguments with the experimental finding that
neutrino mixing angles are large, excludes the possibility of a large asymmetry
and disfavours new neutrinos beyond those now known.

radiates an additional energy fraction due to scattering in spatially extended

length, it includes the case of a dynamically expanding medium, and it extends
to the angular dependence of the medium-induced gluon radiation pattern. All
calculations are done in the multiple soft scattering approximation
(Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peign\'e-Schiff--Zakharov ``BDMPS-Z''-formalism) and
in the single hard scattering approximation (N=1 opacity approximation). By
comparison, we establish a simple relation between transport coefficient, Debye
screening mass and opacity, for which both approximations lead to comparable
results. Together with this paper, a CPU-inexpensive numerical subroutine for
calculating quenching weights is provided electronically. To illustrate its
applications, we discuss the suppression of hadronic transverse momentum
spectra in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Remarkably, the kinematic constraint
resulting from finite in-medium path length reduces significantly the
transverse momentum dependence of the nuclear modification factor, thus leading
to consistency with the data measured at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider

-> X^0 + 2 pi i, these configurations have intriguing similarities to black
hole or de Sitter geometries. For example, the open string pair production as
seen by an Unruh detector is thermal at temperature T = 1/4 pi. It is shown
that, despite the rapid time dependence of the s-brane, there exists an exactly
thermal mixed state of open strings. The corresponding boundary state is
constructed for both the bosonic and superstring cases. This state defines a
long-distance Euclidean effective field theory whose light modes are confined
to the s-brane. At the critical value of the coupling lambda=1/2, the boundary
interaction simply generates an SU(2) rotation by pi from Neumman to Dirichlet
boundary conditions. The lambda=1/2 s-brane reduces to an array of sD-branes
(D-branes with a transverse time dimension) on the imaginary time axis. The

the integral closedness of ${\mathfrak m}I$. The latter question is motivated

normal form is constructed in flat space. We present an example taken from the

quantum mechanics to solve the prime factorization problem on a spin ensemble
without any quantum entanglement. The ensemble quantum computation for the
prime factorization is based on the basic principle that both a closed quantum
system and its ensemble obey the same unitary dynamics of quantum mechanics if
there is not any decoherence effect in both the quantum system and its
ensemble. It uses the NMR multiple-quantum measurement techniques to output the
quantum computational results that are the inphase multiple-quantum spectra of
the spin ensemble. It has been shown that the inphase NMR multiple-quantum
spectral intensities used to search for the period of the modular exponential
function may reduce merely in a polynomial form as the qubit number of the spin
ensemble. The time evolution process of the modular exponential operation on
the quantum computer obeys the unitary dynamics of quantum mechanics and hence
the computational output is governed by the quantum dynamics. This essential
difference between the quantum computer and the classical one could be the key
point for the quantum computation outperforming the classical one in the prime
factorization on a spin ensemble without any quantum entanglement. It has been
shown that the prime factorization based on the quantum dynamics on a spin
ensemble is locally efficient at least. This supports the conjecture that the
quantum dynamics could play an important role for the origin of power of
quantum computation and quantum entanglement could not be a unique resource to
achieve power of quantum computation in the prime factorization.

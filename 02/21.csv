Chandra Deep Field South. This galaxy was selected as an `i-drop' from the
GOODS public survey imaging with HST/ACS (object 3 in Stanway, Bunker & McMahon
2003, astro-ph/0302212). The large colour of (i'-z')_AB=1.6 indicated a
spectral break consistent with the Lyman-alpha forest absorption short-ward of
Lyman-alpha at z~6. The galaxy is very compact (marginally resolved with ACS
with a half-light radius of 0.08arcsec, so r_hl<0.5kpc/h_70). We have obtained
a deep (5.5-hour) spectrum of this z'(AB)=24.7 galaxy with the DEIMOS optical
spectrograph on Keck, and here we report the discovery of a single emission
line centred on 8245Ang detected at 20sigma with a flux of f~2E-17 ergs/s/cm^2.
The line is clearly resolved with detectable structure at our resolution of
better than 55km/s, and the only plausible interpretation consistent with the
ACS photometry is that we are seeing Lyman-alpha emission from a z=5.78 galaxy.
This is the highest redshift galaxy to be discovered and studied using HST
data. The velocity width Delta(v)_FWHM=260km/s and rest-frame equivalent width
(W=20Ang) indicate that this line is most probably powered by star formation,
as an AGN would typically have larger values. The starburst interpretation is
supported by our non-detection of the high-ionization NV1240Ang emission line,
and the absence of this source from the deep Chandra X-ray images. The star
formation rate inferred from the rest-frame UV continuum is 34M_sun/yr/h^2_70
(Omega_M=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7). This is the most luminous starburst known at
z>5. Our spectroscopic redshift for this object confirms the validity of the
i'-drop technique of Stanway, Bunker & McMahon (2003) to select star-forming
galaxies at z~6.

the WMAP data implies that significant reionization took place at redshifts
z~15. This discovery has important implications for the sources of
reionization, and allows, for the first time, constraints to be placed on
physical reionization scenarios out to redshift z~20. Using a new suite of
semi-analytic reionization models, we show that the high value of tau requires
a surprisingly high efficiency epsilon of the first generation of UV sources
for injecting ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium. We find that no
simple reionization model can be consistent with the combination of the WMAP
result with data from the z<6.5 universe. Satisfying both constraints requires
either of the following: (i) H_2 molecules form efficiently at z~20, survive
feedback processes, and allow UV sources in halos with virial temperatures
below Tvir=10^4 K to contribute substantially to reionization, or (ii) the
efficiency epsilon in halos with Tvir>10^4K decreased by a factor of ~ 30
between (z~20) and (z~6). We discuss the relevant physical issues to produce
either scenario, and argue that both options are viable, and allowed by current
data. In detailed models of the reionization history, we find that the
evolution of the ionized fractions in the two scenarios have distinctive
features that Planck can distinguish at 3 sigma significance. At the high WMAP
value for tau, Planck will also be able to provide tight statistical
constraints on reionization model parameters, and elucidate much of the physics
at the end of the Dark Ages. The sources responsible for the high optical depth
discovered by WMAP should be directly detectable out to z~15 by the James Webb
Space Telescope.

CMB. If tau is estimated with a single sharp transition we show that there can
be a significant bias in the derived value (and therefore a bias in sigma8 as
well). For WMAP noise levels the bias in tau is smaller than the statistical
uncertainty, but for Planck or a cosmic variance limited experiment the tau
bias could be much larger than the statistical uncertainties. This bias can be
reduced in the ionization models we consider by fitting a slightly more
complicated ionization history, such as a two-step ionization process. Assuming
this two-step process we find the Planck satellite can simultaneously determine
the initial redshift of reionization to +-2 and tau to +-0.01 Uncertainty about
the ionization history appears to provide a limit of about 0.005 on how well
tau can be estimated from CMB polarization data, much better than expected from
WMAP but significantly worse than expected from cosmic-variance limits.

substantially from l_RM, the observationally easily accessible autocorrelation

study, which does not take this distinction into account, likely underestimates
the magnetic field strength. For power-law magnetic power spectra, and for
patchy magnetic field configurations the central RM autocorrelation function is
shown to have characteristic asymptotic shapes. Ways to constrain the volume

built from the accretion of discrete, stable subclusters. Any ``cooling flow''
present is overwhelmed by the velocity field within the cluster - the bulk flow
of gas through the cluster typically has speeds up to about 2,000 km s^-1 and
significant rotation is frequently present in the cluster core. The inclusion
of consistent initial cosmological conditions for the cluster within its
surrounding supercluster environment is crucial when simulating the evolution
of cool cores in rich galaxy clusters. This new model for the hierarchical

rich galaxy clusters despite the fact that a majority of these clusters show
evidence of substructure which is believed to arise from recent merger

WMAP, the CMB now offers a significantly stronger constraint on \eta. We
discuss the current state of BBN theory and light element observations

baryon density prediction is in overall agreement with the WMAP prediction, an
important and non-trivial confirmation of hot big bang cosmology. Going beyond
this, the powerful CMB baryometer can be used as an input to BBN and one can
accurately predict the primordial light element abundances. By comparing these
with observations one can obtain new insight into post-BBN nucleosynthesis
processes and associated astrophysics. Finally, one can test the possibility of
nonstandard physics at the time of BBN, now with all light elements available
as probes. Indeed, with the WMAP precision \eta, deuterium is already beginning
to rival \he4's sensitivity to nonstandard physics, and additional D/H

measure the space density of galaxies, and show that this is a robust method,
insensitive to the effects of large scale structure. The resulting HI mass
function can be fitted satisfactorily with a Schechter function with faint-end

with later type galaxies giving steeper slopes. We extensively test various
effects that potentially bias the determination of the HI mass function,
including peculiar motions of galaxies, large scale structure, selection bias,
and inclination effects, and quantify these biases. The large sample of
galaxies enables an accurate measurement of the cosmological mass density of
neutral gas: Omega_HI=(3.8 +/- 0.6) x 10^{-4}. Low surface brightness galaxies
contribute only 15% to this value, consistent with previous findings.

differs from the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) mainly in the formation
history and large-scale distribution of low-mass haloes, which form later and
tend to be more clustered in WDM than in CDM universes, tracing more closely
the filamentary structures of the cosmic web. Therefore, we focus our
computational effort in this paper on one particular filament extracted from a
WDM cosmological simulation and compare in detail its evolution to that of the

fragmentation within the filament is broadly peaked around a Jeans mass of a

with an overdensity contrast around 10 at these redshifts. Our results confirm
that WDM filaments fragment and form gravitationally bound haloes in a top-down
fashion, whereas CDM filaments are built bottom-up, thus demonstrating the
impact of the nature of the dark matter on dwarf galaxy properties.

with a cluster-mass scale of between 7*10^{13}Msolar/h and 6*10^{15}Msolar/h. A
detailed comparison of the genus for dark matter halos with that for the mass
distribution shows that the non-Gaussianity induced by the halo biasing is
comparable to that by nonlinear gravitational evolution, and both the shape and
the amplitude of the genus are almost insensitive to the halo mass at
R_G>30Mpc/h. In order to characterize the biasing effect on the genus, we apply
a perturbative formula developed by Matsubara (1994). We find that the
perturbative formula well describes the simulated halo genus at R_G>50Mpc/h.
The result indicates that the biasing effect on the halo genus is well
approximated by nonlinear deterministic biasing up to the second-order term in
the mass density fluctuation. The two parameters describing the linear and
quadratic terms in the nonlinear biasing accurately specify the genus for
galaxy clusters.

X-ray background (SXRB) produced by the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM)
associated with dark halos, motivated primarily by searching for missing
baryons and distinguishing different physical processes of the WHIM in dark
halos. We employ a purely analytic model for the halo population which is
completely determined by the universal density profile and the Press-Schechter
mass function. We then adopt a phenomenological approach to nongravitational
processes of the WHIM such as preheating and radiative cooling. It shows that
the power spectra of the SXRB predicted by three WHIM models, namely, the
self-similar model, preheating model and cooling model demonstrate remarkably
different signatures in both amplitude and shape, with the peak locations
moving from 4X10^4 for the self-similar model to a smaller value of (3-5)X10^3
when nongravitational processes are taken into account. The corresponding ACFs
for preheating and cooling models become shallower too as compared with the
prediction of the self-similar model. This may permit an effective probe of the
physical processes of the WHIM in massive halos in conjunction with the
observationally determined power spectrum or ACF of the SXRB from diffuse WHIM.
However, a direct comparison of our theoretical predictions with existing data
(e.g. the ACF determined from ROSAT observations) is still difficult because of
the dominant contribution of AGNs in the soft X-ray sky. We discuss briefly the
implication of our results for resolving the missing baryon problem in the
local universe.

the emission of the dust we use amorphous carbon, hydrogenated amorphous
carbon, magnesium sulfide and titanium carbide. We present a detailed
parametrisation of the optical properties of hydrogenated amorphous carbon as a
function of H/C content. The mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy is best
reproduced by a single dust shell from 1.2 to 2.6 arcsec radius around the
central star. This shell originates from a short period during which the
mass-loss rate exceeded 10^(-4) M_sun/yr. We find that the strength of the
``21'' micron feature poses a problem for the TiC identification. The low
abundance of Ti requires very high absorption cross-sections in the ultraviolet
and visible wavelength range to explain the strength of the feature. Other
nano-crystalline metal carbides should be considered as well. We find that
hydrogenated amorphous carbon in radiative equilibrium with the local radiation
field does not reach a high enough temperature to explain the strength of the
3.3-3.4 and 6-9 micron hydrocarbon features relative to the 11-17 micron
hydrocarbon features. We propose that the carriers of these hydrocarbon
features are not in radiative equilibrium but are transiently heated to high
temperature. We find that 2 per cent of the dust mass is required to explain
the strength of the ``30'' micron feature, which fits well within the measured
atmospheric abundance of Mg and S. This further strengthens the MgS
identification of the ``30'' micron feature.

is expected to remove the gas from the core of the cluster first, as that is

For lower values of star formation efficiency down to 20%, a reduced core
survives containing the majority of the massive stars while some of them are
dispersed into the rest of the cluster. In fact we find that ejected stars
migrate from radial to tangential orbits due to stellar encounters once they
leave the core. Thus, the location of massive stars outside of the core does
not exclude their forming in the dense cluster core. Few massive stars are
expected to remain in the core for a star formation efficiency lower than 20%.

Beginning with the mass function of dark matter halos, we show how gas cooling,
photoionization, feedback, merging and thermal conduction affect the shape of
the luminosity function. We consider three processes whereby supernovae can
affect the forming galaxy: (1) reheating of disk gas to the halo temperature;
(2) expansion of the diffuse halo gas; (3) expulsion of cold disk gas from the
halo. While feedback of form (1) is able to flatten the faint end of the
luminosity function, this alone does not produce the sharp cut-off observed at
large luminosities. Feedback of form (2) is also unable to solve this problem.
The relative paucity of very bright galaxies can only be explained if cooling
in massive halos is strongly suppressed. Conduction is a promising mechanism,
but an uncomfortably high efficiency is required to suppress cooling to the
desired level. If, instead, superwinds are responsible for the lack of bright
galaxies, then the total energy budget required to obtain a good match to the
galaxy luminosity function greatly exceeds the energy available from supernova
explosions. The mechanism is only viable if the formation of central
supermassive black holes play a crucial role in limiting the amount of stars
that form in the host galaxy. (abridged)

simulations of a large and representative region of a universe which has
cosmological parameters consistent with the WMAP results. Our simulations
follow both the radiative transfer of ionizing photons and the formation and
evolution of the galaxy population which produces them. A previously published

structure was refined (r < 27A; R = 12.9%) using the PDF data. 85% of all atoms
show Frank-Kasper (FK) type coordinations. Basic structural unit is the
3-shell, 104-atom Bergman cluster (d = 15A comprising a void at its center. The
clusters are interconnected sharing common edges and hexagonal faces of the 3rd
shells. The remaining space is filled by some glue atoms (9% of all atoms),
yielding an almost tetrahedrally close packed structure. All Ho atoms are
surrounded by 16 neighbours (FK-polyhedron ""P""). Most of them (89%) are
situated in the 2nd shell (pentagon dodecahedron), the other act as glue atoms.
As a result and as can be expected for real matter, local atomic coordinations
in quasicrystals are similar compared to common crystalline intermetallic
compounds. From our results, the long range quasiperiodic structure of
icosahedral Mg-Zn-RE (RE = Y and some rare earths) is anticipated to be a
canonical cell tiling (CCT, after Henely) decorated with Bergman clusters.

  semiconductors","6 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  The electronic structure of diluted (Ga,Mn)As magnetic semiconductors in the
presence of As-antisites and magnetic disorder is studied within the framework
of the local spin density approximation. Both the chemical and magnetic
disorders are treated using the coherent potential approximation. A ground
state with partial disorder in the local moments and with a reduced total
magnetic moment appears in the presence of As-antisites. We first estimate the
Curie temperature T_c from total energy differences between the ferromagnetic
and the paramagnetic state by identifying these with the corresponding energy
difference in a classical Heisenberg model. A more systematic approach within
the framework of the mean-field approximation to estimate T_c consists in an
evaluation of the effective exchange fields acting on the magnetic moment at a
given site. The presence of As-antisites strongly reduces the Curie
temperature. The results indicate that the effect of impurities on the
electronic structure cannot be neglected and influences the Curie temperature
non-negligibly. A comparison of the calculated Curie temperatures to existing
experimental data indicates an increase of the donor concentration with the
increase of the Mn-content.

two ways: it constrains the local overdensity of neutrino dark matter which is
not helpful, but it also limits the resonant energy to a favorable range. In

give a proof of the spectral theorem for symplectic transformations of
classical mechanics, demonstrate the coincidence of the symplectic group
$Sp(2n)$ with the real subgroup of a matrix group that is isomorphic to the
pseudo-unitary group U(n,n), and elaborate on an approach to second
quantization that makes use of the underlying pseudo-unitary dynamical groups.

Interaction of the beam with the clusters causes them break into smaller ones

quantum mapping, i.e. to teleport the quantum state of a single mode radiation
field onto the collective state of atoms with a given momentum out of a
Bose-Einstein condensate. The atoms-radiation entanglement needed for the
teleportation protocol is established through the interaction of a single mode
with the condensate in presence of a strong far off-resonant pump laser,
whereas the coherent atomic displacement is obtained by the same interaction
with the radiation in a classical coherent field. In principle, verification of
the protocol requires a joint measurement on the recoiling atoms and the
condensate, however, a partial verification involving populations, i.e.
diagonal matrix elements may be obtained through counting atoms experiments.

partners so that leaving out any number of them, the rest do not have the
complete information. Strong multiqubit correlations in the state by which
secret sharing is carried out, had been proposed as a criterion for security of
such protocols against individual attacks by an eavesdropper. However we show
that states with weak multiqubit correlations can also be used for secure
secret sharing. That our state has weak multiqubit correlations, is shown from
the perspective of violation of local realism, and also by showing that its
higher order correlations are described by lower ones. We then present a
unified criterion for security of secret sharing in terms of violation of local
realism, which works when the secret sharing state is the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state (with strong multiqubit correlations), as
well as states of a different class (with weak multiqubit correlations).

known eigenstates and eigenvalues of a number of quasi-exactly solvable
Hamiltonians, but also construct a convergent approximation scheme for locating
those levels, not amenable to analytical treatments. The fact that, the above
method yields an expansion of the wave functions in terms of corresponding
energies, enables one to treat energy as a variational parameter, which can be
effectively used for the identification of the eigenstates. It is particularly
useful for the quasi-exactly solvable systems, where the ground state is known
and a number of eigenstates are bounded, both below and above. The efficacy of
the procedure is illustrated by obtaining, the low-lying excited states of a
prototypical double-well potential, where the conventional techniques are not
very reliable. Our approach yields the approximate eigenfunctions and
eigenvalues, whose accuracy can be improved to any desired level, in a
controlled manner. Comparing the present results with those of an independent
numerical method, it was found that, the first few terms in our approximate
solutions are enough to yield the excited state eigenvalues, accurate upto the
third place of the decimal.

information processing by the universe? We find that an affirmative answer has
important consequences for the measurement problem. In particular, we calculate
the amount of quantum information processing involved in the evolution of
physical systems, assuming a finite degree of fine-graining of Hilbert space.
This assumption is shown to imply that there is a finite capacity to sustain
the immense entanglement that measurement entails. When this capacity is
overwhelmed, the system's unitary evolution becomes computationally unstable
and the system suffers an information transition (`collapse'). Classical
behaviour arises from the rapid cycles of unitary evolution and information
transitions.
  Thus, the fine-graining of Hilbert space determines the location of the
`Heisenberg cut', the mesoscopic threshold separating the microscopic, quantum
system from the macroscopic, classical environment. The model can be viewed as
a probablistic complement to decoherence, that completes the measurement
process by turning decohered improper mixtures of states into proper mixtures.
It is shown to provide a natural resolution to the measurement problem and the
basis problem.

uses discrete time steps, and contains, besides the particle making the walk, a
second quantum system, the coin, that determines the direction in which the
particle will move. The continuous walk operates with continuous time. Here a
third model for a quantum walk is proposed, which is based on an analogy to
optical interferometers. It is a discrete-time model, and the unitary operator
that advances the walk one step depends only on the local structure of the
graph on which the walk is taking place. No quantum coin is introduced. This
type of walk allows us to introduce elements, such as phase shifters, that have
no counterpart in classical random walks. Walks on the line and cycle are
discussed in some detail, and a probability current for these walks is
introduced. The relation to the coined quantum walk is also discussed. The
paper concludes by showing how to define these walks for a general graph.

the difficulties that standard quantum mechanics meets in accounting for the

consideration of nonlinear and stochastic modifications of the Schroedinger
equation. The proposed new dynamics is characterized by the feature of not
contradicting any known fact about microsystems and of accounting, on the basis
of a unique, universal dynamical principle, for wavepacket reduction and for
the classical behavior of macroscopic systems. We recall the motivations for
the new approach and we briefly review the other proposals to circumvent the
above mentioned difficulties which appeared in the literature. In this way we
make clear the conceptual and historical context characterizing the new
approach. After having reviewed the mathematical techniques (stochastic
differential calculus) which are essential for the rigorous and precise
formulation of the new dynamics, we discuss in great detail its implications
and we stress its relevant conceptual achievements. The new proposal requires
also to work out an appropriate interpretation; a procedure which leads us to a
reconsideration of many important issues about the conceptual status of
theories based on a genuinely Hilbert space description of natural processes.
We also discuss the possibility and the problems one meets in trying to develop
an analogous formalism for the relativistic case. Finally we discuss the
experimental implications of the new dynamics for various physical processes
which should allow, in principle, to test it against quantum mechanics.

tau_e = 0.17 +- 0.04 is consistent with a simple model of reionization in which
the intergalactic medium (IGM) is ionized at redshift z ~ 15, and remains
highly ionized thereafter. Here, we show that existing measurements of the IGM
temperature from the Lyman-alpha forest at z ~ 2 - 4 rule out this ``vanilla''
model. Under reasonable assumptions about the ionizing spectrum, as long as the
universe is reionized before z = 10, and remains highly ionized thereafter, the
IGM reaches an asymptotic thermal state which is too cold compared to
observations. To simultaneously satisfy the CMB and forest constraints, the
reionization history must be complex: reionization begins early at z >~ 15, but
there must have been significant (order unity) changes in fractions of neutral
hydrogen and/or helium at 6 < z < 10, and/or singly ionized helium at 4 < z <
10. We describe a physically motivated reionization model that satisfies all
current observations. We also explore the impact of a stochastic reionization
history and show that a late epoch of (HeII --> HeIII) reionization induces a
significant scatter in the IGM temperature, but the scatter diminishes with
time quickly. Finally, we provide an analytic formula for the thermal
asymptote, and discuss possible additional heating mechanisms that might evade
our constraints.

  Observations of Seyfert galaxies in X-ray region reveal the broad emissiion
lines in their spectra, which can arise in inner parts of accretion disks,
where the effects of General Relativity (GR) must be counted. A spectrum of a
solitary emission line (the $K_\alpha$-line of iron, for example) of a hot spot
in Kerr accretion disk is simulated, depending on the radial coordinate $r$ and
the angular momentum $a=J/M$ of a black hole, under the assumption of an
equatorial circular motion of a hot spot. Using results of numerical
simulations it is shown that the characteristic two-peak line profile with the
sharp edges arises at a large distance, (about $r \approx (3-10)r_g$). The
inner regions emit the line, which is observed with one maximum and extremely
broad red wing. High accuracy future spectral observations, being carried out,
could detect the angular momentum $a$ of the black hole. We analyzed the
different parameters of problems on the observable shape of this line and
discussed some possible kinds of these shapes. The total number of geodesics is
about $10^9$ (to simulate possible shapes of the $K_\alpha$-line), so the
number is great enough, especially in comparison with few geodesics in the

generalised formula based upon the results of cosmological N-body simulations.
Its inner slope (cuspy or flat), concentration, and mass within the virial
radius are kept as free parameters, as well as the velocity anisotropy, assumed
independent of position. We show that the study of line-of-sight velocity
dispersion alone does not allow to constrain the parameters. By a joint
analysis of the observed profiles of velocity dispersion and kurtosis we are
able to break the degeneracy between the mass distribution and velocity
anisotropy. We determine the dark matter distribution at radial distances
larger than 3% of the virial radius and we find that the galaxy orbits are
close to isotropic. Due to limited resolution, different inner slopes are found
to be consistent with the data and we observe a strong degeneracy between the
inner slope $\alpha$ and concentration $c$: the best-fitting profiles have the
two parameters related with $c=19 - 9.6 \alpha$. Our best-fitting NFW profile
has concentration $c=9$, which is 50% higher than standard values found in
cosmological simulations for objects of similar mass. The total mass within the
virial radius of $2.9 h_{70}^{-1}$ Mpc is $1.4 \times 10^{15} h_{70}^{-1}

contamination by low-z objects to be ~ 20%. We find that the LAE candidates are
clustered in an elongated region on the sky of 20 Mpc in width and 50 Mpc in
length at z=4.86, which is comparable in size to present-day large-scale
structures (we adopt H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Omega0=0.3, lambda0=0.7). This elongated
region includes a circular region of 12 Mpc radius of higher surface
overdensity (delta=2), which may be the progenitor of a cluster of galaxies.
Assuming this circular region to be a sphere with a spatial overdensity of 2,
we compare our observation with predictions by Cold Dark Matter models. We find
that an Omega0=0.3 flat model with sigma8=0.9 predicts the number of such
spheres consistent with the observed number (one sphere in our survey volume)
if the bias parameter of LAEs is b \simeq 6. This value suggests that the
typical mass of dark haloes hosting LAEs at z \simeq 5 is of the order of 10^12
Msolar. Such a large mass poses an interesting question about the nature of

direct interaction between the pathologic (PrPsc) form and the host encoded

the overall features of the incubation time of prion diseases are readily
obtained if the prion reaction is described by a simple mean-field model. An
analytical expression for the incubation time distribution then follows by
associating the rate constant to a stochastic variable log normally
distributed. The incubation time distribution is then also shown to be log
normal and fits the observed BSE data very well. The basic ideas of the
theoretical model are then incorporated in a cellular automata model. The
computer simulation results yield the correct BSE incubation time distribution
at low densities of the host encoded protein.

of the transition amplitude in quantum field theories, and the relation of this

of these structures the power sum symmetric functionals of the perturbative

Hall polynomials, or diagrammatically by Hall trees. We show that each Hall
tree corresponds to sums of Feynman diagrams each with the same number of
vertices, external legs and loops. In addition, since the Lie subalgebra admits
a derivation endomorphism, we also show that with respect to it these
primitives are cyclic vectors generated by the free propagator, and thus
provide a recursion relation by means of which the (n+1)-vertex connected Green
functions can be derived systematically from the n-vertex ones.

been investigated using a many-body Gupta potential and microcanonical
molecular dynamics simulations. Negative heat capacities around the cluster
melting-like transition have been obtained for N = 135, 142, and 147, but the
smaller clusters (N = 13, 20, and 55) do not show this peculiarity. By
performing a survey of the cluster potential energy landscape (PEL), it is
found that the width of the distribution function of the kinetic energy and the
spread of the distribution of potential energy minima (isomers), are useful
features to determine the different behavior of the heat capacity as a function
of the cluster size. The effect of the range of the interatomic forces is
studied by comparing the heat capacities of the Na_55 and Cd_55 clusters. It is
shown that by decreasing the range of the many-body interaction, the
distribution of isomers characterizing the PEL is modified appropriately to
generate a negative heat capacity in the Cd_55 cluster.

moments of up to the highest rank $\kappa=2F$ possible for a quantum state with
total angular momentum $F$. The technique is based on nonlinear magneto-optical
rotation with frequency-modulated light. Various polarization moments are
distinguished by the periodicity of light-polarization rotation induced by the
atoms during Larmor precession and exhibit distinct light-intensity and
frequency dependences. We apply the method to study polarization moments of
$^{87}$Rb atoms contained in a vapor cell with antirelaxation coating. Distinct
ultra-narrow (1-Hz wide) resonances, corresponding to different multipoles,
appear in the magnetic-field dependence of the optical rotation. The use of the
highest-multipole resonances has important applications in quantum and
nonlinear optics and in magnetometry.

is, two distant particles can be entangled by sending a third particle that is

entangled by continuous interaction with a highly mixed mediating particle that
never itself becomes entangled. We also consider analogous properties of
completely positive maps, in which the composition of two separable maps can
create entanglement.

of annihilation operators, related to quantum mechanical potential problems, is
presented. These coherent states, by construction are not potential specific

The information about a given quantum mechanical potential enters into these
states, through the orthogonal polynomials associated with it and also through
its ground state wave function. The time evolution of some of these states
exhibit fractional revivals, having relevance to the factorization problem.

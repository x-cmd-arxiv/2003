fields are natural for transmitting the energy from the central compact object
to the small amount of baryons required for a GRB. When dissipation of the flux
of magnetic energy by reconnection inside the flow is taken into account, the
magnetic model assumes several more convincing properties. For baryon loading
typical of observed GRB, most of the dissipation takes place just outside
photosphere, so that prompt emission is produced efficiently, and the magnetic
field strength in this region is high, resulting in efficient synchrotron
emission. Remarkably, the dissipation also causes very efficient acceleration
of the bulk flow. This effect is illustrated with a classical hydrodynamic
equivalent. In this context, the distinction between the flux of magnetic
energy $cB^2/8\pi$ and the Poynting flux $cB^2/4\pi$ is important, and an
interpretation of the Poynting flux as a `magnetic enthalpy flux' illuminating.
Numerical and analytical results for flow acceleration and the relative
contribution of photospheric (thermal) and nonthermal emission as functions of
the asymptotic bulk Lorentz factor are given. The transition between X-ray
flashes and true GRB is predicted at $\Gamma\approx 100$.

  Publishers, Inc. N.Y.; pp. 85 - 108 (2003)",,,"astro-ph",,"  Gravitational tunneling radiation (GTR) from a black hole is similar to
electric field emission of electrons from a metal. There is always a second
body to give the gravitational barrier of a black hole a finite rather than
infinite width so that a particle can escape by tunneling. Thus GTR may be
emitted from black holes in a process differing from that of Hawking radiation
(HR) with broad ranging astrophysical ramifications. HR of an ""isolated"" black
hole is an abstraction which has not been detected in three decades, and which
may not exist. GTR is beamed, in contrast to HR, which is isotropic. Little
black holes may account for much of the dark matter of the universe, and hence
the anomalous rotation of spiral galaxies, as well as contribute to the
accelerated expansion of the universe. The absence of HR permits the existence
of little black hole gravitationally bound atoms with quantized orbits and
quantized gravitational radiation. Since some theories speculate that the early
universe may have existed in n-dimensional space, certain results will be
presented both for general n-space and for the 3-space in which we live. An
inconsistency between quantum mechanics and the equivalence principle is
demonstrated. It is shown that angular momentum cannot be quantized in the
usual manner in 4-space, with possible consequences for Kaluza-Klein theory. An
hypothesis is presented for reducing the enormously too-large vacuum zero-point
energy. String theory may be impacted by the finding that atoms are not
energetically stable in higher than 3-space. GTR avoids the black hole lost
information paradox.

Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) increment near its peak intensity based on Monte
Carlo simulations of sub-millimetre observations of galaxy clusters.
Specifically, we evaluate the contribution of gravitational lensing of high
redshift background sources by a target cluster to its inferred SZ signal. We
find that the background confusion limit is 0.6 mJy per beam without any
lensing. With gravitational lensing, the confusion limit increases to 0.9 mJy
per beam. Removing bright sources in the gravitationally lensed fields
decreases the confusion limit to 0.7 mJy per beam, essentially background
levels. These limits are found by removing exceptionally poor fits to the
expected SZ profile, which are due to the different structure of the SZ and
lensing angular profiles.
  We conclude that experiments designed to measure the SZ increment must have
high enough angular resolution to identify background point sources while
surveying enough of the sky to determine the SZ profile. Observations of the SZ
increment with SCUBA, which has sufficient sensitivity and resolution for the
task, should be straight forward.

  Elsevier",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.str-el",,"  We review recent results on many-body effects in the luminescence from
semiconductor nanostructures. Many-body luminescence from highly excited
quantum-confined structures is conceptually important topic since a new
parameter, a level spacing, plays a crucial role. This spacing is not merely a
discretization of the bulk luminescence spectrum, as it could seem. The
interplay of finite spacing with interactions (even weak) results in a highly
nontrivial sequence of emission lines, their heights revealing the many-body
correlations in the system. Here the complex structure of the emission
spectrum, resulting from the shakeup processes in many-particle (but finite)
system, is demonstrated for a confined electron-hole system of a particular
geometry, in which the interacting carriers are confined to a ring. For this
geometry, the Luttinger liquid theory allows one to exactly calculate the
intensities of all many-body spectral lines. The positions of the lines are
governed by the relation of the level spacings for electrons and holes. While
close to the emission threshold the interactions cause only weak shakeup
satellites of the single-particle lines, away from the threshold the discrete
luminescence spectrum is completely dominated by the many-body transitions. We
describe the Luttinger liquid approach for calculations of optical spectra in
finite one-dimensional systems. The calculations are preceded by a detailed
review of experimental and theoretical work on many-body luminescence from
various infinite systems. We also review the current status of the experimental
and theoretical research on quantum nanorings.

residues when a third residue is between them. We develop statistical alpha
contact potential. A studentized bootstrap method is then introduced for
assessing the 95% confidence intervals for each of the 210 parameters. We found
with confidence that there is significant long range propensity (>30 residues
apart) for hydrophobic interactions. We test alpha contact potential for native
structure discrimination using several decoy sets, and found it often has
comparable performance with atom-based potentials requiring more parameters. We
also show that alpha contact potential has better performance than potential
defined by cut-off distance between geometric centers of side chains.
Clustering of alpha contact potentials reveals natural grouping of residues. To
explore the relationship between shape representation and physicochemical
representation, we test the minimum alphabet size for structure discrimination.
We found that there is no significant difference in discrimination when
alphabet size varies from 7 to 20, if geometry is represented accurately by
alpha simplicial edges. This result suggests that the geometry of packing plays

  velocity on the outflow velocity out of flowing eleme","3 pages",,,,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  It is shown, that the introduction in Saint-Venant -Wantzel formula radicand
of the free component in the form of quadrate of velocity of the incident gas
flow on inlet of flowing element that was offered in the end of the XIX century
and is remained till now it is physically inadequate. It is shown that this way
is doubtful for hydromechanics and it absolutely is not reasonably for
gasdynamics. Physically exact form of writing of static head law for flowing
element and relevant to this, the modern form of Saint-Venant - Wantzel formula
are submitted ad-hoc. The obtained expressions allow physically correctly to
take into account both combined and isolated influence of pressure drop
applying to the flowing element and velocity of incident gas flow on flowing
element, on quantity of the outflow velocity of gas stream out of this flowing
element, system. The obtained expressions are valid for a subsonic velocity of
the incident gas flow. The particular expressions are obtained for liquid.

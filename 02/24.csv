the patterns arise from the addition of two superposed components of nearly

the Lyman continuum luminosity. We find a spectral type dependence, as
predicted by the standard model of an ultracompact ionized hydrogen region,
surrounded by a natal dust shell, with some scatter, which can be understood by
consideration of: 1) dust absorption of some fraction of the emitted Lyman
continuum photons; 2) fainter companion stars within the UCHII region; 3) the
structure of the UCHII regions differing from star to star. Overall, the higher

J0513.9-6951 is proposed based on an optically thick wind model of
mass-accreting white dwarfs (WDs). When the mass accretion rate to a WD exceeds
the critical rate of \sim 1 x 10^{-6} M_\sun yr^{-1}, optically thick strong
winds begin to blow from the WD so that a formation of common envelope is
avoided. The WD can accrete and burn hydrogen-rich matter atop the WD at the
critical rate. The excess matter transferred to the WD above the critical rate
is expelled by winds. This is called the accretion wind evolution. This
ejection process, however, occurs intermittently because the mass transfer is
attenuated by strong winds: the strong winds collide with the secondary surface
and strip off the very surface layer of the secondary. The matter stripped-off
is lost from the binary system. Properly formulating this mass stripping effect
and the ensuing decay of mass transfer rate, we are able to reproduce, in a
self-sustained manner, the transition between the optical high/X-ray off and
optical low/X-ray on states of RX J0513.9-6951. Thus RX J0513.9-6951 is the
first example of the accretion wind evolution, which is a key evolutionary
process in a recently developed evolutionary path to Type Ia supernovae.

(in absolute value) in the Clausius' virial of the inner component B, when it
assumes a special configuration characterized by a value of its semi-major axis
we have named ""tidal radius"". The physical meaning, connected with its
appearance, is to introduce a scale length on the gravity field of the inner
subsystem, which is induced from the outer one. Its relevance in the galaxy
dynamics has been stressed by demonstrating that some of the main features of
the Fundamental Plane may follow as consequence of its existence. More physical
insight into the dynamics of a two component system may be got by looking at
the location of this scale length inside the plots of the potential energies of
each subsystem and of the whole system and by also taking into account the
trend of the anti-symmetric residual-energy, that is the difference between the
tidal and the interaction-energy of each component. Some thermodynamical
arguments related to the inner component are also added to prove as special is
the ""tidal radius configuration"". Moreover the role of the divergency at the
center of the two subsystems in obtaining this scale length is considered. For
the sake of simplicity the analysis has been performed in the case of a frozen
external component even if this constraint does not appear to be too relevant

the CuO2-plane hole concentration from the Cu L2,3-edge XANES spectra are in
good agreement with those obtained from the coulometric redox analysis. The
CuO2-plane hole concentration is found to increase from 0.03 to 0.14
concomitantly with the increase in the BiO1+d/2-layer hole concentration from
0.00 to 0.13 as the Ca-substitution level, x, increases from 0 to 1. The
threshold CuO2-plane hole concentration for the appearance of superconductivity
is determined at 0.06, while the highest Tc is obtained at the hole
concentration of 0.12. In the O K-edge XANES spectrum, the increases in the
CuO2-plane and BiO1+d/2-layer hole concentrations with increasing x are seen as
enhancement in the relative intensities of the pre-edge peaks at ~528.3 and
\~530.5 eV, respectively.

There have been no other studies that have analyzed power law statistics on

which is officially monitored and made available to the public by the Ministry
of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport Government of Japan. This is the largest
database of Japan's land prices, and consists of approximately 30,000 points
for each year of a 6-year period (1995-2000). By analyzing the data on the
assessed value of land, we were able to determine the power law distributions
of the land prices and of the relative prices of the land. The data fits to a
very good degree the approximation of power law distributions. We also found
that the price fluctuations were amplified with the level of the price. These
results hold for the data for each of the 6 annual intervals. Our empirical
findings present the conditions that any empirically accurate theories of land
market must satisfy.

Recently this has been of interest as it affects the analysis of the so-called

measurement of $\sin^{2} \theta_{W}$ and the currently accepted value. In this
paper we re-examine strange - anti-strange asymmetry using the meson cloud
model. We calculate contributions to the strange sea arising from fluctuations
in the proton wavefunction to states containing either Lambda or Sigma hyperons
together with either Kaons or pseudovector $K^{*}$ mesons. We find that we
should not ignore fluctuations involving $K^{*}$ mesons in this picture. The
strange sea asymmetry is found to be small, and is unlikely to affect the

57-Fe and 97-Mo targets. The level density curves reveal step structures above
the pairing gap due to the breaking of nucleon Cooper pairs. The location of
the step structures in energy and their shapes arise from the interplay between
single-particle energies and seniority-conserving and seniority-non-conserving
interactions.

instability. Using the optical radiation pressure of a cw laser to bend a very
soft near-critical liquid-liquid interface, we show that it becomes unstable
for sufficiently large beam power P, leading to the formation of a stationary
beam-centered liquid micro-jet. We explore the behavior of the instability
onset by tuning the interface softness with temperature and varying the size of
the exciting beam. The instability mechanism is experimentally demonstrated. It
simply relies on total reflection of light at the deformed interface whose
condition provides the universal scaling relation for the onset Ps of the
instability.

(superradiance) from an ultrathin film comprised of three-level atoms with
$V$-configuration of the operating transitions. As the thickness of the system
is small compared to the emission wavelength inside the film, the local-field
correction to the averaged Maxwell field is relevant. We show that the
interplay between the low-frequency quantum coherence within the subspace of
the upper doublet states and the local-field correction may drastically affect
the branching ratio of the operating transitions. This effect may be used for
controlling the emission process by varying the doublet splitting and the
amount of low-frequency coherence.

large scale structure (LSS) and the cosmic microwave background radiation

$N_{eff}$ in a general Cosmology. We find that $N_{eff}=4.31$ with a 95 per

95 per cent C.L. The curvature we derive is still consistent with flat, but
assuming a flat Universe from the beginning implies a bias toward lower
$N_{eff}$, as well as artificially smaller error bars. Adding the Supernovae
constraint doesn't improve the result. We analyze and discuss the degeneracies
with other parameters, and point out that probes of the matter power spectrum
on smaller scales, accurate independent $\sigma_8$ measurements, together with
better independent measurement of $H_0$ would help in breaking the

set analysed in this article covers a longer period and is more complete than

determining the false dismissal probability for a time coincidence search and
it optimizes the search with respect to a target amplitude and direction of the

used for drawing the results. The observations of this IGEC search are
consistent with no detection of gravitational wave burst events. A new
conservative upper limit has been set on the rate of gravitational wave bursts

without a filter for the Galactic Center direction. This study confirms that
the false alarm rate of the observation can be negligible when at least three

be expected to resemble the blue luminous knots found in tidal tails, but also

selected from the catalog of extended objects in fields around 15 strongly

similar redshifts of the central interacting galaxies, and photometric
completeness of the extended objects in V and R. The number density of these
TDG candidates was compared with expected background galaxy densities. Within
the statistical errors, background galaxies account for most, if not all of the

inner-shell transitions from O III to O VI ions, and the Unresolved Transition
Array of M-shell iron. The warm absorber found from this X-ray observation
spans three orders of magnitude in ionization parameter. We detect O III, which
is as lowly ionized as the warm absorber detected in the UV band, to Fe XXIV.
For O VI the column density determined from our X-ray data is an order of
magnitude larger than the column density measured in previous UV observations.
We conclude that there is substantially more low ionized material than
previously deduced from UV observations. However, only a few percent of the
warm absorber detected in the X-rays is lowly ionized. A 99.9 % significant
increase in the derived absorbing column density with higher ionization states
is observed. The outflow velocities determined from the X-ray absorption lines
are consistent with those deduced from the UV lines, evidence, together with
the detection of O VI, that the X-ray and UV warm absorber are different
manifestations of the same phenomenon. From a simple mass conservation
argument, we indicate that our data set is consistent with an outflow with
small opening angle formed due to instabilities in the accretion disk. Possible
due to uncertainties in the radiative transport mechanism, an apparent deviant
iron to oxygen abundance is detected. No strong relativistically broadened

factor of 2-3, and the corresponding under-abundance of S0 galaxies, relative
to the nearby clusters. This morphological evolution can be explained by tidal
interactions with neighboring galaxies and with the hierarchically growing
cluster halo. The efficiency of tidal interactions depends on the size and
structure of the cluster, as well as on the epoch of its formation. I simulate
the formation and evolution of Virgo-type clusters in three cosmologies: a
critical density model Omega_0=1, an open model Omega_0=0.4, and a flat model
Omega_0=0.4 with a cosmological constant. The orbits of identified halos are
traced with a high temporal resolution (~10^7 yr). Halos with low relative
velocities merge only shortly after entering the cluster; after virialization
mergers are suppressed. The dynamical evolution of galaxies is determined by
the tidal field along their trajectories. The maxima of the tidal force do not
always correspond to closest approach to the cluster center. They are produced
to a large extent by the local density structures, such as the massive galaxies
and the unvirialized remnants of infalling groups of galaxies. Collisions of
galaxies are intensified by the substructure, with about 10 encounters within
10 kpc per galaxy in the Hubble time. These very close encounters add an
important amount (10-50%) of the total heating rate. The integrated effect of
tidal interactions is insufficient to transform a spiral galaxy into an
elliptical, but can produce an S0 galaxy. Overall, tidal heating is stronger in

evolution. In order to quantify the amount of evolution, I run self-consistent
N-body simulations of disk galaxies for a variety of models in the
hierarchically forming clusters. The tidal field along the galactic orbits is
extracted from the simulations of cluster formation in the Omega_0=1;
Omega_0=0.4; and Omega_0=0.4, Omega_Lambda=0.6 cosmological scenarios. For
large spiral galaxies with the rotation speed of 250 km/s, tidal interactions
truncate massive dark matter halos at 30 +- 6 kpc, and thicken stellar disks by
a factor 2 to 3, increasing Toomre's parameter to Q > 2 and halting star
formation. Low density galaxies, such as the dwarf spheroidals with the
circular velocity of 20 km/s and the extended low surface brightness galaxies
with the scale length of 10-15 kpc, are completely disrupted by tidal shocks.
Their debris contribute to the diffuse intracluster light. The tidal effects
are significant not only in the core but throughout the cluster and can be
parametrized by the critical tidal density. The tidally-induced evolution
results in the transformation of the infalling spirals into S0 galaxies and in
the depletion of the LSB population. In the low Omega_0 cosmological models,
clusters form earlier and produce stronger evolution of galaxies.

cross-correlation of the CV spectrum with that of a K or M dwarf template, to
produce a radial velocity curve. Although this method has demonstrated its
power, it has its limits in the case of noisy spectra, such as are found when
the secondary is faint. A method of co-adding spectra, called skew mapping, has
been proposed in the past. Gradually, examples of its application are being
published. Nonetheless, so far no journal article has described the technique
in detail. To answer this need, this paper explores in detail the capabilities
of skew mapping when determining the amplitude of the radial velocity for faint
secondaries. It demonstrates the method's power over techniques that are more
conventional, when the signal-to-noise (s/n) ratio is poor. The paper suggests
an approach to assessing the quality of results. This leads in the case of the
investigated objects to a first tier of results, where we find K2=127+-23 km/s
for SY Cnc, K2=144+-18 km/s for RW Sex, and K2=262+-14 km/s for UX UMa. These
we believe to be the first direct determinations of K2 for these objects.
Furthermore, we also obtain K2=263+-30 km/s for RW Tri, close to a skew mapping
result obtained elsewhere. In the first three cases, we use these results to
derive the mass of the white dwarf companion. A second tier of results includes
UU Aqr, EX Hya, and LX Ser, for which we propose more tentative values of K2.
Clear failures of the method are also discussed (EF Eri, VV Pup, SW Sex).

will also increase. The angle scale at which the events have strong correlation
with each other corresponds to deflection angle of UHECR in propagating in the

investigate the relation between the number of events clustered at a direction

that the C2 triplet events observed by the AGASA may originate from the source

for their source. If data accumulate, the UHECR sources within $\sim 100$ Mpc
can be identified from observed event clusterings significantly. This will
provide some kinds of information about poorly known parameters which influence
the propagation of UHECRs, such as extragalactic and galactic magnetic field,
chemical composition of observed cosmic rays. Also, we will reveal their origin
with our method to identify the sources of UHECR. Finally, we predict the
arrival distribution of UHECRs above $10^{20}$ eV, which is expected to be
observed if the current HiRes spectrum is correct, and discuss their

long-term trend shown by the optical light curves seems to vary with a
characteristic time scale of about 3.3 years, while a longer period of 5.5-6
years seems to characterize the radio long-term variations. In general, optical
colour indices are only weakly correlated with brightness. The radio flux
behaviour at different frequencies is similar, but the flux variation amplitude
decreases with increasing wavelength. The radio spectral index varies with
brightness (harder when brighter), but the radio fluxes seem to be the sum of
two different-spectrum contributions: a steady base level and a harder-spectrum
variable component. Once the base level is removed, the radio variations appear
as essentially achromatic, similarly to the optical behaviour. Flux variations
at the higher radio frequencies lead the lower-frequency ones with week-month
time scales. The behaviour of the optical and radio light curves is quite
different, the broad radio outbursts not corresponding in time to the faster
optical ones and the cross-correlation analysis indicating only weak
correlation with long time lags. However, minor radio flux enhancements
simultaneous with the major optical flares can be recognized, which may imply
that the mechanism producing the strong flux increases in the optical band also
marginally affects the radio one.

which, emitted by material in the inner disc at resonance with the bar, can be
absorbed by resonant material in the outer disc, or in the halo. The amount of
angular momentum that can be emitted/absorbed at a given resonance depends on
the distribution function of the emitting/absorbing material. It thus depends
not only on the amount of material on resonant orbits, but also on the velocity
dispersion of that material. As it loses angular momentum, the bar becomes
stronger and it also rotates slower. Thus the strength of the bar and the
decrease of its pattern speed with time are set by the amount of angular
momentum exchanged within the galaxy, which, in turn, is regulated by the mass
distribution and the velocity dispersion of the material in the disc and
spheroidal components. Correlations between the pattern speed of the bar, its
strength and the angular momentum absorbed by the spheroid (halo plus bulge)
argue strongly that it is the amount of angular momentum exchanged that
determines the strength and the slowdown rate of the bar. The decrease of the
bar pattern speed with time should not be used to set constraints on the
halo-to-disc mass ratio, since it depends also on the velocity dispersion of
the halo and disc material.

spin-dependent interface resistance, resulting from an interfacial tunneling
region. The spin-dependent interface resistance is crucial for achieving spin
injection or spin polarization sensitivity in these configurations. We find
that the depletion region resulting from Schottky barrier formation at a
metal/semiconductor interface is detrimental to both spin injection and spin
detection. However, the depletion region can be tailored using a doping density
profile to minimize these deleterious effects. For example, a heavily doped
region near the interface, such as a delta-doped layer, can be used to form a
sharp potential profile through which electrons tunnel to reduce the effective
Schottky energy barrier that determines the magnitude of the depletion region.

non-Lorentzian. Its shape depends on the relation between the correlation
length r_c of the disorder potential and the typical amplitude delta_f of

Josephson junctions to two macroscopic superconducting electrodes is studied.
We focus on the effects of ohmic dissipation caused by resistive shunts and
superconducting-normal charge relaxation within the grain. As the temperature
is lowered, the behavior crosses over from uncoupled Josephson junctions,
similar to situations analyzed previously, to strongly interacting junctions.
The crossover temperature is related to the energy-level spacing of the grain
and is of the order of the inverse escape time from the grain. In the limit of
zero temperature, the two-junction system exhibits five distinct quantum
phases, including a novel superconducting state with localized Cooper pairs on
the grain but phase coherence between the leads due to Cooper pair cotunneling
processes. In contrast to a single junction, the transition from the fully
superconducting to fully normal phases is found to be controlled by an
intermediate coupling fixed point whose critical exponents vary continuously as
the resistances are changed. The model is analyzed via two component
sine-Gordon models and related Coulomb gases that provide effective low
temperature descriptions in both the weak and the strong Josephson coupling
limits. The complicated phase diagram is consistent with symmetries of the two
component sine-Gordon models, which include weak to strong coupling duality and
permutation triality. Experimental consequences of the results and potential
implications for superconductor to normal transitions in thin wires and films

connected to the aperture, or induces a voltage signal corresponding to carrier
extraction from the lead. Different geometries display the effect, and this
work discusses one experimental geometry in detail. Theoretically, the solution
of the Boltzmann equation, including an electron-electron collision integral,
shows that the potential induced by injected electrons becomes positive in the
regions nearby the main stream of injected electrons. Thus, the repulsive
Coulomb interaction leads to an attractive, pumping force in the Fermi liquid.

the form of a plate with dimensions $b\gg a>c$ in a microwave magnetic field
${\bf H_{\omega}}\perp ab$. To obtain the c-axis complex conductivity from
measurements at ${\bf H_{\omega}}\parallel ab$ we propose a procedure which
takes account of sample size effects. With the aid of the technique involved
temperature dependences of all impedance and conductivity tensors components of
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.95}$ single crystal, grown in BaZrO$_3$ crucible, are
determined at a frequency of $f=9.4$ GHz in its normal and superconducting
states. All of them proved to be linear at $T<T_c/2$, and their extrapolation
to zero temperature gives the values of residual surface resistance
$R_{ab}(0)\approx 40$ $\mu\Omega$ and $R_c(0)\approx 0.8$ m$\Omega$ and
magnetic field penetration depth $\lambda_{ab}(0)\approx 150$ nm and
$\lambda_c(0)\approx 1.55$ $\mu$m.

mechanism that causes these effects is explained by the headways of the cars
which organize in an alternating structure with a short headway following a
long one, thereby producing a strong anti-correlation in the gaps or in the
headways of subsequent cars. For the investigated model the corresponding time
headway distributions display the short headways observed in reality. Even

source of energy density perturbations leading to structure formation in
cosmology. The cosmological evolution of a coherently oscillating condensate of
right-handed sneutrinos is studied for the case where reheating after inflation
is due to perturbative inflaton decays. For the case of Dirac neutrinos, it is
shown that some suppression of Planck scale-suppressed corrections to the
right-handed neutrino superpotential is necessary. cH^2 corrections to the
sneutrino mass squared term must also be suppressed during inflation (|c| <
0.1), in which case, depending on the magnitude of |c| during inflation, a
significantly blue (if c > 0) or red (if c < 0) perturbation spectrum is
possible. R-parity must also be broken in order to ensure that the Universe is
not overclosed by LSPs from the late decay (at temperatures 1-10 MeV) of the
right-handed sneutrino condensate. The resulting expansion rate during
inflation can be significantly smaller than in conventional supersymmetric
inflation models (as low as 10^6 GeV is possible). For the case of Majorana
neutrinos, a more severe suppression of Planck-suppressed superpotential
corrections is required. In addition, the Majorana sneutrino condensate is
likely to be thermalised before it can dominate the energy density, which would
exclude the Majorana right-handed sneutrino as a curvaton.

Fermi-Dirac statistics, respectively. In the hadronization process the effects
of the former kind are the most important ones, since mesons are the most
common products in high-energy collisions. In the phenomenological Lund Model
the BE effect is approximated by a semiclassical momentum dependent correlation
function, which effectively acts as an attractive force between two mesons.
However, the Lund Model does also provide a space-time picture of the
hadronization process. Based on this, we have developed a simple extension of
the current LUBOEI algorithm that makes use of the production vertex distance
between two mesons.
  Comparisons between the old model and the new one is made for pions according
to exponential and Gaussian parameterizations of the BE correlation function.
Qualitatively we note a relative suppression of the BE effects in multi-jet
events, and especially for pairs of low momenta, with the new algorithm. This
trend is in agreement with preliminary experimental data.

having boundaries respect only a subgroup of the bulk symmetry. If the boundary
symmetry is the maximal subgroup allowed by the boundary conditions imposed on
the fields, then the symmetry can be consistently gauged; otherwise gauging
leads to an inconsistent theory. In a warped fifth dimension, an explicit
breaking of all bulk supersymmetries by the boundaries is found to be
inconsistent with gauging; unlike the case of flat 5D, complete supersymmetry
breaking by boundary conditions is not consistent with supergravity. Despite
this result, the low energy effective theory resulting from boundary
supersymmetry breaking becomes consistent in the limit where gravity decouples,
and such models are explored in the hope that some way of successfully
incorporating gravity can be found. A warped constrained standard model leads
to a theory with one Higgs boson with mass expected close to the experimental
limit. A unified theory in a warped fifth dimension is studied with boundary
breaking of both SU(5) gauge symmetry and supersymmetry. The usual
supersymmetric prediction for gauge coupling unification holds even though the
TeV spectrum is quite unlike the MSSM. Such a theory may unify matter and Higgs
in the same SU(5) hypermultiplet.

logarithmic, in \chi(X), if the conjectured surjectivity of the period map is
correct. Such surjectivity is targeted by the current work in gauge theory. The
surjectivity allows one to insert suitable lattices with metric properties
prescribed in advance, into the second de Rham cohomology group of X, as its
integer lattice. The idea is to adapt the well-known Lorentzian construction of
the Leech lattice, by replacing the Leech lattice by the Conway-Thompson
unimodular lattices which define asymptotically dense packings. The final step

Using this ranking, we generate the most promising subproblems first, by
exploring a search tree using a limited discrepancy strategy. Then the
subproblems are being solved using a constraint programming solver. To
strengthen the semidefinite relaxation, we propose to infer additional
constraints from the discrepancy structure. Computational results show that the

$\pi\pi$-rescattering effects are however still necessary to close a remaining
20%-gap to the empirical scalar spectral function. The isovector electric and
magnetic spectral functions Im $G_{E,M}^V(t)$ get additionally enhanced near

locally is studied using several variants of a kinetic rate model based on the
orientation-dependent number density of filaments. The model emphasizes the
effects of branching and capping on the density of free filament ends. The
variants differ in their treatment of side vs. end branching and
dimensionality, and assume that new branches are generated by existing branches
(autocatalytic behavior) or independently of existing branches (nucleation
behavior). In autocatalytic models, the network growth velocity is rigorously
independent of the opposing force exerted by the obstacle, and the network
density is proportional to the force. The dependence of the growth velocity on
the branching and capping rates is evaluated by a numerical solution of the
rate equations. In side-branching models, the growth velocity drops gradually
to zero with decreasing branching rate, while in end-branching models the drop
is abrupt. As the capping rate goes to zero, it is found that the behavior of
the velocity is sensitive to the thickness of the branching region. Experiments
are proposed for using these results to shed light on the nature of the
branching process.

channels is an attempt to answer the question of what kind of restriction
should be put on a channel, if it is to act `locally' with respect to two
`locations', when these naturally correspond to a separation of the total
Hilbert space in an orthogonal sum of subspaces, rather than a tensor product
decomposition. It is shown that the set of SL channels decomposes into four
disjoint families of channels. Explicit expressions to generate all channels in
each family is presented. It is shown that one of these four families, the
local subspace preserving (LSP) channels, is precisely the intersection between
the set of subspace preserving channels and the SL channels. For a subclass of
the LSP channels, a special type of unitary representation using ancilla
systems is presented.

brief description of this concept consider a pair of `evolution machines', each
with the ability to evolve the internal state of a `particle' inserted into its
input. Each of these machines is characterized by a channel describing the
operation the internal state has experienced when the particle is returned at
the output. Suppose a particle is put in a superposition between the input of
the first and the second machine. Here it is shown that the total evolution
caused by a pair of such devices is not uniquely determined by the channels of
the two machines. Such `global' channels describing the machine pair are
examples of gluings of the two single machine channels. Under the limiting
assumption that all involved Hilbert spaces are finite-dimensional, an
expression which generates all subspace preserving gluings of a given pair of
CPMs, is derived. The nature of the non-uniqueness of gluings and its relation
to a proposed definition of subspace locality, is discussed.

with the direction of information loss $\Delta I$ displayed by the random
evolution of the given system. When the information loss tends to zero the
intrinsic time-arrow becomes uncertain. We propose the heuristic relationship
$1/[1+exp(-s\Delta I)]$ for the probability of the intrinsic time-arrow. The
main parts of the present work are trying to confirm this heuristic equation.
The probability of intrinsic time arrow is defined by Bayesian inference from
the observed random process. From irreversible thermodynamic systems, the
proposed heuristic probabilities follow via the Gallavotti-Cohen relations
between time-reversed random processes. In order to explore the underlying
microscopic mechanism, a trivial microscopic process is analyzed and an obvious
discrepancy is identified. It can be resolved by quantum theory. The
corresponding trivial quantum process will exactly confirm the proposed
heuristic time-arrow probability.

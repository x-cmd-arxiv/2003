galaxy and X-ray maps. We use a variant of the Tegmark & Efstathiou (1996)
technique that is completely blind, making no assumptions about the CMB power
spectrum, the foregrounds, WMAP detector noise or external templates. Compared
with the foreground-cleaned internal linear combination map produced by the
WMAP team, our map has the advantage of containing less non-CMB power (from
foregrounds and detector noise) outside the Galactic plane. The difference is
most important on the the angular scale of the first acoustic peak and below,
since our cleaned map is at the highest (13') rather than lowest (49') WMAP
resolution. We also produce a Wiener filtered CMB map, representing our best
guess as to what the CMB sky actually looks like, as well as CMB-free maps at
the five WMAP frequencies useful for foreground studies.
  We argue that our CMB map is clean enough that the lowest multipoles can be
measured without any galaxy cut, and obtain a quadrupole value that is slightly
less low than that from the cut-sky WMAP team analysis. This can be understood
from a map of the CMB quadrupole, which shows much of its power falling within
the Galaxy cut region, seemingly coincidentally. Intriguingly, both the
quadrupole and the octopole are seen to have power suppressed along a
particular spatial axis, which lines up between the two, roughly towards (l,b)

change of dark energy equation of state $w_X$. Comparing these predictions
against available data we discuss to what extent the problems of galaxy biasing
can be modelled. This will be key in constraining the dark energy equation of
state with future galaxy surveys. We use a compilation of various surveys to
study the number density and amplitude of galaxy clustering from observations
of the local universe at $z \sim 0$ to that of the Lyman break galaxies and
Ly-$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 4.9$. We find that there is a degeneracy
between the dark energy equation of state and the way galaxies populate dark
matter haloes; objects are more biased in models with more negative values of
dark energy equation of state $w_X$.
  We conclude that, while future all sky CMB observations will determine
cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision, and cross correlation of
weak lensing experiments and galaxy surveys will provide a cleaner and accurate
picture of bias associated with collapsed objects, the rate of growth of large
scale structure in such surveys can potentially constrain the equation of state
of dark energy and the potential of the scalar field associated with
quintessence. In particular, we show that the abundance and spatial
distribution of galaxy clusters at intermediate redshifts strongly depend on
the dark energy equation of state. When accurate measurement of galaxy
clustering at high-redshit becomes possible, it will provide constraints on
dark energy that are independent and complementary to type Ia supernova

arcsec seeing) -- taken with NIRSPEC on the Keck II telescope -- show a smooth
rotation pattern across the nucleus in the Paschen alpha and H_2 emission lines

Higher spatial resolution observations of the [OIII]5007 emission line -- taken

pattern of the gas in the direction perpendicular to the radio axis, and
provide evidence for steep velocity gradients within a radius of 0.1 arcsec of
the core. The circular velocities measured from both the Keck and HST data lead
to an estimate of the mass of the supermassive black hole of 2.5+/-0.7x10^9
solar masses. For the host galaxy properties of Cygnus A, this mass is
consistent with the global correlations between black hole mass and host galaxy
properties deduced for non-active galaxies. Therefore, despite the extreme
power of its radio source and the quasar-like luminosity of its AGN, the black
hole in Cygnus A is not unusually massive considering theluminosity of its host
galaxy. Indeed, the estimated mass of the black hole in Cygnus A is similar to
that inferred for the supermassive black hole in the FRI radio galaxy M87,
despite the fact that the AGN and radio jets of Cygnus A are 2 -- 3 orders of

previous calculations of the universal diffuse neutrino flux produced by all

within the Local Bubble has been observed, no resonance line emission was
detected during our 230 ksec Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer observation
toward a ``shadowing'' filament in the southern Galactic hemisphere. As a
result, tight 2 sigma upper limits are set on the intensities in the 1032 and
1038 Angstrom emission lines: 500 and 530 photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1},
respectively. These values place strict constraints on models and simulations.
They suggest that the O VI-bearing plasma and the X-ray emissive plasma reside
in distinct regions of the Local Bubble and are not mixed in a single plasma,
whether in equilibrium with T ~ 10^6 K or highly overionized with T ~ 4 to 6 x
10^4 K. If the line of sight intersects multiple cool clouds within the Local
Bubble, then the results also suggest that hot/cool transition zones differ
from those in current simulations. With these intensity upper limits, we
establish limits on the electron density, thermal pressure, pathlength, and
cooling timescale of the O VI-bearing plasma in the Local Bubble. Furthermore,
the intensity of O VI resonance line doublet photons originating in the
Galactic thick disk and halo is determined (3500 to 4300 photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}
sr^{-1}), and the electron density, thermal pressure, pathlength, and cooling
timescale of its O VI-bearing plasma are calculated. The pressure in the
Galactic halo's O VI-bearing plasma (3100 to 3800 K cm^{-3}) agrees with model
predictions for the total pressure in the thick disk/lower halo. We also report

the X-ray and optical emissions were only correlated when Sco X-1 was brighter
than about B = 12.6. Models had suggested that the optical emission from this
source arose from X-rays reprocessed in an accretion disk surrounding the
central neutron star. It was therefore difficult to explain why the optical and
X-ray fluxes were not more closely correlated. In 1994 and 1995, two new
simultaneous optical and X-ray campaigns on Sco X-1 were conducted with the

the 1 m Yale telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. Using these

qualitative picture of how the X-ray and optical emissions from Sco X-1 are
related. Differences in the B-magnitude histograms are caused by variations in
the mass accretion rate and the relatively short time period usually covered by
optical investigations. The tilted Gamma pattern seen in plots of the
simultaneous X-ray and optical emission from Sco X-1 arises from (1) the nearly
linear relation between the optical B magnitude and the mass accretion rate in
the range 13.3 > B > 12.3 and an asymptotic behaviour in the B magnitude
outside this range, and (2) a double-valued relation between the X-ray emission

disk rotation is close to Keplerian (v varies as 1/sqrt(r)), the maximum
detected rotation speed is 260 km/s, and the inferred central mass is 1.7+/-0.3

3C 351 obtained with STIS. 3C 351 lies behind the low-latitude edge of
high-velocity cloud Complex C, and the new spectrum provides accurate
measurements of O I, Si II, Al II, Fe II, and Si III absorption lines at the
velocity of the HVC. We use collisional and photoionization models to derive
ionization corrections; in both models we find that the overall metallicity Z =
0.1 - 0.3 Z_{solar} in Complex C, but nitrogen must be underabundant. The iron
abundance indicates that Complex C contains very little dust. The absorbing gas
probably is not gravitationally confined. The gas could be pressure-confined by
an external medium, but alternatively we may be viewing the leading edge of the
HVC, which is ablating and dissipating as it plunges into the Milky Way. O VI
column densities observed with FUSE toward nine QSOs/AGNs behind Complex C
support this conclusion: N(O VI) is highest near 3C 351, and the O VI/H I ratio
increases substantially with decreasing latitude, suggesting that the
lower-latitude portion of the cloud is interacting more vigorously with the
Galaxy. The other sight lines through Complex C show some dispersion in
metallicity, but with the current uncertainties, the measurements are
consistent with a constant metallicity throughout the HVC. However, all of the
Complex C sight lines require significant nitrogen underabundances. Finally, we
compare the 3C 351 sight line to the sight line to the nearby QSO H1821+643 to
search for evidence of outflowing Galactic fountain gas that could be mixing
with Complex C. We find that the intermediate-velocity gas detected toward 3C
351 and H1821+643 has a higher metallicity and may well be a fountain/chimney
outflow from the Perseus spiral arm.

very luminous ULXs, which may contain intermediate mass black holes; however,
the complex diffuse emission of the Antennae demands this finding be regarded

new technique for determining the degree of reddening and extinction due to

method compares the color-magnitude plane distributions of galaxies from
cluster and control regions on the sky, where control regions are assumed to be
unaffected by dust. The method is statistical in nature; it can distinguish
between uniformly, non-uniformly, and clumpily distributed dust, and can
determine the amount of reddening and obscuration without a priori assuming an
$A_R/E(B_{J}-R)$ ratio. We apply the method to nearby, $z \le 0.08$, medium
rich and poor APM galaxy clusters. We detect no dust in these on 1.3 Mpc scales
(we assume $h = 0.75$), and derive 99% confidence upper limits on extinction of
$A_{R} = 0.025 $ and reddening of $E(B_{J} - R) = 0.025 ($which corresponds to
$E(B - V) \approx 0.02)$. We test the method using clusters whose galaxies have
been artificially reddened and obscured by various amounts, and conclude that
it robustly recovers the input values for reddening, its distribution, and the
ratio of total-to-selective extinction. The method can be applied to any set of

outer stellar disk to the presence of a central bar, as in the Milky-Way. We
find that the bar's outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) causes significant
perturbations of the velocity moments. With increasing velocity dispersion, the
radius of these perturbations is shifted outwards, beyond the nominal position
of the OLR, but also the disk becomes less responsive. If we follow Dehnen
(2000) in assuming that the OLR occurs just inside the Solar circle and that
the Sun lags the bar major axis by ~20 degrees, we find (1) no significant
radial motion of the local standard of rest (LSR), (2) a vertex deviation of
\~10 degrees and (3) a lower ratio sigma_2/sigma_1 of the principal components
of the velocity- dispersion tensor than for an unperturbed disk. All of these
are actually consistent with the observations of the Solar-neighbourhood
kinematics. Thus it seems that at least the lowest-order deviations of the

a hidden broad line region (BLR), and are thus intrinsically broad line (type
1) AGN. Does this AGN unification applies for all type 2 AGN? Indirect
arguments suggest that some ""true"" type 2 AGN, i.e. AGN having no obscured BLR
do exist, but it is not clear why the BLR is missing in these AGN. Here we
point out a possible natural explanation. The observed radius-luminosity
relation for the BLR implies an increasing line width with decreasing
luminosity for a given black hole mass (Mbh). In addition, there appears to be
an upper limit to the observed width of broad emission lines in AGN of Delta
v_max~25,000 km/s, which may reflect a physical limit above which the BLR may
not be able to survive. Thus, at a low enough luminosity the BLR radius shrinks
below the Delta v_max radius, leaving no region where the BLR can exist,
although the AGN may remain otherwise `normal'. The implied minimum bolometric
luminosity required to sustain a BLR with Delta v<25,000 km/s is
L_min~10^{41.8}(Mbh}/10^8M_sun)^2. All AGN with L<L_min are expected to be
`true' type 2 AGN, i.e. narrow line AGN without a hidden BLR. Predictions for
the true nature of low luminosity AGN in two samples of nearby galaxies are
provided. These can be used to test the above L_min conjecture, and the
predictions of other models for the size and origin of the BLR.

L(Sun). We introduce a method of disentangling the total continuum spectrum
into its individual components of radiation for current models of symbiotic
binaries. Applying a standard ionization model we show that the configuration
of AR Pav differs significantly from that typical for symbiotic binaries during
their quiescent phases. The best fit of the observed SED is provided by
radiation of a simple blackbody accretion disk with L(AD)=1700(d/4.9 kpc)**2
L(Sun), which is embedded in an extended hot corona with Te=40000+/-5000K and
L(neb)=500 (d/4.9 kpc)**2 L(Sun). This basic configuration of the hot object
explains also the observed wavelength-dependent depth and width of the eclipse
profile. The standard thin disk model requires a high accretion rate dot M(acc)
> 2x1E-4M(Sun)/yr onto the central star with a radius R(acc) > 2R(Sun) to
balance the observed luminosity. Irrespectively to the disk model, the
accretion process limits R(acc) > 0.1R(Sun) for dot M(acc) > 1.7x1E-5 M(Sun)/yr
and M(acc)=0.75 - 1.0M(Sun), which precludes a white dwarf to be the accreting

stellar initial mass function (IMF), we derive the stellar mass function of
galaxies. The faint end slope slope for the stellar mass function is steeper
than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M/Ls characteristic of low-mass galaxies.
We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local Universe

disparate time and length scales. Here, a fluid described at the atomistic
level within an inner region P is coupled to an outer region C described by
continuum fluid dynamics. The matching of both descriptions of matter is made
across an overlapping region and, in general, consists of a two-way coupling
scheme (C->P and P->C) which conveys mass, momentum and energy fluxes. The
contribution of the hybrid scheme hereby presented is two-fold: first it treats
unsteady flows and, more importantly, it handles energy exchange between both C
and P regions. The implementation of the C->P coupling is tested here using
steady and unsteady flows with different rates of mass, momentum and energy
exchange. In particular, relaxing flows described by linear hydrodynamics
(transversal and longitudinal waves) are most enlightening as they comprise the
whole set of hydrodynamic modes. Applying the hybrid coupling scheme after the
onset of an initial perturbation, the cell-averaged Fourier components of the
flow variables in the P region (velocity, density, internal energy, temperature
and pressure) evolve in excellent agreement with the hydrodynamic trends. It is
also shown that the scheme preserves the correct rate of entropy production. We
discuss some general requirements on the coarse-grained length and time scales
arising from both the characteristic microscopic and hydrodynamic scales.

directly into a constraint in the $\rho$--$\eta$ plane. However, we may
complement $\phi_d$ with $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$ and the recently measured CP
asymmetries in $B_d\to\pi^+ \pi^-$ to determine the unitarity triangle, with
its angles $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$. To this end, we have also to control
penguin effects, which we do by means of the $B_d\to\pi^\mp K^\pm$ branching
ratio. Interestingly, the present data show a perfectly consistent picture not
only for the ``standard'' solution of $\phi_d\sim 47^\circ$, but also for
$\phi_d\sim 133^\circ$. In the latter case, the preferred region for the apex
of the unitarity triangle is in the second quadrant, allowing us to accommodate
conveniently $\gamma>90^\circ$, which is also favoured by other non-leptonic B
decays such as $B\to\pi K$. Moreover, also the prediction for
BR$(K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu})$ can be brought to better agreement with
experiment. Further strategies to explore this scenario with the help of
$B_{d,s}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decays are discussed as well.

significantly improve the bounds on the mixing angle obtained from the solar

probabilities in matter (vacuum) as is relevant for the solar (KamLAND)
experiments. We find that the presence of matter effects in the survival

SNO an edge over KamLAND, as far as $\theta_{12}$ sensitivity is concerned,
particularly near maximal mixing. Among solar neutrino experiments we identify
SNO as the most promising candidate for constraining $\theta_{12}$ and make a
projected sensitivity test for the mixing angle by reducing the error in the
neutral current measurement at SNO. Finally we argue that the most accurate
bounds on $\theta_{12}$ can be achieved in a reactor experiment, if the
corresponding baseline and energy can be tuned to a minimum in the survival
probability. We propose a new reactor experiment which can give the value of

nucleation of a locally charged spherical brane, so intersecting fluxbranes are
unstable to various decay modes. Each individual element of the intersection
can decay via the nucleation of a spherical brane, but uncharged spheres can
also be nucleated in the region of intersection. For special values of the
fluxes, however, intersecting fluxbranes are supersymmetric, and so are
expected to be stable. We explicitly consider the instanton describing the
decay modes of the two--element intersection (an F5-brane in the string theory
context), and show that in dimensions greater than four the action for the
decay mode of the supersymmetric intersection diverges. This observation allows
us to show that stable intersecting fluxbranes should also exist in type 0A
string theory.

horizon. The four-dimensional (4D) theory is first reduced to a tower of
two-dimensional (2D) gravities such that each 2D theory is induced by fields
with certain momentum $p$ along the horizon. We demonstrate that in the
vicinity of the horizon constituents of the 2D induced gravities are described
by conformal field theories (CFT) with specific central charges depending on
spin and non-minimal couplings and with specific correlation lengths depending
on the masses of fields and on the momentum $p$. This enables one to use CFT
methods to count partial entropies $s(p)$ in each 2D sector. The sum of partial
entropies correctly reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the 4D induced
gravity theory. Our results indicate that earlier attempts of the derivation of
the entropy of black holes based on a near-horizon CFT may have a microscopic
realization.

magnitudes of the physical system. This expression coincides with the principle
of action expressed for a tensorial action [2]. The scalar form of this
principle coincides, in its turn, with the traditional relativistic and quantum
expression, of the principle of action or principle of least action according
to other authors.

We use laser Doppler anemometry in order to determine the velocity of each
fluid inside a cylindrical tube. In the case of the Newtonian fluid, the
dissipative nature is observed and the response obeys the Zhou and Sheng
universality (PRB 39, 12027 (1989)). In the dynamic response of the Maxwellian
fluid an enhancement at the frequencies predicted by the corresponding theory
(PRE 58, 6323 (1998)) is observed.

Greene","Multichannel cold collisions between metastable Sr atoms","4 pages, Latex, Submitted",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.253201",,"physics.atom-ph",,"  We present a multichannel scattering calculation of elastic and inelastic
cold collisions between two low-field seeking, metastable ^{88}Sr [(5s5p)
^3P_2] atoms in the presence of an external magnetic field. The scattering
physics is governed by strong anisotropic long-range interactions, which lead
to pronounced coupling among the partial waves of relative motion. As a result,
nonadiabatic transitions are shown to trigger a high rate of inelastic losses.
At relatively high energies, T > 100 mkK, the total inelastic collision rate is
comparable with the elastic rate. However, at lower collisional energy, the
elastic rate decreases, and at T ~ 1mkK, it becomes substantially smaller than
the inelastic rate. Our study suggests that magnetic trapping and evaporative
cooling of ^{88}Sr [(5s5p) ^3P_2] atoms, as well as ^{40}Ca [(4s4p) ^3P_2], in
low-field seeking states will prove difficult to achieve experimentally.

is currently being detected in solar reactions (and possibly in other high

a particle is an unnecessary proposition in explaining the beta-decay reaction.
In addition, it became obvious that concepts such as ""flavor oscillations"" of
the solar neutrinos are superfluous. In this paper it is further demonstrated
that if certain key experiments of the past are reinterpreted in view of the
total energy equation H=mv^2, then the principle of the existence of different

time-asymmetric, causal boundary condition, and discuss the connection of
Feynman's $+i \epsilon$ prescription with the arrow of time of Quantum
Electrodynamics. A parallel of this arrow of time with that of Classical
Electrodynamics is made. We conclude that in general, the time evolution of a
closed quantum system has indeed an arrow of time built into the propagators.

when the the atom-cavity interaction departs from the strong coupling regime,
and considering imperfect detectors, we show that the scheme is robust against
experimental inefficiencies and yields probabilistic entanglement of very high

two sources to a common receiver. The radiation travels through free space in
the presence of noise. The information resides in a relationship between the
two beams. We inquire into whether itis possible, in principle, that the
locations of the transmitters can be concealed from a party who receives the
radiation and decodes the information. Direction finding entails making a set
of measurements on asignal and constructing an analytic continuation of the
time dependent fields from the results. The fact that this process is generally
different in quantum mechanics and in classical electrodynamics is the basis in
this investigation. We develop a model based upon encoding information into a
microscopic, transverse, non-local quantum image (whose dimensions are of the
order of a few wavelengths) and using a detector of a type recently proposed by
Strekalov et al. The optical system, which uses SPDC (Spontaneous Parametric
Down Conversion), functions like a Heisenberg microscope: the transverse
length, which encodes the signal information, is conjugate to the transverse
momentum of the light. In the model, reading the signal information spoils the
directional resolution of the detector, while determining the directions to the
sources spoils the information content. Each beam, when examined in isolation,
is random and indistinguishable from the background noise. We conclude that
quantum communications can, in principle, be made secure against
direction-finding, even from the party receiving the communication.

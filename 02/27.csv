warm absorber as seen in a FUSE observation one year previously. The 0.2-10 keV
spectral continuum is best fitted by a power-law plus two blackbody model. An
Fe K-alpha emission line is visible which consists of a single narrow component
and is well-modelled by a simple gaussian. Narrow absorption and emission lines
in the soft X-ray RGS spectrum demonstrate the existence of a multi-phase warm
absorber with a range in log xi of ~ 2 to ~ -2 where xi is in erg cm s^-1. The
warm absorber is blueshifted by several hundred km s^-1. The highest-ionisation
phase of the absorber is the best constrained and has an overall equivalent
Hydrogen column of order 10^20 cm^-2; we find that its ionisation parameter is
consistent with that of the warm emitter which generates the narrow emission
lines. We identify this high ionisation absorber with the low-velocity phase of
the UV absorber observed by FUSE.

doublet. The absorption arises in two distinct kinematic components at systemic
velocities of -569 km/s and -1898 km/s. Both components are very highly
ionized- no significant Ly beta absorption is present. The higher blueshift
component is not quite saturated, and it has a total OVI column density of
8e14/cm2. It covers more than 90% of the continuum and broad-line emission. The
lower blue shift component is heavily saturated and covers only 50% of the

this is less certain due to the high saturation. We set an upper limit of
<1.5e18/cm2 on the OVI column density of this component. Its line depth is
consistent with coverage of only the continuum, and thus this component may lie
interior to the broad emission-line gas. The component at -569 km/s has a
velocity comparable to the high-ionization X-ray absorption lines seen in the
XMM-Newton grating spectrum of NGC 7469, and photoionization models show that
the observed column densities of OVI and HI are compatible with their formation
in the same gas as that causing the X-ray absorption. The gas at -1898 km/s has
lower ionization and column density, and no significant X-ray absorption is
associated with it.

which has recently been observed by XMM-Newton for 200ksec. XMM-Newton will
provide good quality X-ray spectra for over 200 sources with fluxes around the
knee of the logN/logS, which are responsible for the bulk of the X-ray
background (XRB). The main aim of the Chandra observations is to provide
arcsecond, or better, positions, and hence reliable identifications, for the
XMM-Newton sources. The ACIS-I observations were arranged in a mosaic of four
30ksec pointings, covering almost all of the 15' radius XMM-Newton/ROSAT field.
We detect 214 Chandra sources above 5 sigma significance, to a limiting flux of
\~1.3e-15 erg/cm2/s (0.5-7 keV). Optical counterparts are derived from a Subaru
SuprimeCam image reaching to R~27. The very large majority of the Chandra
sources have an optical counterpart, with the distribution peaking at 23<R<24,
although 14 have no counterpart to R=27. The fraction of X-ray sources with no
identification brighter than R=27 is similar to that found in deeper Chandra
surveys. The majority of the identifications are with galaxies. As found in
other Chandra surveys, there is a very wide range of optical magnitude for
given X-ray flux, implying a range of emission mechanisms, and many sources
have high L_X/L_opt ratios, implying absorption at moderate redshift.
Comparison with the earlier ROSAT survey shows that the accuracy of the ROSAT
positions agrees very well with the predictions from simulations in McHardy et
al. (1998) and that the large majority of the identifications were correct
(abridged).

present. We perform a joint UV and X-ray analysis, using photoionization

that the X-ray absorption occurs at high velocities in the same general region

occurrence of gravitational collapse to a black hole from a critical mass core
of mass $M\agt 10M_\odot$, which clearly differs from the values of the
critical mass encountered in the study of stars ``catalyzed at the endpoint of
thermonuclear evolution"" (white dwarfs and neutron stars); (ii) the extremely
high efficiency of the spherical collapse to a black hole, where almost 99.99%
of the core mass collapses leaving negligible remnant; (iii) the necessity of
developing a fine tuning in the final phases of thermonuclear evolution of the
stars, both for the star collapsing to the black hole and the surrounding ones,
in order to explain the possible occurrence of the ""induced gravitational
collapse"". A new class of space missions to acquire information on such extreme

z~4.7-5.4 mostly taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The present
sample complements previous X-ray studies of z>4 quasars, in which the majority
of the objects are optically more luminous and at lower redshifts. All but two
of our quasars have been detected in the X-ray band, thus doubling the number
of z>4.8 X-ray detected quasars. The two non-detections are likely to be due to
a short exposure time and to the presence of intrinsic absorption. We confirm
and extend to the highest redshifts the presence of a correlation between
AB1450(1+z) magnitude and soft X-ray flux for z>4 quasars, and the presence of
a steeper optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distribution (parameterized by aox)
for high-luminosity, high-redshift quasars than for lower-luminosity,
lower-redshift quasars. The second effect is likely due to the known
anti-correlation between aox and rest-frame 2500 Angstrom luminosity, whose
significance is confirmed via partial correlation analysis. The joint ~2.5-36
keV rest-frame spectrum of the z>4.8 SDSS quasars observed thus far by Chandra
is well parameterized by a power-law with photon index Gamma=1.84+/-0.30; this
photon index is consistent with those of z~0-3 quasars and that obtained from
joint spectral fitting of z~4.1-4.5 optically luminous Palomar Digital Sky

astrometrically. First, they are relatively heavy, and for fixed planetary mass
the astrometric signal falls inversely as the stellar mass. Second, they are
relatively rare (and so tend to be more distant), and for fixed orbital
separation the astrometric signal falls inversely as the distance.
Nevertheless, because early-type stars are relatively more luminous, their
habitable zones are at larger semi-major axis. Since astrometric signal scales
directly as orbital size, this gives early-type stars a strong advantage, which
more than compensates for the other two factors. Using the Hipparcos catalog,
we show that early-type stars constitute the majority of viable targets for
astrometric searches for planets in the habitable zone. We contrast this
characteristic to transit searches, which are primarily sensitive to habitable
planets around late-type stars.

different reasons (e.g. spacecraft-ground transmissions) while performing a
full-sky survey with space-borne instrumentation. This is a particularly
important issue considering the current and future space missions (like Planck
from ESA and WMAP from NASA) operating from an orbit far from Earth with short
periods of visibility from ground stations. We consider, as a working case, the
Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) on-board the Planck satellite albeit the
approach developed here can be easily applied to any kind of experiment that
makes use of an observing (scanning) strategy which assumes repeated pointings
of the same region of the sky on different time scales. The issue is addressed
by means of a Monte Carlo approach. Our analysis clearly shows that, under
quite general conditions, it is better to cover the sky more times with a lower
fraction of TM retained than less times with a higher guaranteed TM fraction.
In the case of Planck, an extension of mission time to allow a third sky
coverage with 95% of the total TM guaranteed provides a significant reduction
of the probability to loose scientific information with respect to an increase
of the total guaranteed TM to 98% with the two nominal sky coverages.

return from SZ surveys. As a simple illustration of the information content of
the angular function, we examine its dependence on the parameter pair Om_m,
sigma_8 in flat cosmologies. We discuss sources of modeling uncertainty and

starburst/AGN galaxy NGC4945. The profile of the solid CO band reveals the
importance of thermal processing of the ice while the prominence of the XCN
band attests to the importance of energetic processing of the ice by FUV
radiation and/or energetic particles. In analogy to the processing of ices by
embedded protostars in our Galaxy, we attribute the processing of the ices in
the center of NGC4945 to ongoing massive star formation. Our M-band spectrum
also shows strong HI Pfund-beta and H2 0-0 S(9) line emission and gas phase CO
absorption lines. The HI, H2, PAH, gas phase CO and the ices seem to be
embedded in a rotating molecular disk which is undergoing vigorous star
formation. Recently, strong OCN- absorption has been detected in the spectrum
of the Galactic center star GC:IRS19. The most likely environment for the OCN-
absorption is the strongly UV-exposed GC molecular ring. The presence of
processed ice in the center of NGC4945 and our Galactic center leads us to
believe that processed ice may be a common characteristic of dense molecular
material in star forming galactic nuclei.

chapter of a recent book by the author, {\it Nanoscale Phase Separation and
Colossal Magnetoresistance. The Physics of Manganites and Related Compounds},
Springer-Verlag, Berlin, November 2002. The main new result of recent manganite
investigations is the discovery of tendencies toward inhomogeneous states, both
in experiments and in simulations of models. The colossal magnetoresistance
effect appears to be closely linked to these mixed-phase tendencies, although
considerably more work is needed to fully confirm these ideas. The paper also
includes information on cuprates, diluted magnetic semiconductors, relaxor
ferroelectrics, cobaltites, and organic and heavy fermion superconductors.
These materials potentially share some common phenomenology with the
manganites, such as a temperature scale $T^*$ above the ordering temperature
where anomalous behavior starts. Many of these materials also present
low-temperature phase competition. The possibility of colossal-like effects in
compounds that do not involve ferromagnets is briefly discussed. Overall, it is
concluded that inhomogeneous ``clustered'' states should be considered a new
paradigm in condensed matter physics, since their presence appears to be far
more common than previously anticipated.

bulk of the paper is devoted to thorough investigations of Ising spin glasses

paradigm for glassy dynamics. Simple scaling expressions with universal
exponents for (a) barrier energies, (b) energy minima, and (c) the Hamming

residence time inside valleys entered at age $t_w$ is investigated, along with
the distribution of time at which the global minimum inside a valley is hit.

with compactified large extra dimensions a black hole might evolve into a

holes and therefore their relics might be produced at the LHC in the case of
extra-dimensional topologies. In this energy regime, Hawking's evaporation
scenario is modified due to energy conservation and quantum effects. We
reanalyse the evaporation of small black holes including the quantisation of
the emitted radiation due to the finite surface of the black hole. It is found
that observable stable black hole relics with masses $\sim 1-3 M_f$ would form
which could be identified by a delayed single jet with a corresponding hard
momentum kick to the relic and by ionisation, e.g. in a TPC.

can expect that the above constraints may be removed if thermal inflation is

explanation of the observed high-energy ``Reggeization'' of strong interaction

perturbative calculations inadequate. However, since then, no convincing
derivation of the link between gauge field theory at strong coupling and string
theory has come out. This 35-years-old puzzle is thus still unsolved. We
discuss how modern tools like the AdS/CFT correspondence give a new insight on
the problem by applying it to two-body elastic and inelastic scattering
amplitudes. We obtain a geometrical interpretation of Reggeization and its
relation with confinement in gauge theory.

on the gradual extension of the ""embryo"" of an analytic function of several

analyticity is the DA and which satisfies an iterative functional equation. The
equation permits to establish an ""embryo"" of the Lyapunov function and a first

considered as a calculus of contextual probabilities. In our approach it is
forbidden to consider abstract context independent probabilities: ``first
context and then probability.'' We start with the conventional formula of total
probability for contextual (conditional) probabilities and then we rewrite it
by eliminating combinations of incompatible contexts from consideration. In
this way we obtain interference of probabilities without to appeal to the
Hilbert space formalism or wave mechanics. However, we did not just reconstruct
the probabilistic formalism of conventional quantum mechanics. Our contextual
probabilistic model is essentially more general and, besides the projection to
the complex Hilbert space, it has other projections. The most important new
prediction is the possibility (at least theoretical) of appearance of
hyperbolic interference.

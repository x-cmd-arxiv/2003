stars and the observed position of the first peak in the angular power spectrum
of the CMB. We find w<-0.8 at the 68% confidence level. If we further consider
that w > -1, this finding suggests that within our uncertainties, dark energy
is indistinguishable from a classical vacuum energy term.
  We detect a correlation between the ages of the oldest galaxies and their
redshift. This opens up the possibility of measuring w(z) by computing the
relative ages of the oldest galaxies in the universe as a function of redshift,
dz/dt. We show that this is a realistic possibility by computing dz/dt at z~0
from SDSS galaxies and obtain an independent estimate for the Hubble constant,
H_0 = 69 \pm 12 km s-1 Mpc-1. The small number of galaxies considered at z>0.2
does not yield, currently, a precise determination of w(z), but shows that the
age--redshift relation is consistent with a Standard LCDM universe with $w=-1$.

Ly-alpha forest constraints with those from the cosmic microwave background
(CMB). This combination is particularly powerful as a probe of the primordial
shape of the power spectrum. Converting between the Ly-alpha forest
observations and the linear mass power spectrum requires a careful treatment of
nuisance parameters and modeling with cosmological simulations. We point out
several issues which lead to an expansion of the errors, the two most important
being the range of cosmological parameters explored in simulations and the
treatment of the mean transmitted flux constraints. We employ a likelihood
calculator for the current Ly-alpha data set based on an extensive
6-dimensional grid of simulations. We show that the current uncertainties in
the mean transmission and the flux power spectrum define a degeneracy line in
the amplitude-slope plane. The CMB degeneracy due to the primordial power
spectrum shape follows a similar relation in this plane. This weakens the
statistical significance of the primordial power spectrum shape constraints
based on combined CMB+Ly-alpha forest analysis. Using the current data the
simplest n=1 scale invariant model with dn/dln k=0 and no tensors has a Delta
chi^2=4 compared to the best fitting model in which these 3 parameters are
free. Current data therefore do not require relaxing these parameters to
improve the fit.

selected AGN from the HEAO-1 A2 sample. We compare the far-IR to X-ray spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) of this sample with various radio and optically
selected AGN samples. The hard-X-ray selected sample shows a wider range of
optical/UV shapes extending to redder near-IR colors. The bluer objects are
Seyfert 1s, while the redder AGN are mostly intermediate or type 2 Seyferts.
This is consistent with a modified unification model in which the amount of
obscuring material increases with viewing angle and may be clumpy. Such a
scenario, already suggested by differing optical/near-IR spectroscopic and
X-ray AGN classifications, allows for different amounts of obscuration of the
continuum emission in different wavebands and of the broad emission line region
which results in a mixture of behaviors for AGN with similar optical emission
line classifications. The resulting limits on the column density of obscuring
material through which we are viewing the redder AGN are 100 times lower than
for the standard optically thick torus models. The resulting decrease in
optical depth of the obscuring material allows the AGN to heat more dust at
larger radial distances. We show that an AGN-heated, flared, dusty disk with
mass 10^9 solar and size of few hundred pc is able to generate optical-far-IR
SEDs which reproduce the wide range of SEDs present in our sample with no need
for an additional starburst component to generate the long-wavelength, cooler
part of the IR continuum.

the cooling pattern of the ICM. All of our heating schemes which correctly
reproduce the X-ray scaling properties of clusters and groups do not succeed in
reducing the fraction of collapsed gas below a level of 20 (30) per cent at the
cluster (group) scale. Finally, gas compression in cooling cluster regions
causes an increase of the temperature and a steepening of the temperature
profiles, independent of the presence of non-gravitational heating processes.
This is inconsistent with recent observational evidence for a decrease of gas
temperature towards the center of relaxed clusters. Provided these
discrepancies persist even for a more refined modeling of energy feedback, they
may indicate that some basic physical process is still missing in

ROSAT observations of M17 detected diffuse X-ray emission peaking at the

suggests that no supernovae have yet occurred in M17; therefore, it provides a
rare opportunity to study hot gas energized solely by shocked stellar winds in

that bubble models with heat conduction overpredict the X-ray luminosity by two
orders of magnitude; the strong magnetic fields in M17, as measured from HI
Zeeman observations, have most likely inhibited heat conduction and associated
mass evaporation. Bubble models without heat conduction can explain the X-ray

factors. Moreover, the individual components where H2 is detected have
depletion factors systematically larger than other components in the profiles.
In two different systems, one of the H2-detected components even has

in more extended diffuse emission (D>=3'). The NS structure is somewhat clumpy,
more sharply bounded on the W side and prominent only in the soft band
(energies below ~2 keV). Its observational properties are best explained as a
shock produced by a high velocity encounter between NGC7318b, a ``new

high speed intruder suggest that a bow shock is propagating into a pre-existing
HI cloud and heating the gas to a temperature of ~0.5 keV. The low temperature
in the shock is a problem unless we postulate an oblique shock. One member,
NGC7319, hosts a Seyfert 2 nucleus, with an intrinsic luminosity Lx=10^43
erg/s, embedded in a region of more diffuse emission with 10'' radius extent.
The nuclear spectrum can be modeled with a strongly absorbed power-law typical

capable of studying fairly turbulent convection have been enabled by massively

good fraction of the bulk of the convection zone is highly time dependent and
intricate, and is dominated by intermittent upflows and networks of strong
downflows. A high degree of coherent structures involving downflowing plumes
can be embedded in otherwise chaotic flow fields. These vortical structures
play a significant role in yielding Reynolds stresses that serve to
redistribute angular momentum, leading to differential rotation profiles with
pole to equator contrasts of about 30% in angular velocity $\Omega$ and some
constancy along radial line at mid latitudes, thereby making good contact with
deductions from helioseismology. When a magnetic field is introduced, a dynamo

3--D simulations of turbulent convection occurring within the cores of
early-type main sequence stars. Such studies should complement the stellar
structure and evolution efforts that have so far largely employed 1--D nonlocal
mixing length descriptions for the transport, mixing and overshooting achieved
by core convection. We have turned to A-type stars as representative of many of
the dynamical challenges raised by core convection within rotating stars. The
differential rotation and meridional circulations achieved deep within the star
by the convection, the likelihood of sustained magnetic dynamo action there,
and the bringing of fresh fuel into the core by overshooting motions, thereby
influencing main sequence lifetimes, all constitute interesting dynamical
questions that require detailed modelling of global-scale convection. Using our
anelastic spherical harmonic (ASH) code tested on the solar differential
rotation problem, we have conducted a series of 3--D spherical domain
simulations that deal with a simplified description of the central regions of
rotating A-type stars, i.e a convectively unstable core is surrounded by a
stable radiative envelope. A sequence of 3--D simulations are used to assess
the properties of the convection (its global patterns, differential rotation,
meridional circulations, extent and latitudinal variation of the overshooting)
as transitions are made between laminar and turbulent states by changing the
effective diffusivities, rotation rates, and subadiabaticity of the radiative
exterior. We report on the properties deduced from these models for both the
extent of penetration and the profile of rotation sustained by the convection.

primordial origin and others a sign of magnetic dynamo processes. We briefly
review the results of observational studies of solar-type stars seeking to
evaluate the linkage between rotation rate and possible magnetic cycles of
activity. Clearly turbulent convection and rotation within spherical shell
geometries provide ingredients essential for dynamo action. However, intensive
efforts over several decades in solar research have demonstrated that it is no
easy matter to achieve cyclic magnetic activity that is in accord with
observations. Helioseismology has revealed that an essential element for the
global solar dynamo is the presence of a tachocline of shear at the base of the
solar convection zone, leading to the likely operation of an interface dynamo.
We review the crucial elements for achieving a cyclic magnetic activity. We
then discuss some of our current 3--D MHD simulations of solar turbulent
convection in spherical shells that yield differential rotation profiles which
make good contact with some of the helioseismic findings. We show that such
turbulent motions can amplify and sustain magnetic field in the bulk of the
convective zone whose strength are sufficient to feed back both upon the
convection and its global circulations.

discovering and describing planar disorder in close-packed structures (CPSs)
directly from their diffraction spectra. Here we provide the theoretical
development behind those results, adapting computational mechanics to describe
one-dimensional structure in materials. By way of contrast, we give a detailed
analysis of the current alternative approach, the fault model (FM), and offer
several criticisms. We then demonstrate that the computational mechanics
description of the stacking sequence--in the form of an
epsilon-machine--provides the minimal and unique description of the crystal,
whether ordered, disordered, or some combination. We find that we can detect
and describe any amount of disorder, as well as materials that are mixtures of
various kinds of crystalline structure. Underlying this approach is a novel
method for epsilon-machine reconstruction that uses correlation functions
estimated from diffraction spectra, rather than sequences of microscopic
configurations, as is typically used in other domains. The result is that the
methods developed here can be adapted to a wide range of experimental systems
in which spectroscopic data is available.

developes a linear frequency dependence. The complex optical conductivity can
be described by the phenomenological relation \sigma(\omega,T) \propto
(\Gamma(T)+i\omega)^{-1/2} used for cuprates and ruthenates.

  wetting of hexane on brine","27 pages, 2 tables, 4 figures",,"10.1063/1.1573172",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  In recent experiments, a sequence of changes in the wetting state (`wetting
transitions') has been observed upon increasing the temperature in systems
consisting of pentane on pure water and of hexane on brine. This sequence of
two transitions is brought about by an interplay of short-range and long-range
interactions between substrate and adsorbate. In this work, we argue that the
short-range interaction (contact energy) between hexane and pure water remains
unchanged due to the formation of a depletion layer (a thin `layer' of pure
water which is completely devoid of ions) at the surface of the electrolyte and
that the presence of the salt manifests itself only in a modification of the
long-range interaction between substrate and adsorbate. In a five-layer
calculation considering brine, water, the first layer of adsorbed hexane
molecules, liquid hexane, and vapor, we determine the new long-range
interaction of brine with the adsorbate {\em across} the water `layer'.
According to the recent theory of the excess surface tension of an electrolyte
by Levin and Flores-Mena, this water `layer' is of constant, i.e.\
salt-concentration independent, thickness $\delta$, with $\delta$ being the
hydrodynamic radius of the ions in water. Our results are in good agreement
with the experimental ones.

  topology-based approach","14 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft q-bio.BM",,"  A theoretical model for the folding of proteins containing disulfide bonds is
introduced. The model exploits the knowledge of the native state to favour the
progressive establishment of native interactions. At variance with traditional
approaches based on native topology, not all native bonds are treated in the
same way; in particular, a suitable energy term is introduced to account for
the special strength of disulfide bonds (irrespective of whether they are
native or not) as well as their ability to undergo intra-molecular reshuffling.
The model thus possesses the minimal ingredients necessary to investigated the
much debated issue of whether the re-folding process occurs through partially
structured intermediates with native or non-native disulfide bonds. This
strategy is applied to a context of particular interest, the re-folding process
of Hirudin, a thrombin-specific protease inhibitor, for which conflicting
folding pathways have been proposed. We show that the only two parameters in
the model (temperature and disulfide strength) can be tuned to reproduce well a
set of experimental transitions between species with different number of formed
disulfide. This model is then used to provide a characterisation of the folding
process and a detailed description of the species involved in the rate-limiting
step of Hirudin refolding.

the quantum vacuum acts as a dispersive medium for the propagation of light,
since vacuum polarisation in QED induces interactions which effectively violate

perturbative corrections which can precisely be calculated in a scheme with a
hard Wilsonian cutoff at a scale around 1GeV appropriate for the OPE, and to
the potential impact of higher-order power corrections. We point out that the
latter require control over possible contributions from four-quark operators
containing charm quark fields. Analytical expressions are given which allow
evaluating the width with various choices of parameters; ready-to-use
expressions showing the dependence on the heavy quark parameters are presented
as well. We illustrate these results by commenting on how these parameters can
be extracted and what accuracy is likely to be achievable in the near future.

these general observations by explicitly analyzing the effective 4d KK theory

scattering of longitudinal KK gluons or KK weak bosons, a consequence of the
geometric Higgs mechanism, are verified. In the case of the electroweak gauge

Higgs excitations. With the analyses before and after compactification, we
derive the strongest bounds on N_KK from gauge KK scattering. Applying these
bounds to higher-dimensional SUSY GUTs implies that only a small number of KK
states can be used to accelerate gauge coupling unification. As a consequence,
we show that the GUT scale in the 5d minimal SUSY GUT cannot be lower than
about 10^{14} GeV.

  Jour. Func. Analysis",,,,"math.DG math.RT",,"  Let G_R be a Lie group acting on an oriented manifold M, and let $\omega$ be
an equivariantly closed form on M. If both G_R and M are compact, then the
integral $\int_M \omega$ is given by the fixed point integral localization
formula (Theorem 7.11 in [BGV]). Unfortunately, this formula fails when the
acting Lie group G_R is not compact: there simply may not be enough fixed
points present. A proposed remedy is to modify the action of G_R in such a way
that all fixed points are accounted for.
  Let G_R be a real semisimple Lie group, possibly noncompact. One of the most
important examples of equivariantly closed forms is the symplectic volume form
$d\beta$ of a coadjoint orbit $\Omega$. Even if $\Omega$ is not compact, the
integral $\int_{\Omega} d\beta$ exists as a distribution on the Lie algebra
g_R. This distribution is called the Fourier transform of the coadjoint orbit.
  In this article we will apply the localization results described in [L1] and
[L2] to get a geometric derivation of Harish-Chandra's formula (9) for the
Fourier transforms of regular semisimple coadjoint orbits. Then we will make an
explicit computation for the coadjoint orbits of elements of G_R* which are
dual to regular semisimple elements lying in a maximally split Cartan
subalgebra of g_R.

impacted since it appears that the unfurled higher dimensions of string theory
will not permit the existence of energetically stable atoms. This also has
bearing on the search for deviations from 1/r2 of the gravitational force at

strongly temperature-dependent viscosity because of the coupling between the
energy and momentum equations. The heat generated by viscous friction produces
a local temperature increase near the tube walls with a consequent decrease of
the viscosity which may dramatically change the temperature and velocity
profiles. These processes are mainly controlled by the Pecl\'et number, the
Nahme number, the flow rate and the thermal boundary conditions. The problem of
viscous heating in fluids was investigated in the past for its practical
interest in the polymer industry, and was invoked to explain some rheological
behaviours of silicate melts, but was not completely applied to study magma
flows. In this paper we focus on the thermal and mechanical effects caused by
viscous heating in tubes of finite lengths. We find that in magma flows at high
Nahme number and typical flow rates, viscous heating is responsible for the
evolution from Poiseuille flow, with a uniform temperature distribution at the
inlet, to a plug flow with a hotter layer near the walls. When the temperature
gradients induced by viscous heating are very pronounced, local instabilities
may occur and the triggering of secondary flows is possible. For completeness,
this paper also describes magma flow in infinitely long tubes both at steady
state and in transient phase.

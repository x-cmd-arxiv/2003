cosmic evolution to z=1.5 based on a spectroscopic survey of a magnitude
limited sample of galaxies with Ks<20 (the K20 survey, Cimatti et al. 2002b).
The LFs have been derived in the rest-frame J and Ks bands using 3 z bins
(z_mean= 0.5, 1, 1.5) and compared to the local near-IR LF. The faint-end of
the LFs is consistent with the local estimates, with no evidence for a change
either in the slope or normalization up to z<1.3. Viceversa, the density of
luminous galaxies (M_Ks-5logh_70<-25.5) is higher than locally at all z and
relatively constant or mildly increasing with z within our sample. The data are
consistent with a mild luminosity evolution both in the J and Ks-band up to
z=1.5 (DeltaM_J=-0.69+-0.12 and DeltaM_K=-0.54+-0.12 at z=1). Moreover, we find
that red and early-type galaxies dominate the bright-end of the LF, and that
their number density shows at most a small decrease (<30%) up to z=1, thus
suggesting that massive elliptical galaxies were already in place at z=1 and
they should have formed their stars and assembled their mass at higher z. There
appears to be a correlation of the optical/near-IR colors with near-IR
luminosities, the most luminous/massive galaxies being red/old. We find a slow
evolution with z of the near-IR comoving luminosity density to z=1.5. Finally,
we show that hierarchical models overpredict significantly the density of low
luminosity galaxies at z<=1 and underpredict the density of luminous galaxies
at z>=1, whereas PLE models are more consistent with the data up to z=1.5. The
GIF model (Kaufmann et al. 1999) shows a clear deficiency of red luminous
galaxies at z=1 compared to our observations and predicts a decrease of
luminous galaxies with z not observed in our sample.

with respect to M-type stars. In the near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams
provided by the 2MASS and DENIS surveys, the LMC C-type stars draw a striking
red tail, well separated from the sequences of O-rich giants. So far, this
conspicuous feature has been absent from any set of available isochrones, even
the few existing ones that include the TP-AGB evolution of low- and
intermediate-mass stars. To investigate such issue we simulate the complete
2MASS Ks vs.(J-Ks) data towards the LMC by means of a population synthesis
approach, that relies on extended libraries of published stellar evolutionary
tracks, including the TP-AGB phase. The simulations provide quite a detailed
description of the several vertical fingers and inclined sequences seen in
2MASS data, due to both Galactic foreground and LMC O-rich stars. Instead, as
mentioned, the red tail of C-stars sets a major difficulty: we find that TP-AGB
models with solar-scaled molecular opacities, the usual assumption of existing
AGB calculations, do not succeed in reproducing this feature. Our tests
indicate that the main reason for this failure should not be ascribed to
empirical Teff - (J-K) transformations for C-type stars. Instead, the
discrepancy is simply removed by adopting new evolutionary models that account
for the changes in molecular opacities as AGB stars get enriched in carbon via
the third dredge-up (Marigo 2002). In fact, simulations that adopt these models
are able to reproduce, for the first time, the red tail of C-stars in
near-infrared CMDs. Finally, we point out that these simulations also provide
useful indications about the efficiency of the third dredge-up process, and the
pulsation modes of long-period variables.

elliptical models and assuming several masses for its dark matter halo. The
effect of the cD orientation with respect to the mass distribution of the host
galaxy cluster is also investigated. The simulations are carried out in an open
and a flat model universe with cosmological constant. We find that the
enhancement of the cluster lensing cross sections for long and thin arcs due to
the presence of a massive cD at the cluster centre is typically less than 100%,
depending on the model used for the cD galaxy and its orientation. The impact
of the cD on the cluster efficiency for producing radially magnified images is
larger only for those clusters whose lensing cross section for radial arcs is
very small in absence of the central galaxy. We conclude that the presence of a
cD galaxy at the cluster centre can only moderately influence the cluster
efficiency for strong lensing and in particular fails to explain the
discrepancy between the observed number of giant arcs in galaxy clusters and
their abundance predicted from lensing simulations in the currently most
favoured $\Lambda$CDM model.

degree of fragmentation decreases with increasing \new{polytropic exponent}
$\gamma$ in the range $0.2 < \gamma < 1.4$, although the total amount of
\new{mass accreted onto collapsed fragments} appears to remain roughly constant
through that range. Low values of $\gamma$ are expected to lead to the
formation of dense clusters of low-mass stars, while $\gamma>1$ probably
results in the formation of isolated and massive stars. Fragmentation and
collapse ceases entirely for $\gamma > 1.4$ as expected from analytic
arguments. The mass spectrum of overdense gas clumps is roughly log-normal for
{\em non}-self-gravitating turbulent gas, but changes to a power-law under the
action of gravity. The spectrum of collapsed cores, on the other hand, remains
log-normal for $\gamma\le 1$, but flattens markedly for $\gamma >1$. The
density PDFs approach log-normal, with widths that decrease with increasing
$\gamma$. Primordial gas may have effective $\gamma > 1$, in which case these
results could help explain why models of the formation of the first stars tend
to produce isolated, massive objects.

procedure can be applied to any HIRES spectrum, or any other spectrum. While

of energy by 0.25%/keV to 0.9%/keV between 3-20 keV, and are as large as 20% in
the 13-20 keV band. We also show that the pulses observed in the higher energy
bands generally lag behind those in lower energy bands by 0.002 cycles/keV to
0.007 cycles/keV between 3-20 keV. This amounts to total delays of 0.03-0.12
cycles between the lowest and highest energy bands, or time delays that range
from 100-200 mus. We then model the oscillations as flux variations arising
from temperature patterns on the surfaces of rapidly rotating neutron stars. In
this framework, we find that the increase in the pulse amplitude with photon
energy can be explained if the cooler regions on the neutron star emit in the
lower energy bands, reducing the flux variations there. On the other hand, the
Doppler shifts caused by the rapid rotation of the neutron star should cause
the hard pulses to precede the soft pulses by about 0.05 cycles (100 mus), in
contrast to the observations. This suggests that the photons originating from
the stellar surface are reprocessed by a hot corona of electrons before they
reach the observer.

measured on slit spectra is much higher than theoretically predicted under the

enhanced 2-photon emission as the most probable source of the additional
continuum. While T_e and N_e derived from the diagnostic diagram agree with the
most recent determination, T_e derived from lambda 5007/lambda 4363 is smaller

pulsars. The key ingredient of the model is the gap region (i.e. the region
where particle acceleration is taking place and high-energy photons originate)
which satisfies the following assumptions: i) the gap region extends from each
polar cap to the light cylinder; ii) the gap is thin and confined to the
surface of last open magnetic-field lines; iii) photon emissivity is uniform
within the gap region. The model lightcurves are dominated by strong peaks
(either double or single) of caustic origin. Unlike in other pulsar models with
caustic effects, the double peaks arise due to crossing two caustics, each of
which is associated with a different magnetic pole. The generic features of the
lightcurves are consistent with the observed characteristics of pulsar
lightcurves: 1) the most natural (in terms of probability) shape consists of
two peaks (separated by 0.4 to 0.5 in phase for large viewing angles); 2) the
peaks posess well developed wings; 3) there is a bridge (inter-peak) emission
component; 4) there is a non-vanishing off-pulse emission level; 5) the radio

four gamma-ray pulsars - Crab, Vela, Geminga and B1951+32 - with double-peak
lightcurves exhibiting the peak separation of 0.4 to 0.5 in phase. Hereby, we
apply the model to the Vela pulsar. Moreover, we indicate the limitation of the

narrowly separated (about 0.2 in phase) pulse peaks. We also discuss the

Given the current variety in dark energy models and the expected improvement in
observational data, an accurate and versatile diagnostic of dark energy is the
need of the hour. This paper examines the Statefinder diagnostic in the light
of the proposed SNAP satellite which is expected to observe about 2000
supernovae per year. We show that the Statefinder is versatile enough to
differentiate between dark energy models as varied as the cosmological constant
on the one hand, and quintessence, the Chaplygin gas and braneworld models, on
the other. Using SNAP data, the Statefinder can distinguish a cosmological
constant ($w=-1$) from quintessence models with $w \geq -0.9$ and Chaplygin gas
models with $\kappa \leq 15$ at the $3\sigma$ level if the value of $\om$ is
known exactly. The Statefinder gives reasonable results even when the value of
$\om$ is known to only $\sim 20%$ accuracy. In this case, marginalizing over
$\om$ and assuming a fiducial LCDM model allows us to rule out quintessence
with $w \geq -0.85$ and the Chaplygin gas with $\kappa \leq 7$ (both at
$3\sigma$). These constraints can be made even tighter if we use the
Statefinders in conjunction with the deceleration parameter. The Statefinder is
very sensitive to the total pressure exerted by all forms of matter and
radiation in the universe. It can therefore differentiate between dark energy
models at moderately high redshifts of $z \lleq 10$.

although a field of H = 7 T applied at T = 5 K after zero field cooling is
insufficient to convert the low temperature charge ordered antiferromagnetic

induces ferromagnetic clusters in the charge ordered matrix. The volume phase
fraction of the ferromagnetic clusters increases nearly linearly with the
annealing field until Han = 4 T and then changes dramatically from about 11 %

macro polar domains in relaxor ferroelectrics. It is suggested that charge
ordered clusters coexist with ferromagnetic phase above the Neel temperature

isotropic or anisotropic. We then investigate the Weyl curvature conjecture,
according to which some measure of the Weyl curvature is related to a
gravitational entropy. In particular, we study the Weyl curvature conjecture on
the brane with respect to the dimensionless ratio of the Weyl invariant and the
Ricci square and the measure proposed by Gr{\o}n and Hervik. We also argue that
the Weyl curvature conjecture should be formulated on brane
  (i.e., in the four-dimensional context).

Siu on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday",,,,"math.AG math.AC math.CV",,"  We study in this paper some local invariants attached via multiplier ideals
to an effective divisor or ideal sheaf on a smooth complex variety. First
considered (at least implicitly) by Libgober and by Loeser and Vaquie, these
jumping coefficients consist of an increasing sequence of rational numbers
beginning with the log canonical threshold of the divisor or ideal in question.
They encode interesting geometric and algebraic information, and we show that
they arise naturally in several different contexts. Given a polynomial f having
only isolated singularities, results of Varchenko, Loeser and Vaquie imply that
if \xi is a jumping number of f = 0 lying in the interval (0, 1], then -\xi is
a root of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial of f. We adapt an argument of Kollar to
show prove that this holds also when the singular locus of f has positive
dimension. In a more algebraic direction, we show that the number of such
jumping coefficients bounds the uniform Artin-Rees number of the principal
ideal (f) in the sense of Huneke: in the case of isolated singularities, this
in turn leads to bounds involving the Milnor and Tyurina numbers of f . Along
the way, we establish a general result relating multiplier to Jacobian ideals.
We also explore the extension of these ideas to the setting of graded families
of ideals. The paper contains many concrete examples.

that these operations give h_*(LM) the structure of a unital, commutative
Frobenius algebra without a counit. Equivalently they describe a positive
boundary, two dimensional topological quantum field theory associated to
h_*(LM). This implies that there are operations corresponding to any surface
with p incoming and q outgoing boundary components, so long as q >0. The
absence of a counit follows from the nonexistence of an operation associated to
the disk, D^2, viewed as a cobordism from the circle to the empty set. We will
study homological obstructions to constructing such an operation, and show that
in order for such an operation to exist, one must take h_*(LM) to be an
appropriate homological pro-object associated to the loop space. Motivated by
this, we introduce a prospectrum associated to LM when M has an almost complex
structure. Given such a manifold its loop space has a canonical polarization of
its tangent bundle, which is the fundamental feature needed to define this
prospectrum. We refer to this as the ""polarized Atiyah - dual"" of LM . An
appropriate homology theory applied to this prospectrum would be a candidate
for a theory that supports string topology operations associated to any

  in Acta Physica Slovaca 50 (2000) 381",,,,"physics.gen-ph physics.class-ph",,"  The phrase ""negative squared rest mass"" can sometimes be found in papers on
neutrinos and frequently occurs in the tachyonic literature. Consequently, some
authors say that ""the rest mass of tachyons is imaginary"". Besides, the
statement ""photons have zero rest mass"" is almost common. In terms of
relativity, however, the state of rest cannot be reasonably defined for luxons
and tachyons, and, therefore, today it does not make sense to speak of rest
mass of such objects. It is shown here that the phrases ""negative squared
mass"", ""imaginary mass"", and ""photon's zero mass"" result from applying
bradyonic dynamical relativistic relations to determine properties of luxons
and tachyons; and that this erroneous procedure results from an unfortunate
interpretation of kinematical relativistic relations. It is also shown that the
use of proper relativistic relations, i.e. luxonic or tachyonic ones, gives a
positive quantity having the squared mass dimension. Thus we obtain a nonzero
real quantity having the mass dimension (called masslike quantity), which is
positive for the photon and may (by intuition - should) be positive for other
luxons and for tachyons.

biconnectedness topology using two-qubit maximally entangled states. We show
how to generate cyclic evolutions of these states, which are in one-to-one
correspondence to closed paths in SO(3). The difference between the well known
two classes of such paths translates into the gain of a global phase of $\pi$
for one class and no phase change for the other. We propose a simple quantum
optics interference experiment to demonstrate this topological phase shift.

consists of a set of metastable quantum energy levels. We probe the spacings of
these levels by using microwave spectroscopy to enhance the escape rate to the
voltage state. The widths of the resonances give a measurement of the coherence
time of the two states involved in the transitions. We observe a decoherence
time shorter than that expected from dissipation alone in resonantly isolated
20 um x 5 um Al/AlOx/Al junctions at 60 mK. The data is well fit by a model
including dephasing effects of both low-frequency current noise and the escape
rate to the continuum voltage states. We discuss implications for quantum
computation using current-biased Josephson junction qubits, including the
minimum number of levels needed in the well to obtain an acceptable error limit
per gate.

substantial star formation at high redshift z~17 +/- 5. On the other hand, the
recovered sigma_8 ~ 0.84 +/-0.04 disfavors a cluster Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ)
origin for the observed small-scale-CMB fluctuation excess, which generally
requires sigma_8 ~ 1.1. Here we consider the effects of high-redshift star
formation on the CMB. We derive a fairly model-independent relation between the
electron scattering optical depth and the number of ionizing photons emitted
per baryon, and use this to calibrate the amount of high-redshift supernova
activity. The resulting supernova remnants Compton cool against the CMB
creating a Compton-y distortion y ~ few x 10^-6, within observational bounds.
However they also create small-scale SZ fluctuations, which could be comparable
with SZ fluctuations from unresolved galaxy clusters. This raises the exciting
possibility that we have already detected signatures of the first stars not
just once, but twice, in the CMB.

(a=0.47 AU) orbit. We study how it might arrive at such an orbit and how it has
avoided being tidally circularized until now. The presence of a stellar
companion to the host star suggests the possibility that the Kozai mechanism
and tidal dissipation combined to draw the planet inward well after it formed:
Kozai oscillations produce periods of extreme eccentricity in the planet orbit,
and the tidal dissipation that occurs during these periods of small pericentre
distances leads to gradual orbital decay. We call this migration mechanism the
'Kozai migration'. It requires that the initial planet orbit is highly inclined
relative to the binary orbit. For a companion at 1000 AU and an initial planet
orbit at 5 AU, the minimum relative inclination required is ~ 85. We discuss
the efficiency of tidal dissipation inferred from the observations of
exo-planets. Moreover, we investigate possible explanations for the velocity
residual (after the motion induced by the planet is removed) observed on the
host star: a second planet in the system is excluded over a large extent of
semi-major axis space if Kozai migration is to work, and the tide raised on the
star by HD 80606b is likely too small in amplitude. Lastly, we discuss the
relevance of Kozai migration for other planetary systems.

perturbations on the last scattering surface (LSS) of the cosmic microwave

the CMBR temperature and polarization anisotropies at large l > 1000 or so,
like the excess power detected by the CBI experiment. The magnetic contribution
can be distinguished from most conventional signals, as they lead to CMBR
polarization dominated by the odd parity, B-type signal. Experiments like DASI
and WMAP have detected evidence for CMBR polarization at small l. Many
experiments will also probe the large $l$ regime. We therefore calculate the
polarization signals due to primordial magnetic fields, for different spectra
and different cosmological parameters. A scale-invariant spectrum of tangled
fields which redshifts to a present value B_{0}=3\times 10^{-9} Gauss, produces
B-type polarization anisotropies of order 0.3 - 0.4 micro Kelvin between l of
1000-5000. Larger signals result if the spectral index of magnetic tangles is
steeper, n>-3. The peak of the signal shifts to larger l for a lambda-dominated
universe, or if the baryon density is larger. The signal will also have
non-Gaussian statistics. We also predict the much smaller E-type polarization,
and T-E cross correlations for these models.

irreducible rational representations of the group $GL_M$ are labeled by pairs

parts of $\mu$ and $\tilde{\mu}$ does not exceed $M$. Let $U$ be the
representation of $GL_M$ corresponding to such a pair. Regard the direct
product $GL_N\times GL_M$ as a subgroup of $GL_{N+M}$. Let $V$ be the
irreducible rational representation of the group $GL_{N+M}$ corresponding to a
pair of partitions $\lambda$ and $\tilde{\lambda}$. Consider the vector space
$W=Hom_{G_M}(U,V)$. It comes with a natural action of the group $GL_N$. Let $n$
be sum of parts of $\lambda$ less the sum of parts of $\mu$. Let $\tilde{n}$ be
sum of parts of $\tilde{\lambda}$ less the sum of parts of $\tilde{\mu}$. For
any choice of two standard Young tableaux of skew shapes $\lambda/\mu$ and
$\tilde{\lambda}/\tilde{\mu}$ respectively, we realize $W$ as a subspace in the
tensor product of $n$ copies of the defining $N$-dimensional representation of
$GL_N$, and of $\tilde{n}$ copies of the contragredient representation. This
subspace is determined as the image of a certain linear operator $F$ in the
tensor product, given by explicit multiplicative formula. When M=0 and $W=V$ is
an irreducible representation of $GL_N$, we recover the classical realization
of $V$ as a subspace in the space of all traceless tensors. Then the operator
$F$ can be regarded as the rational analogue of the Young symmetrizer,
corresponding to the chosen standard tableau of shape $\lambda$. Even in the
special case M=0, our formula for the operator $F$ is new. Our results are
applications of representation theory of the Yangian of the Lie algebra $gl_N$.

  Measurements using a Beam of Cold Stable or Radioactive Atoms","13 pages, 4 figures, 1 table",,"10.1140/epjd/e2003-00215-5",,"physics.atom-ph",,"  Laser cooling and trapping offers the possibility of confining a sample of
radioactive atoms in free space. Here, we address the question of how best to
take advantage of cold atom properties to perform the observation of as highly
forbidden a line as the 6S-7S Cs transition for achieving, in the longer term,
Atomic Parity Violation measurements in radioactive alkali isotopes. Another
point at issue is whether one might do better with stable, cold atoms than with
thermal atoms. To compensate for the large drawback of the small number of
atoms available in a trap, one must take advantage of their low velocity. To
lengthen the time of interaction with the excitation laser, we suggest choosing
a geometry where the laser beam exciting the transition is colinear to a slow,
cold atomic beam, either extracted from a trap or prepared by Zeeman slowing.
We also suggest a new observable physical quantity manifesting APV, which
presents several advantages:specificity, efficiency of detection, possibility
of direct calibration by a parity conserving quantity of a similar nature. It
is well adapted to a configuration where the cold atomic beam passes through
two regions of transverse, crossed electric fields, leading both to
differential measurements and to strong reduction of the contributions from the
M_1-Stark interference signals, potential sources of systematics in APV
measurements. Our evaluation of signal to noise ratios shows that with
available techniques, measurements of transition amplitudes, important as
required tests of Atomic Theory should be possible in cesium 133 with a
statistical precision of 1/1000 and probably also in Fr isotopes for production
rates of 10^6 Fr atoms/s.

q, k and the state vector of the particle. A weak bound is given by the
inequality P <= dkdq/h, where h is Planck's quantum of action. It is
non-trivial for all measurements with dkdq < h. A sharper bound is obtained by

process of a particle as a two-dimensional Markov process in a logarithmic
momentum-time space, and relate the solution of the Markov process with the
particle distribution function at the shock front, for both steady and
time-dependent case. For the case where the probability density function of the
energy gain and cycle-time at each shock crossing of the particles obeys a
scaling law in momentum, which is usually assumed in the literature, it is
confirmed in more general form that the energy distribution of particles has
the power-law feature in steady state. The equation to determine the exact
power-law index which is applicable for any shock speed is derived and it is
shown that the power-law index, in general, depends on the shape of the
probability density function of the energy gain at each shock crossing; in
particular for relativistic shocks, the dispersion of the energy gain can
influence the power-law index. It is also shown that the time-dependent

X-ray sources. We attribute this to photoelectronic absorption by the stellar
wind. The high opacity of the metal-rich and dense winds from WC stars puts the
radius of optical depth unity at hundreds or thousands of stellar radii for
much of the X-ray band. We believe that the essential absence of hot plasma so
far out in the wind exacerbated by the large distances and correspondingly high
ISM column densities makes the WC stars too faint to be detectable with current
technology. The result also applies to many WC stars in binary systems, of
which only about 20% are identified X-ray sources, presumably due to colliding

nonabsorbing wind component. We present a simple formula for the calculation of

the redshift interval from 2.3 to 3.4. The sample includes 4 new UVES/VLT
measurements of Ar I column densities. The majority of DLAs show significant
underabundances of Ar relative to other alpha-capture elements with common
nucleosynthetic origin. We show that neither dust depletion nor intervening HII
regions inside DLAs offer a viable justification to these underabundances. A
natural explanation is found in the framework of photoionization models of HI
regions embedded in an ionizing continuum with varying spectral distribution.
At z ~ 2.5 the observed Ar deficiencies are large, [Ar/alpha] ~ -0.6/-0.8 dex,
suggestive of a hard, QSO-dominated spectrum. At z >~ 3 the deficiencies are
instead small, suggestive of a soft, stellar-type spectrum, though more data
are needed to generalize this high-z result. We argue that the change of Ar
abundances is induced by the evolution of the UV metagalactic continuum, in
which case the UV emission internal to DLAs must be small (i.e. DLAs should
have modest star formation rates) and the external background must become
softer at z > 3. The former requirement is consistent with the modest evolution
of DLAs abundances and the lack of Ly_alpha and H_alpha emissions associated
with DLAs. The latter requirement is consistent with the observed evolution of
SiIV/CIV ratios in the IGM, the claims of high escape fraction of UV photons
from Ly-break galaxies at z >~ 3, and the recent finding that the HeII
re-ionization seems to occur between z ~ 3.4 and z ~ 3. From the comparison
with local interstellar studies, we predict a rise of Ar abundances in the
redshift range from z ~ 2.3 to z=0, at the epoch at which the metagalactic
field of galaxies overcomes that of quasars.

Significant temporal (and spectral) variability on both short and long time

large-amplitude variations on time scales of several hours with large changes
in the intervening absorption, suggestive of the X-ray emission being eclipsed
by the accretion stream (and thus of the X-ray emission being partly or totally

clustered around Z = 0.2, while the CTTS sources span almost two orders of

appear to be systematically enhanced with respect to Fe in the WTTS stars. The
significant differences between the spectral and temporal characteristics of

Owing to the strongly stable stratification, the mean radial shear is stable,
while the horizontal shear is expected to drive predominantly horizontal,
quasi-2D motions in thin slabs. Here I suggest that a major source of 3D
overturning turbulent motions in the tachocline is the secondary shear
instability due to the strong, random vertical shear arising between the
uncorrelated horizontal flows in neighbouring slabs. A formula for the vertical
diffusivity due to this turbulence, equation (9), is derived and applied in a
simplified 1D model of the tachocline. It is found that Maxwell stresses due to
an oscillatory poloidal magnetic field of a few hundred gauss are able to
confine the tachocline to a thickness below 5 Mm. The integral scale of the 3D
overturning turbulence is the buoyancy scale, on the order of 10 km and its
velocity amplitude is a few m/s, yielding a vertical turbulent diffusivity on
the order of 10^8 cm^2/s.

substituted to varying degree with Li or Cu at the Mg-site and by Li or Cu at
the Mg-site along with C substitution at the B-site. DC resistivity and ac

T$_{C}$ versus the electron count (estimated from simple chemical valence count
arguments) shows a universal behaviour, with T$_{C}$ being constant at the
MgB$_{2}$ value for electron counts lower than in MgB$_{2}$ but rapidly
decreasing for larger electron counts. The temperature dependence of
resistivity in the normal state fits to the Bloch- Gruneisen formula, from
which the Debye temperature, $\theta_{D}$, and the $\rho_{0}$ are extracted.
$\theta_{D}$ variation with T$_{C}$ is not systematic, whereas $\rho_{0}$
versus T$_{C}$ shows a systematic variation that depends on the type of the
chemical substituent. This dependence has a signature of the nature of the
intraband/interband scattering affected by the chemical substitutions.
d$\rho$/dT increases with C substitution, but decreases with Li and Cu
substitution, implying that C substitution leads to the domination of
conductivity by the $\sigma$ band, while in the Li/Cu substituted samples the
$\pi$ band dominates conduction.

thickness hypothesis in 't Hooft's brick wall model as well as the boundary
condition imposed for the field considered. For concreteness, we consider a
noncommutative scalar field model near the horizon and derive the effective
metric via the equation of motion of noncommutative scalar field. This metric
displays a new horizon in addition to the original one associated with the
Schwarzschild black hole. The infinite red-shifting of the scalar field on the
new horizon determines the range of the noncommutativ space and explains the
relevant boundary condition for the field. This range enables us to calculate
the entropy of black hole as proportional to the area of its original horizon
along the same line as in 't Hooft's model, and the thickness of the brick wall
is found to be proportional to the thermal average of the noncommutative
space-time range. The Hawking temperature has been derived in this formalism.
The study here represents an attempt to reveal some physics beyond the brick
wall model.

nonabelian generalization of electric--magnetic duality derived some years ago.
This nonabelian duality implies the existence of another SU(3) symmetry dual to
colour, which is necessarily broken when colour is confined and so can play the
role of the ``horizontal'' symmetry for fermion generations. When thus
identified, dual colour then predicts 3 and only 3 fermion generations, besides
suggesting a special Higgs mechanism for breaking the generation symmetry. A
phenomenological model with a Higgs potential and a Yukawa coupling constructed
on these premises is shown to explain immediately all the salient qualitative
features of the fermion mass hierarchy and mixing pattern, excepting for the
moment CP-violation. Calculations already carried out to 1-loop order is shown
to give with only 3 adjustable parameters the following quantities all to
within present experimental error: all 9 CKM matrix elements $|V_{rs}|$ for
quarks, the neutrino oscillation angles or the MNS lepton mixing matrix
elements $|U_{\mu 3}|, |U_{e 3}|$, and the mass ratios $m_c/m_t, m_s/m_b,
m_\mu/m_\tau$. The special feature of this model crucial for deriving the above
results is a fermion mass matrix which changes its orientation (rotates) in
generation space with changing energy scale, a feature which is shown to have
direct empirical support.

toward equilibrium even in observables which are not locally conserved. A
classic example is the stress-stress correlator in a normal fluid, which, at

effective theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations in supersymmetric theories is the
presence of Grassmann-valued classical fields describing macroscopic
supercharge density fluctuations. We show that hydrodynamic fluctuations in
supersymmetric theories generate essentially the same long-time power-law tails
in real-time correlation functions that are known in simple fluids. In
particular, a t^{-3/2} long-time tail must exist in the stress-stress
correlator of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at non-zero temperature,
regardless of the value of the coupling. Consequently, this feature of
finite-temperature dynamics can provide an interesting test of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. However, the coefficient of this long-time tail is suppressed
by a factor of 1/N_c^2. On the gravitational side, this implies that these
long-time tails are not present in the classical supergravity limit; they must

HA the category of torsionless (or flat) Hopf algebras over R. We call any H in
HA ""quantized function algebra"" (=QFA), resp. ""quantized (restricted) universal
enveloping algebra"" (=QrUEA), at h if H/hH is the function algebra of a
connected Poisson group, resp. the (restricted, if R/hR has positive
characteristic) universal enveloping algebra of a (restricted) Lie bialgebra.
  We establish an ""inner"" Galois' correspondence on HA, via the definition of
two endofunctors, ()^\vee and ()', of HA such that:
  (a) the image of ()^\vee, resp. of ()', is the full subcategory of all
QrUEAs, resp. all QFAs, at h; (b) if R/hR has zero characteristic, the
restriction of ()^\vee to QFAs and of ()' to QrUEAs yield equivalences inverse
to each other; (c) if R/hR has zero characteristic, starting from a QFA over a
Poisson group, resp. from a QrUEA over a (restricted) Lie bialgebra, the
functor ()^\vee, resp. ()', gives a QrUEA, resp. a QFA, over the dual Lie
bialgebra, resp. the dual Poisson group.
  In particular, (a) yields a recipe to produce quantum groups of both types
(QFAs or QrUEAs), (b) gives a characterization of them within HA, and (c) gives
a ""global"" version of the ""quantum duality principle"" after Drinfeld. We then
apply our result to Hopf algebras defined over a field k and extended to the
polynomial ring k[h]: this yields quantum groups, hence ""classical"" geometrical
symmetries of Poisson type (via specialization) associated to the ""generalized
symmetry"" encoded by the original Hopf algebra over k. Both the main result and
the above mentioned application are illustrated via several examples of many
different kinds, which are studied in full detail.

of a weak axial flow in case of a very short cylinder with a narrow annulus
gap. We consider an incompressible viscous fluid which is contained in the
narrow gap between two concentric short cylinders, where the inner cylinder
rotates with constant angular velocity. The caps of the cylinders have narrow
tubes conically tapering to super narrow slits which allow for an axial flow
along the surface of the inner cylinder. The approximated solution for the
Couette flow for short cylinders was found and used for the stability analysis
instead of the exact but bulky solution. The sensitivity of the Couette flow to
general small perturbations and to the weak axial flow was studied. We
demonstrate that perturbations coming from the axial flow cause the propagation
of dispersive waves in the Taylor-Couette flow. The coexistence of a rotation
and of an axial flow requires to study in addition to the energy and the
angular momentum also the helicity of the flow. The approximated form for the
helicity formula in case of short cylinders was derived. We found that the
axial flow stabilizes the Taylor - Couette flow. The supercritical flow
includes a rich variety of vortical structures including a symmetric pair of
Taylor vortices, an anomalous single vortex and quasi periodic oscillating
vortices. Pattern formation was studied at large for rated ranges of azimuthal
and axial Reynolds numbers. A region where three branches of different states
occur was localized. Numerical simulations in 3D and in axisymmetrical case of
the model flow are presented, which illustrate the instabilities analyzed.

that the PVD of the young galaxies is lower than that of the old types, and
even of all galaxies together, especially at small separations. These results
are in reasonable agreement with the recent measurements of PVDs in the Las
Campanas redshift survey, the PSCz catalogue and the SDSS data. We also find
that the low PVD of young galaxies is due to the effects of dynamical friction
as well as the different spatial distribution. We also consider the mean infall
velocity and the POTENT density reconstruction that are often used to measure
the cosmological parameters, and investigate the effects of spatial bias and
dynamical friction. In our simulation, the mean infall velocity of young
galaxies is significantly lower than that of all the galaxies or of the old
galaxies, and the dynamical bias becomes important on scales less than 3Mpc/h.
The mass density field reconstructed from the velocity field of young galaxies
using the POTENT-style method suffers in accuracy both from the spatial bias
and the dynamical friction on the smoothing scale of R_s=8Mpc/h. On the other

imply that SNIa have contributed ~80% of the iron mass within a 100 kpc radius

similar to that of the Milky Way. At the very center (R ~2 kpc) the XMM and

dynamics, which take proper account of the collisional interaction of SIDM

These similarity solutions are relevant to galactic and cluster halo formation
in the cold dark matter (CDM) model. Different solutions arise for different
values of the dimensionless collisionality parameter, Q=sigma*rho_b*r_s, where
sigma is the SIDM particle scattering cross section per unit mass, rho_b is the
cosmic mean density, and r_s is the shock radius. For all solutions, a
flat-density, isothermal core is present which grows in size as a fixed
fraction of r_s, pumped by cosmological infall. Accordingly, core collapse must
in general be delayed until infall becomes negligible, contrary to previous
analyses based on isolated halos, which predict core collapse in a Hubble time.
Our solutions agree with N-body simulations, which match observed galactic
rotation curves if sigma=[0.56 - 5.6]cm^2/g, implying Q=[6.2e-7 - 3.6e-5].
Similar profiles also arise for Q=[1.37e-2 - 1.7e-1], or sigma=[1.2e4 -

related to each other and to their formation histories. A similar, but
distinct, and also long standing question is whether the structural appearances

physical information to offer this classification. We argue through the use of
240 images of nearby galaxies that three model independent parameters measured
on a single galaxy image reveal its major ongoing and past formation modes, and
can be used as a robust classification system. These parameters quantitatively
measure: the concentration (C), asymmetry (A) and clumpiness (S) of a galaxy's
stellar light distribution. When combined into a three dimensional `CAS' volume
all major classes of galaxies in various phases of evolution are cleanly
distinguished. We argue that these three parameters correlate with important
modes of galaxy evolution: star formation and major merging activity. This is
argued through the strong correlation of Halpha equivalent width and broad band
colors with the clumpiness parameter, the uniquely large asymmetries of 66
galaxies undergoing mergers, and the correlation of bulge to total light
ratios, and stellar masses, with the concentration index. As an obvious goal is
to use this system at high redshifts to trace evolution, we demonstrate that
these parameters can be measured, within a reasonable and quantifiable
uncertainty, with available data out to z ~ 3 using the Hubble Space Telescope

a fully self-adaptive technique for reconstructing continuous density fields
from discrete particle distributions, and is based upon the corresponding
Delaunay tessellation. Its principal asset is its complete independence of
arbitrary smoothing functions and parameters specifying the properties of
these. As a result it manages to faithfully reproduce the anisotropies of the
local particle distribution and through its adaptive and local nature proves to
be optimally suited for uncovering the full structural richness in the density
distribution. Through the improvement in local density estimates, calculations
invoking the DTFE will yield a much better representation of physical processes

the application and insertion of the DTFE in astrophysical hydrocodes. We

  Rev. B",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.68.085203",,"cond-mat",,"  We study the structure, the formation and binding energies and the transfer
levels of the zinc-phosphorus vacancy complex [Zn_In - V_P] in Zn doped p-type
InP, as a function of the charge, using plane wave ab initio DFT-LDA
calculations in a 64 atom supercell. We find a binding energy of 0.39 eV for
the complex, which is neutral in p-type material, the 0/-1 transfer level lying
0.50 eV above the valence band edge, all in agreement with recent positron
annihilation experiments. This indicates that, whilst the formation of
phosphorus vacancies (V_P) may be involved in carrier compensation in heavily
Zn doped material, the formation of Zn-vacancy complexes is not.
  Regarding the structure: for charge states Q=+6 to -4 the Zn atom is in an
sp^2 bonded DX position and electrons added/removed go to/come from the
remaining dangling bonds on the triangle of In atoms. This reduces the
effective vacancy volume monatonically as electrons are added to the complex,
also in agreement with experiment. The reduction occurs through a combination
of increased In-In bonding and increased Zn-In electrostatic attraction. In
addition, for certain charge states we find complex Jahn-Teller behaviour in
which up to three different structures, (with the In triangle dimerised,
antidimerised or symmetric) are stable and are close to degenerate. We are able
to predict and successfully explain the structural behaviour of this complex
using a simple tight binding model.

complex phase-space structure with many attractors with their basins of
attraction. The presence of random asymmetry in the couplings results in better
retrieval performance of the network by enhancing the size of the basin of
attraction of the stored pattern and by making the recall of memory
significantly faster.

equilibrium statistical mechanics of systems are examined. Broadly, they fall
into: (i) probabilistic paaroaches based on the principle of equal a priori
probability (counting technique and method of steepest descents), law of large
numbers, or the state density considerations and (ii) a variational scheme --
maximum entropy principle (due to Gibbs and Jaynes) subject to certain
constraints. A minimum set of requirements on each of these methods are briefly
pointed out: in the first approach, the function space and the counting
algorithm while in the second, ""additivity"" property of the entropy with
respect to the composition of statistically independent systems. In the past
few decades, a large number of systems, which are not necessarily in
thermodynamic equilibrium (such as glasses, for example), have been found to
display power-law distributions, which are not describable by the
above-mentioned methods. In this paper, parallel to all the inquiries
underlying the BG program described above are given in a brief form. In
particular, in the probabilistic derivations, one employs a different function
space and one gives up ""additivity"" in the variational scheme with a different
form for the entropy. The requirement of stability makes the entropy choice to
be that proposed by Tsallis. From this a generalized thermodynamic description
of the system in a quasi-equilibrium state is derived. A brief account of a
unified consistent formalism associated with systems obeying power-law
distributions precursor to the exponential form associated with thermodynamic
equilibrium of systems is presented here.

that for a non commensurable filling factor, in the strong interaction limit, a
controlled growing of the disorder drives a dynamical transition from
superfluid to Bose-glass phase. Similarly, in the weak interaction limit, a
dynamical transition from superfluid to Anderson-glass phase may be observed.
In both regimes, we show that even very low-intensity disorder-inducing lasers
cause large modifications of the superfluid fraction of the system.

The observed magnetic moment from neutron diffraction, which is small compared

introducing vacancies at random positions in the wire and thus preserving the
chiral symmetry. For quasi one-dimensional geometries and low concentration of
vacancies, an exponential decay of the mean conductance with the wire length is
obtained even at the center of the energy band. For wide wires, finite size
effects cause the conductance to decay following a non-pure exponential law. We
propose an analytical formula for the mean conductance that reproduces
accurately the numerical data for both geometries. However, when the
concentration of vacancies increases above a critical value, a transition
towards the suppression of the conductance occurs.
  This is a signature of the presence of ultra-localized states trapped in

QCD-based methods are discussed concerning their potentials as well as their
short-comings. The latter are overcome by combining these techniques. The
utilized methods are (i) the chiral constituent quark model deduced from the
instanton vacuum model and large-N_c arguments, (ii) chiral perturbation theory
unitarized by the inverse amplitude method and (iii) QCD sum rules. Advantages
of the combination of these methods are especially the absence of un-physical
quark-production thresholds and parameter-free results. Already in the chiral
limit and in leading order in 1/N_c one obtains a reasonable result for the
mass of the rho-meson, namely m_rho = 790 \pm 30 MeV. Using the KSFR relation
the universality of the rho-meson coupling is recovered. The latter is found to
be g = 6.0 \pm 0.3.

in which an essentially inhomogeneous scalar field representing matter is
coupled to an essentially homogeneous scalar inflaton field. Through this
coupling, the potential determining the evolution of the inflaton field is made
time-dependent. Due to this the frequency of parametric resonance becomes time
dependent, making the reheating process especially effective. All fields
including the gravitational field are initially simplified by expanding each in
terms of the respective homogeneity or inhomogeneity. Employing only the lowest
order of this expansion, we space-average, and introduce all independent
averages as new variables. This leads to a hierarchy of equations for the
spatial moments of the fields and their derivatives. A small expansion
parameter permits a truncation to lowest order, yielding a closed system of 5
coupled nonlinear first order differential equations. For a parabolic
potential, the energy densities of the matter and inflaton fields oscillate
chaotically around each other from the end of inflation until they reach
extremely small values. The average period of preponderance of one of the two
continuously increases in this process. We discuss that this may provide one
clue to a solution of the coincidence problem. For a Mexican hat potential we
can easily obtain and understand dynamical symmetry breaking.

on the basis of the notion of selection criteria to characterize states of
relevance to each specific domain in quantum physics, ranging from the
relativistic quantum fields in the vacuum situations with unbroken and
spontaneously broken internal symmetries, through equilibrium and
non-equilibrium states to some basic aspects in measurement processes. This is
achieved by the help of c-q and q-c channels: the former determines the states
to be selected and to be parametrized by the order parameters, and the latter
provides the physical interpretations of selected states in terms of order
parameters. This formulation extends the traditional range of applicability of
the Doplicher-Roberts construction method for recovering the field algebra and
the gauge group (of the first kind) from the data of group invariant
observables to the situations with spontaneous symmetry breakdown: in use of
the machinery proposed, the physical and mathematical meaning of basic
structural ingredients associated with the spontaneously broken symmetry are
re-examined, such as the degenerate vacua parametrized by the variable
belonging to the relevant homogeneous space, the Goldstone modes and
condensates, etc. The geometrical meaning of the space of order parameters is
naturally understood in relation with the adjunction as the classifying space
of a sector structure. As further examples of applications, some basic notions
arising in the mathematical framework of quantum theory are reformulated and
examined in connection with control theory.

stronger enhancement in the forward rapidity region of the projectile is also
predicted, resulting in a unique rapidity asymmetry of the hadron spectra at
high $p_T$. The shape of the rapidity asymmetry should be reversed for low
$p_T$ hadrons that are dominated by soft and coherent interactions which
suppress hadron spectra in the projectile rapidity region. The phenomenon at
the LHC energies is shown to be qualitatively different because of parton
shadowing.

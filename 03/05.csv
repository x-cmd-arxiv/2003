of DEM L71. We have used both Chandra ACIS-S data and optical Fabry-Perot
spectra of the blast wave to measure the electron and proton temperatures,
respectively. In principle, when combined, these measurements can determine the
degree of electron-ion temperature equilibration (g_0 = T_e/T_p) immediately
behind the shock front. In our X-ray analysis we fit Chandra spectra of three
nested regions behind the blast wave under three different scenarios: (1) a
planar, initially unequilibrated shock (g_0 = m_e/m_p), where the downstream
electron and proton temperatures equilibrate through Coulomb collisions, (2) a
planar, immediately equilibrated shock (g_0 = 1) and (3) a spherical,
equilibrated shock under Sedov evolution. Using independent measurements of T_e
and T_p we find that the X-ray spectra from the fastest blast wave locations
(V_s~700-1000 km/s) are consistent with little or no equilibration at the shock
front and are inconsistent with full equilibration. In contrast, spectra from
regions showing slower blast wave speeds (V_s~400-600 km/s) allow full
equilibration but exclude zero equilibration. In order to directly constrain
the initial equilibration, we incorporated our knowledge of the proton
temperatures into our X-ray models to build planar shock models that allowed
for a variable g_0. This model confirmed and strengthened the above results.
Specifically, we found that X-ray spectra from an intermediate velocity shock
(V_s~800 km/s) were consistent with intermediate equilibration, excluding both
g_0 = m_e/m_p and g_0 = 1 at greater than 1 sigma. Overall, our results support
the picture of decreasing electron-ion equilibration with increasing shock
speed.

on the sum of active neutrino mass eigenstates of \sum m_nu < 1.0 eV (95%
conf.), but this limit is dependent on priors. We find that the WMAP and 2dF
data alone cannot rule out the evidence from neutrinoless double beta decay
reported by the Heidelberg-Moscow experiment. In terms of the relativistic
energy density in neutrinos or other weakly interacting species we find, in
units of the equivalent number of neutrino species, N_nu, that N_nu =
4.0+3.0-2.1 (95% conf.). When BBN constraints are added, the bound on N_\nu is
2.6+0.4-0.3 (95% conf.), suggesting that N_nu could possibly be lower than the
standard model value of 3. This can for instance be the case in models with
very low reheating temperature and incomplete neutrino thermalization.
Conversely, if N_nu is fixed to 3 then the data from WMAP and 2dFGRS predicts
that 0.2458 < Y_P < 0.2471, which is significantly higher than the
observationally measured value. The limit on relativistic energy density
changes when a small $\nu_e$ chemical potential is present during BBN. In this
case the upper bound on N_nu from WMAP, 2dFGRS and BBN is N_nu < 6.5. Finally,
we find that a non-zero \sum m_nu can be compensated by an increase in N_nu.
One result of this is that the LSND result is not yet ruled out by cosmological
observations.

the pulse profiles at different energies simultaneously, corresponding phase

bivariate method which explicitly deals with the Halpha selection of the survey
is used when estimating these functions. Total stellar masses have been
calculated on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis taking into account differences in star
formation histories. The main difference between the luminosity distributions
of the UCM sample and the luminosity functions of the local galaxy population
is a lower normalization (phi^*), indicating a lower global volume density of
UCM galaxies. The typical near-infrared luminosity (L^*) of local star-forming
galaxies is fainter than that of normal galaxies. This is a direct consequence
of the lower stellar masses of our objects. However, at optical wavelengths (B
and r) the luminosity enhancement arising from the young stars leads to M^*
values that are similar to those of normal galaxies. The fraction of the total
optical and near infrared luminosity density in the local Universe associated
with star-forming galaxies is 10-20%. Fitting the total stellar mass function
using a Schechter parametrization we obtain alpha=-1.15+/-0.15,
log({M}^*)=10.82+/-0.17 Msun and log(phi^*)=-3.04+/-0.20 Mpc^{-3}. This gives
an integrated total stellar mass density of 10^{7.83+/-0.07} Msun Mpc^{-3} in
local star-forming galaxies (H_0=70 km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, Omega_M=0.3,
Lambda=0.7). The volume-averaged burst strength of the UCM galaxies is
b=0.04+/-0.01, defined as the ratio of the mass density of stars formed in
recent bursts (age<10 Myr) to the total stellar mass density in UCM galaxies.
Finally, we derive that, in the local Universe, (13+/-3)% of the total baryon
mass density in the form of stars is associated with star-forming galaxies.

oscillations, implying that neutrinos have non-zero mass, but without pinning
down their absolute masses. While it is established that the effect of
neutrinos on the evolution of cosmic structure is small, the upper limits
derived from large-scale structure data could help significantly to constrain
the absolute scale of the neutrino masses. In a recent paper the 2dF Galaxy
Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) team provided an upper limit m_nu,tot < 2.2 eV, i.e.
approximately 0.7 eV for each of the three neutrino flavours, or phrased in
terms of their contributioin to the matter density, Omega_nu/Omega_m < 0.16.
Here we discuss this analysis in greater detail, considering issues of assumed
'priors' like the matter density Omega_m and the bias of the galaxy
distribution with respect the dark matter distribution. As the suppression of
the power spectrum depends on the ratio Omega_nu/Omega_m, we find that the
out-of- fashion Mixed Dark Matter Model, with Omega_nu=0.2, Omega_m=1 and no
cosmological constant, fits the 2dFGRS power spectrum and the CMB data
reasonably well, but only for a Hubble constant H_0<50 km/s/Mpc. As a
consequence, excluding low values of the Hubble constant, e.g. with the HST Key
Project is important in order to get a strong constraint on the neutrino
masses. We also comment on the improved limit by the WMAP team, and point out
that the main neutrino signature comes from the 2dFGRS and the Lyman alpha

more EROs than what is expected from a random distribution. The average surface
density exceeds the value found in large random-field surveys by a factor of

that the quasar lines of sight are biassed towards regions of high ERO density.
This might be caused by clusters or groups of galaxies physically associated
with the quasars. However, an equally likely possibility is that the observed
ERO excess is part of overdensities in the ERO population along the line of

in partially neutral gas. The new spectra of DEM L71 include portions of the
rim that have not been previously observed. We find that the broad component
width varies azimuthally along the edge of DEM L71, ranging from 450+/-60 km/s
along the eastern edge to values as high as 985 (+210)(-165) km/s along the
faint western edge. In part of the faint northern rim the broad component is
not detected, possibly indicating a lower density in these regions and/or a
broad component width in excess of 1000 km/s. Between the limits of zero and
full electron-ion temperature equilibration at the shock front, the allowed
range of shock velocities is 430-560 km/s along the east rim and 700-1250 km/s
along other parts of the blast wave. The H-alpha broad-to-narrow flux ratios
vary considerably around the remnant, ranging from 0.4 to 0.8. These ratios lie
below the values predicted by our shock models. We find that narrow component
H-alpha emission from a cosmic ray precursor may be the cause of the
discrepancy. The least decelerated portions of the blast wave (i.e., regions
excluding the brightest filaments) are well characterized by Sedov models with
a kinetic energy E_51= (0.37+/-0.06)*D_50**(5/2), where D_50 is the LMC

flows onto black holes. We consider magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) accretion flows
with a spherically symmetric density distribution at the outer boundary, but
with spherical symmetry broken by the introduction of a small,
latitude-dependent angular momentum and a weak radial magnetic field. We study
accretion flows by means of numerical 2D, axisymmetric, MHD simulations with
and without resistive heating. Our main result is that the properties of the
accretion flow depend mostly on an equatorial accretion torus which is made of
the material that has too much angular momentum to be accreted directly. The
torus accretes, however, because of the transport of angular momentum due to
the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Initially, accretion is dominated by
the polar funnel, as in the hydrodynamic inviscid case, where material has zero
or very low angular momentum. At the later phase of the evolution, the torus
thickens towards the poles and develops a corona or an outflow or both.
Consequently, the mass accretion through the funnel is stopped. The accretion
of rotating gas through the torus is significantly reduced compared to the
accretion of non-rotating gas (i.e., the Bondi rate). It is also much smaller
than the accretion rate in the inviscid, weakly rotating case.Our results do
not change if we switch on or off resistive heating. Overall our simulations
are very similar to those presented by Stone, Pringle, Hawley and Balbus
despite different initial and outer boundary conditions. Thus, we confirm that
MRI is very robust and controls the nature of radiatively inefficient accretion

equilibrium and maintains energy balance between radiative cooling and heating
by thermal conduction. We analyze the thermal stability of the gas using a
Lagrangian perturbation analysis. For thermal conductivity at the level of
20-40 % of Spitzer conductivity, consistent with previous estimates for cluster
gas, we find that the growth rate of the most unstable global radial mode is ~
6-9 times lower than the growth rate of local isobaric modes at the cluster
center in the absence of conduction. The growth time in typical clusters is ~
2-5 Gyr, which is comparable to the time since the last major merger episode,
when the gas was presumably well mixed. Thus, we suggest that thermal
instability is not dynamically significant in clusters, provided there is an
adequate level of thermal conduction. On the other hand, if the heating of the
gas is not the result of thermal conduction or any other diffusive process such
as turbulent mixing, then the thermal instability has a growth time under a Gyr
in the central regions of the cluster and is a serious threat to equilibrium.
We also analyze local nonradial modes and show that the Lagrangian technique
leads to the same dispersion relation as the Eulerian approach, provided that
clusters are initially in strict thermal equilibrium. Because cluster gas is
convectively stable, nonradial modes always have a smaller growth rate than
equivalent radial modes.

The distance of NGC 5253 has been rediscussed. The mean distance of (m-M)_0 =

of (m-M)_0 = 28.28 +/- 0.10 (4.5 +/- 0.2 Mpc) together with its mean recession

flow line of the velocity-distance relation (with H_0 ~ 60) with no significant
deviation, supporting the earlier conclusion that the local velocity expansion
field is remarkably cold on a scale of 10 Mpc, contrary to the predictions of
the simplest cold dark matter model for large scale structure. The role of a
cosmological constant has been invoked as a possible solution in providing a
nearly uniform force field everywhere in the presence of a lumpy galaxy
distribution. (abridged)

multi-phase medium is seen in all three systems, consistent with smaller,
denser clouds producing low-ionization transitions (MgII, FeII, and SiII) and
larger, diffuse clouds giving rise to high-ionization transitions (CIV, NV,

requires a super-solar metallicity in both low- and high-ionization phases,
unless an alpha-group enhancement is included. With the unusually complex
velocity structure resolved in the NV profiles, this system is unlikely to
represent a traditional galaxy disk/corona. The most likely candidate host
galaxy is a ~2L^*, apparently warped, spiral at an impact parameter of 43h^-1
kpc. (2) System B, at z=0.9276, has the strongest MgII absorption and has an
approximately solar metallicity in the low-ionization phase. The smooth, broad
high-ionization profiles may indicate a coronal structure similar to that of
the Milky Way. The redshift of an L^* galaxy (z=0.9289), at an impact parameter
of 38h^-1 kpc is consistent with the redshift of this system. (3) System C, at
z=0.9342, has a single component in MgII, separated from the other two systems
by ~1000km/s. It lacks the small, low-ionization cloud characteristic of an
isolated single-cloud, weak MgII absorber. Its absorption properties are
similar to the ``satellite clouds'' of classic strong MgII absorbers, so this
could be a high-velocity cloud in the galaxy group responsible for the systems,

describe the pseudo-Newtonian potential for accretion disk around black hole,
the Hartle-Thorne metric is considered to describe disk around neutron star.
Two other potentials were proposed to describe the temporal effects of the
accretion disk. Using these potentials, I study the global parameter space of
the accretion disk around black holes and neutron stars. I show that, for
different angular momenta of the compact object, the valid disk parameter
region dramatically changes and disk may become unstable in certain situations.
To bring it in the stable situation, the angular momentum of the accreting
matter has to be reduced/enhanced (for co/counter-rotating disk) by means of
some physical process. I also study, how the fluid properties get changed with
different rotations of the compact objects. Moreover, I show the effect of
viscosity to the fluid properties of the disk. Thus, I find out the unified
physical parameter regime, for which the stable accretion disk can be formed.

driven by non-relativistic matter and an exotic fluid (quintessence) with an
equation of state: $p_{Q}=w\rho_{Q}$ ($-1\le w<0$), we investigate whether or
not the large scale dynamical effects regarding the cluster formation and
virialization are related to the cosmic equation of state. Using the non-linear
spherical collapse we find that the cluster formation rate, in quintessence
models, is intermediate between the open and $\Lambda$CDM respectively. For the
QCDM case, using the virial theorem and energy conservation and assuming a
spherical mass overdensity shell, we obtain analytically the ratio between the
final (virial) and the turn-around radius. We find that the above ratio is
almost independent from the equation of state.

Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) that populate the Kuiper Belt. The TNO binaries
are strikingly different from asteroid binaries in four respects (Veillet et al
2002): their frequency is an order of magnitude larger, the mass ratio of their
components is closer to unity, and their orbits are wider and highly eccentric.
Two explanations have been proposed for their formation, one assuming large
numbers of massive bodies (Weidenschilling 2002), and one assuming large
numbers of light bodies (Goldreich et al 2002). We argue that both assumptions
are unwarranted, and we show how TNO binaries can be produced from a modest
number of intermediate-mass bodies of the type predicted by the gravitational
instability theory for the formation of planetesimals (Goldreich and Ward
1973). We start with a TNO binary population similar to the asteroid binary
population, but subsequently modified by three-body exchange reactions, a
process that is far more efficient in the Kuiper belt, because of the much
smaller tidal perturbations by the Sun. Our mechanism can naturally account for
all four characteristics that distinguish TNO binaries from main-belt asteroid
binaries.

This emission either arises from a two component disc, one circumstellar and

an unrelated background object. The other two detections we attribute to
circumsecondary discs with masses of 0.04 and 0.3Mearth; a circumprimary disc

showed evidence for dust emission at 25um and 60um toward one star (HD1438);
none of the sub-mm detections were evident in the far-IR data implying that
these discs are cold (<40K assuming beta=1). Our sub-mm detections are some of
the first of dust discs surrounding evolved stars that were not detected by
IRAS or ISO and imply that 9-14% of stars could harbour previously undetected
dust discs that await discovery in unbiased sub-mm surveys. If these discs are
protoplanetary remnants, rather than secondary debris discs, dust lifetime
arguments show that they must be devoid of small <0.1mm grains. Thus it may be
possible to determine the origin of these discs from their spectral energy
distributions. The low dust masses for this sample support the picture that
protoplanetary dust discs are depleted to the levels of the brightest debris

dust and by the fine structure lines of high excitation potential ions (NII,

line emission has revealed a very extended component of ionized gas. The study
of the NIII 57 microns/NII 122 microns and OIII 52/88 microns line intensity
ratios show that the ionized gas has a density of n_e~10^{2-3} cm^-3 while the
ionizing radiation can be characterized by a diluted but hard continuum, with
effective temperatures of ~35000 K.
  Photoionization models show that the total number of Lyman photons needed to
explain such an extended component is approximately equal to that of the HII
regions in Sgr B2(N) and (M) condensations. We propose that the inhomogeneous
and clumpy structure of the cloud allows the radiation to reach large distances
through the envelope. Therefore, photodissociation regions (PDRs) can be
numerous at the interface of the ionized and the neutral gas. The analysis of
the OI (63 and 145 microns) and CII (158 microns) lines indicates an incident
far-UV field (G_0, in units of the local interstellar radiation field) of
10^{3-4} and a H density of 10^{3-4} cm^{-3} in such PDRs. We conclude that
extended photoionization and photodissociation are also taking place in Sgr B2

probability for erasing the immediately preceding part of the worm, when adding
a new part,is minimal. We introduce a simple numerical procedure for minimizing
this probability. The procedure only depends on appropriately defined local
probabilities and should be generally applicable. Furthermore we show how
correlation functions, C(r,tau) can be straightforwardly obtained from the

classical inertial spins with infinite-range interactions which shows a second
order phase transition. In order to understand the origin of metastability,
which appears in an energy region below the critical point, we consider two
different classes of out-of-equilibrium initial conditions, both leading to
QSS, and having respectively initial magnetization equal to one (M1 IC) and
equal to zero (M0 IC). We compare the corresponding $\mu$-space, the resulting
velocity pdfs and correlations, and the eventual aging features of the
microscopic dynamics. In both cases the model exhibits non-gaussian pdfs,
though anomalous correlations are present only when the system is started with
an initial magnetization equal to one. In the M0 IC case the relaxation to
equilibrium is almost exponential, while,for M1 IC, when correlations and aging
are found, the decay is a power-law and the overall behavior can be very well
reproduced by a Tsallis q-exponential function. These results contribute to
clarify the overall scenario, which is more complex than previously expected
and stress the importance of the dynamics in the relaxation process. The
nonextensive statistical mechanics formalism proposed by Tsallis seems to be
valid, in the out-of-equilibrium phase, when correlations and strong long-term
memory effects emerge. This regime becomes stable if the $N\to \infty $ limit
is performed before the $t\to \infty $ limit.

crucial. With information on important higher order couplings constrained from
analyses of inelastic pion production processes, a chiral extrapolation

  eq. (8.4)","Phys.Rev.D69:016002,2004","10.1103/PhysRevD.69.016002",,"hep-ph hep-th",,"  We show that an exact non-perturbative quantization of continuum gauge theory

\det[-\p \cdot D(A)] \exp[-S_{\rm YM}(A)]$, restricted to the region where the
Faddeev-Popov operator is positive $-\p \cdot D(A) > 0$ (Gribov region).
Although there are Gribov copies inside this region, they have no influence on
expectation-values. The starting point of the derivation is stochastic
quantization which determines the Euclidean probability distribution $P(A)$ by
a method that is free of the Gribov critique. In the Landau-gauge limit the
support of $P(A)$ shrinks down to the Gribov region with Faddeev-Popov weight.
The cut-off of the resulting functional integral on the boundary of the Gribov
region does not change the {\it form} of the Dyson-Schwinger equations, because
$\det[-\p \cdot D(A)]$ vanishes on the boundary, so there is no boundary
contribution. However this cut-off does provide {\it supplementary conditions}
that govern the choice of solution of the DS equations. In particular the
""horizon condition"", though consistent with the perturbative renormalization
group, puts QCD into a non-perturbative phase. The infrared asymptotic limit of
the DS equations of QCD is obtained by neglecting the Yang-Mills action $S_{\rm
YM}$. We sketch the extension to a BRST-invariant formulation. In the infrared
asymptotic limit, the BRST-invariant action becomes BRST-exact, and defines a
topological quantum field theory with an infinite mass gap. Confinement of

due to the pairing. The theoretical methods borrowed from macroscopic
superconductivity turn out to be insufficient for finite systems as nuclei, in

An information theoretic perspective","26 pages, 10 figures, added explanatory material and examples",,,,"physics.data-an physics.gen-ph",,"  Clustering provides a common means of identifying structure in complex data,
and there is renewed interest in clustering as a tool for the analysis of large
data sets in many fields. A natural question is how many clusters are
appropriate for the description of a given system. Traditional approaches to
this problem are based either on a framework in which clusters of a particular
shape are assumed as a model of the system or on a two-step procedure in which
a clustering criterion determines the optimal assignments for a given number of
clusters and a separate criterion measures the goodness of the classification
to determine the number of clusters. In a statistical mechanics approach,
clustering can be seen as a trade--off between energy-- and entropy--like
terms, with lower temperature driving the proliferation of clusters to provide
a more detailed description of the data. For finite data sets, we expect that
there is a limit to the meaningful structure that can be resolved and therefore
a minimum temperature beyond which we will capture sampling noise. This
suggests that correcting the clustering criterion for the bias which arises due
to sampling errors will allow us to find a clustering solution at a temperature
which is optimal in the sense that we capture maximal meaningful structure --
without having to define an external criterion for the goodness or stability of
the clustering. We show that, in a general information theoretic framework, the
finite size of a data set determines an optimal temperature, and we introduce a
method for finding the maximal number of clusters which can be resolved from
the data in the hard clustering limit.

which includes a transverse Lorentz force, leading to equilibrium.

make their presence felt explictly in nuclei only at higher energies. However
it is shown here that the hole in the centre of $ ^{3}H $, $ ^{3}He $ and $

effects in nuclei and the nuclear molecules all basically arise due to the same
underlying quark effects. Also the role of triton clustering in very neutron
rich nuclei is emphasized. These require the concept of hidden colour states
which arise from the confinement ideas of QCD for the multi-quark systems.

profile in binary fluids under shear during spinodal decomposition. In simple
fluids, when a shear flow is applied on the boundaries of the system, the time
required to obtain a triangular profile is inversely proportional to the
viscosity and proportional to the square of the size of the system. We find
that the same behaviour also occurs for binary mixtures, for any component
ratio in the mixture and independently from the time when shear flow is
switched on during phase separation.

form. The connection of this procedure with that of estimating unitary

Three-dimensional input-output relations are derived for both amplitude

space. The conditions are discussed, under which the input-output relations can
be expressed in terms of bosonic operators. The theory applies to both
(effectively) free fields and fields, created by active atomic sources inside

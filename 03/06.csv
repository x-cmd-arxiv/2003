with medium-sized dedicated zenith telescopes rather than large steerable
telescopes, freeing the later to carry out projects that truly need them. I
show that the large number of objects observed with a surveying 4-m zenith
telescope allows one to carry out cosmological projects at low redshifts.
Examining two case studies, I show first that a variability survey would obtain
light curves for several thousands of type Ia supernovae per year up to z=1 and
easily discriminate among competing cosmological models. Finally, I discuss a
second case study, consisting of a spectrophotometric survey carried out with
interference filters, showing its power to discriminate among cosmological
models and to study the large-scale distribution of galaxies in the Universe.

metals and raise its temperature to a high adiabat, and so inhibit the
formation of early galaxies. We compute the thermal history of the IGM when it
experiences a period of rapid, homogeneous ""preheating"" at high redshifts.
Measurements of the temperature of the Lyamn-alpha forest at z~3 constrain the
redshift and energy of preheating, and rule out models that preheat too late or
to too high a temperature. We predict galaxy luminosity functions in preheated
universes. The results depend crucially on whether the baryonic smoothing scale
in the IGM is computed globally, or in a local, density-dependent fashion.
Using a globally averaged smoothing scale, we find that models with excessive
preheating produce too few L_* and fainter galaxies, and are therefore
inconsistent with observational data. A density-dependent smoothing scale
requires more energetic preheating to achieve the same degree of suppression in
the faint-end slope. All models, however, appear unable to explain the sharp
cut-off in the luminosity function at bright magnitudes. Supernova-driven
preheating scenarios tend to raise the mean metallicity of the universe well
above the minimum levels observed in the Lyman-alpha clouds. We find that
ionizing photon escape fractions must be significantly higher than 10% in order
to explain the low inferred HI fraction at z~6. While early preheating causes
strong suppression of dwarf galaxy formation we show that it is not able to
reproduce the observed abundance of satellite galaxies in the Local Group in
detail.

component (B) is blue, the other (P) is red in restframe UV-optical colours.
The combined system has an optical luminosity of ~8L* and its restframe optical
spectrum is characteristic of a Seyfert AGN. However, its restframe UV spectrum
exhibits striking features associated with young stars, including P-Cygni lines
from stellar winds and blue-shifted interstellar absorption lines indicative of
a galactic outflow. Redshifts are derived from stellar photospheric lines in
the UV and from narrow emission lines in the restframe optical, and these are
compared to that measured for the molecular gas recently detected with the IRAM
interferometer. The offsets indicate that the far-IR emission is most likely
associated with the near-IR source P, which hosts the Seyfert nucleus, while
the UV-bright component B is blueshifted by 400km/s. This suggests that the two
components are probably merging and the resulting gravitational interactions
have triggered the hyperluminous activity. Modelling of the UV spectral
features implies that the starburst within the UV component of this system has
been going on for at least ~10Myrs. Assuming that the bolometrically-dominant
obscured component has a similar lifetime, we estimate that it has so far
formed a total stellar mass of ~10^11 Mo. If this star formation continues at
its present level for substantially longer, or if this activity is repeated,

centers, and some are known to possess supermassive black holes (SBHs) and
their associated stellar cusps. Previous theoretical work has suggested that a
bar in a galaxy could be dissolved by the formation of a mass concentration in
the center, although the precise mass and degree of central concentration
required is not well-established. Here we report an extensive study of the
effects of central masses on bars in high-quality N-body simulations of
galaxies. We study models containing both strong and weak bars, and quantify
the change in bar amplitude as a mass concentration is grown in their centers.
We find that bars are more robust than previously thought. We have varied the
growth rate of the central mass, its final mass and the degree of concentration
of the mass. Our main conclusions are: (1) the central mass has to be as large
as several percent of the disk mass to completely destroy the bar; (2) for a
given mass, objects whose scale-length is a few pc or less cause the greatest
reduction in bar amplitude, while significantly more diffuse objects have a
lesser effect; and (3) the bar amplitude always decreases as the central mass
is grown, and continues to decay thereafter on a cosmological timescale. Thus
the masses of SBHs are probably too small, even when dressed with a stellar
cusp, to affect the bar amplitude significantly.

time and the ``norm-leakage'' decay function is found. Fluctuations above the
average at large values of delay times are strongly suppressed by absorption.
The relation of the time-delay matrix to the reflection matrix S^{\dagger}S is
established at arbitrary absorption that gives us the distribution of
reflection eigenvalues. The particular case of single-channel scattering is
explicitly considered in detail.

which separates hard (order 2 pi T) and soft (order gT) contributions, we
explore the accuracy of simple resummations which at a given loop order
systematically treat hard contributions strictly perturbatively, but soft
contributions without truncations. This turns out to improve significantly the
two-loop and the three-loop results in that both remain below the ideal-gas
value, and the degree of renormalization scale dependence decreases as one goes
from two to three loop order, whereas it increases in the conventional
perturbative results. Including the four-loop logarithms recently obtained by
Kajantie et al., we find that this trend continues and that with a particular
sublogarithmic constant the untruncated four-loop result is close to the
three-loop result, which itself agrees well with available lattice results down
to temperatures of about 2.5 T_c. We also investigate the possibility of
optimization by using a variational (``screened'') perturbation theory in the
effective theory. At two loops, this gives a result below the ideal gas value,
and also closer to lattice results than the recent two-loop
hard-thermal-loop-screened result of Andersen et al. While at three-loop order
the gap equation of dimensionally reduced screened perturbation theory does not
have a solution in QCD, this is remedied upon inclusion of the four-loop
logarithms.

Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on the time direction. SD-brane
physics is inherently time-dependent. Previous investigations of gravity fields
of SD-branes have yielded undesirable naked spacelike singularities. We set up
the problem of coupling the most relevant open-string tachyonic mode to
massless closed-string modes in the bulk, with backreaction and Ramond-Ramond
fields included. We find solutions numerically in a self-consistent
approximation; our solutions are naturally asymptotically flat and
time-reversal asymmetric. We find completely nonsingular evolution; in
particular, the dilaton and curvature are well-behaved for all time. The
essential mechanism for spacetime singularity resolution is the inclusion of
full backreaction between the bulk fields and the rolling tachyon. Our analysis
is not the final word on the story, because we have to make some significant
approximations, most notably homogeneity of the tachyon on the unstable branes.
Nonetheless, we provide significant progress in plugging a gaping hole in prior
understanding of the gravity fields of SD-branes.

  nonrelativistic limit",,,,,"math.AP",,"  We deal with the ``nonrelativistic limit'', i.e. the limit c to infinity,
where c is the speed of light, of the nonlinear PDE system obtained by coupling
the Dirac equation for a 4-spinor to the Maxwell equations for the
self-consistent field created by the ``moving charge'' of the spinor. This
limit, sometimes also called ``Post-Newtonian'' limit, yields a
Schroedinger-Poisson system, where the spin and the magnetic field no longer
appear. However, our splitting of the 4-spinor into two 2-spinors preserves the
symmetry of ""electrons'' and ""positrons''; the latter obeying a Schroedinger
equation with ``negative mass'' in the limit.
  We rigorously prove that in the nonrelativistic limit solutions of the
Dirac-Maxwell system converge in the energy space $C([0,T];H^{1})$ to solutions
of a Schroedinger-Poisson system, under appropriate (convergence) conditions on
the initial data.
  We also prove that the time interval of existence of local solutions of
Dirac-Maxwell is bounded from below by log(c). In fact, for this result we only
require uniform $H^{1}$ bounds on the initial data, not convergence.
  Our key technique is ""null form estimates'', extending the work of Klainerman
and Machedon and our previous work on the nonrelativistic limit of the
Klein-Gordon-Maxwell system.

efficient way of generating, mechanically and with little effort, myriads of
relatively simple face-pairing descriptions of interesting closed 3-manifolds.
The corresponding description in terms of surgery, or Dehn-filling, reveals the
twist construction as a carefully organized surgery on a link.
  In this paper, we work out the relationship between the twisted face-pairing
description of closed 3-manifolds and the more common descriptions by surgery
and Heegaard diagrams. We show that all Heegaard diagrams have a natural
decomposition into subdiagrams called Heegaard cylinders, each of which has a
natural shape given by the ratio of two positive integers. We characterize the
Heegaard diagrams arising naturally from a twisted face-pairing description as
those whose Heegaard cylinders all have integral shape. This characterization
allows us to use the Kirby calculus and standard tools of Heegaard theory to
attack the problem of finding which closed, orientable 3-manifolds have a
twisted face-pairing description.

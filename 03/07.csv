interpret the double-peaked lines as arising from optically thick,

analytically two filters for the PLANCK point source extraction, namely, the

also apply the ATHF on the WMAP Q-band map and the derived map (the

efficiency of the TOF. To tackle the real situations for the PLANCK point

skewed iron K alpha emission lines from several accreting black hole systems.
The lines are assumed to be due to fluorescence of the accretion disk
illuminated by a surrounding corona and require a steep emissivity profile
increasing in to the innermost radius. This appears to question both standard
accretion disc theory and the zero torque assumption for the inner boundary
condition, both of which predict a much less extreme profile. Instead it argues
that a torque may be present due to magnetic coupling with matter in the
plunging region or even to the spinning black hole itself. Discussion so far
has centered on the torque acting on the disc. However the crucial determinant
of the iron line profile is the radial variation of the power radiated in the
corona. Here we study the effects of different inner boundary conditions on the
coronal emissivity and on the profiles of the observable Fe K alpha lines. We
argue that in the extreme case where a prominent highly redshifted component of
the iron line is detected, requiring a steep emissivity profile in the
innermost part and a flatter one outside, energy from the gas plunging into the
black hole is being fed directly to the corona.

modulated on the primary's spin period and harmonics of the positive superhump
period, with an amplitude peak-to-peak of almost ~10 per cent with both
negative and positive polarization. A recent study by Woudt & Warner of RR Cha
shows it to have both positive and negative superhumps, indicating the presence
of a precessing/tilted accretion disc. In addition, they also find a stable
period at 1950 s, characteristic of an Intermediate Polar. RR Cha also shows
deep eclipses with variable depth. We propose a possible explanation for the
origin of the polarized emission. We assume that it is of cyclotron origin. The
variations of the circular polarization with the proposed spin period are
caused by the rotation of the compact object. The long period variability arise
as a result of a precessing/tilted accretion disc, periodically obscuring
either of two accretion regions on the surface of the white dwarf. We also
point out several similarities of RR Cha with the SW Sex stars. The lack of a
time resolved spectroscopic study prevents to make any conclusion regarding its
possible SW Sex nature. Hence, such spectroscopic study is encouraged. RR Cha
is the second old nova exhibiting variable circular polarization and we
therefore encourage polarimetric observations of other nova remnants.

line from hydrogenic Fe. We show that Fe is present above the photosphere as
long as $\dot M>4\times 10^{-13}M_\odot {\rm yr^{-1}}$ during the burst. In
this limit, the total Fe column is $N_{\rm Fe}\approx 3\times 10^{19}{\rm

nuclear physics of the proton spallation. The Fe destruction creates many heavy
elements with $Z<26$ which may imprint photo-ionization edges on the NS spectra
during a radius expansion event or in a burst cooling tail. Detecting these
features in concert with those from Fe would confirm a redshift measurement. We
also begin to address the radiative transfer problem, and find that a

X-rays in the interstellar medium. However, the direct images of bright sources
obtained with ACIS usually suffer from severe pile-up. Making use of the fact
that an isotropic image could be reconstructed from its projection into any

obtained with the HETGS and/or in CC mode. These data have no or less serious
pile-up and enable us to take full advantage of the excellent angular

significant steps forward have been taken in building the case for a
supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way and understanding the
black hole's effect on its environment. Using adaptive optics and speckle
imaging to study the motions of stars in the plane of sky with +-~2 mas
precision over the past 7 years, we have obtained the first simultaneous
orbital solution for multiple stars. Among the included stars, three are newly
identified (S0-16, S0-19, S0-20). The most dramatic orbit is that of the newly
identified star S0-16, which passed a mere 60 AU from the central dark mass at
a velocity of 9,000 km/s in 1999. The orbital analysis results in a new central
dark mass estimate of 3.6(+-0.4)x10^6(D/8kpc)^3 Mo. This dramatically
strengthens the case for a black hole at the center of our Galaxy, by confining
the dark matter to within a radius of 0.0003 pc or 1,000 Rsh and thereby
increasing the inferred dark mass density by four orders of magnitude compared
to earlier estimates.
  With the introduction of an adaptive-optics-fed spectrometer, we have
obtained the spectra of these high-velocity stars, which suggest that they are
massive (~15 Mo), young (<10 Myr) main sequence stars. This presents a major
challenge to star formation theories, given the strong tidal forces that
prevail over all distances reached by these stars in their current orbits and
the difficulty in migrating these stars inward during their lifetime from
further out where tidal forces should no longer preclude star formation.

to probe the variations in the energy of blast-wave with time. We present a
general formalism that reduces the calculation of the observed light curve from
a Blandford-Mackee blast-wave to the evaluation of a one dimensional integral.
Using this formalism we obtain a simple approximation to the general light
curve that arises in more complex situations where the afterglow's energy or
the external density vary. The solution is valid for spherically symmetric
profiles and it takes a full consideration of the angular time delay effects.
We present the light curves of several external density profiles and
demonstrate the effects of density variations on the light curve. We also
re-visit the afterglow of GRB021004 and we find that the steep decay after the
first bump ($\sim 4000sec$) cannot result from a spherically symmetric density
variation or from the passage of the synchrotron frequency through the optical
band. This suggests that an angular structure is responsible to some of the
observed features in the light curve. This may be the first evidence that an
angular structure is important in the early stages of the afterglow.

jets discovered with Chandra likely implies that jets (at least in powerful
quasars) are still relativistic at that distances from the active nucleus. In
this case the emission is due to Compton scattering off seed photons provided
by the Cosmic Microwave Background, and this on one hand permits to have
magnetic fields close to equipartition with the emitting particles, and on the
other hand minimizes the requirements about the total power carried by the jet.
The emission comes from compact (kpc scale) knots, and we here investigate what
we can predict about the possible emission between the bright knots. This is
motivated by the fact that bulk relativistic motion makes Compton scattering
off the CMB photons efficient even when electrons are cold or mildly
relativistic in the comoving frame. This implies relatively long cooling times,
dominated by adiabatic losses. Therefore the relativistically moving plasma can
emit, by Compton scattering the microwave seed photons, for a long time. We
discuss how the existing radio--to--X-ray observations of large scale jets
already pose strong constraints on the structure and dynamics of knots and we
present a scenario that can satisfactorily reproduce the observed phenomenology
of the jet in 3C273. In this scenario the kiloparsec-scale knots visible with
HST, Chandra and VLA are composed of several smaller sub--units, accounting for
the fast decrease of the flux outside the large knot. Substructure in the
X-ray- emitting knots can also explain the month--year variability timescale
reported for the large scale jet in M87.

with redshifts above 2. When applied to our dataset, we find 14 galaxies with
Ks < 22.5, corresponding to a surface density of 3+-0.8 /arcmin**2. The
photometric redshifts all lie above 1.9, with a median of 2.6 and a rms of 0.7.
The spectral energy distributions of these galaxies show a wide range: one is
very blue in the rest-frame UV, and satisfies the normal Lyman-break criteria
for high redshift, star-forming galaxies. Others are quite red throughout the
observed spectral range, and are extremely faint in the optical, with a median
V = 26.6. Hence these galaxies would not be included in photometric samples
based on optical ground-based data, and spectroscopic follow-up is difficult.
The spectral energy distributions often show a prominent break, identified as
the Balmer break or 4000 Ang. break. The median age is 1 Gyr when fit with a
constant star formation model with dust, or 0.7 Gyr when fit with a single
burst model. Although significantly younger ages cannot be excluded when a
larger range of models is allowed, the results indicate that these galaxies are
among the oldest at these redshifts. The volume density to Ks=22.5 is half that
of Lyman-break galaxies at z = 3. Since the mass-to-light ratios of the red
galaxies are likely to be higher, the stellar mass density is inferred to be
comparable to that of Lyman-break galaxies. These red galaxies may be the
descendants of galaxies which started to form stars at very high redshifts, and
they may evolve into the most massive galaxies at low redshift.

by Voshchinnikov & Mathis (1999), is further developed. Heterogeneous scatteres
are represented by particles with very large number of shells, each including a
homogeneous layer per material considered (amorphous carbon, astronomical
silicate and vacuum).
  The applicability of the effective medium theory (EMT) mostly utilized
earlier to approximate inhomogeneous interstellar grains is examined on the
basis of the new model.
  It is shown that the EMT rules generally have an accuracy of several percent
in the whole range of particle sizes provided the porosity does not exceed
about 50%.
  For larger porosity, the EMT rules give wrong results.
  Using the model, we reanalyze various basic features of cosmic dust --
interstellar extinction, scattered radiation, infrared radiation, radiation
pressure, etc. As an example of the potential of the model, it is applied to
reproduce the extinction curves in the directions to $\zeta$ Oph and $\sigma$
Sco using subsolar cosmic abundances. We also conclude that metallic iron even

at a level comparable to the measurements at K~19. The redshift distribution of
K<24 galaxies extends to z_phot~4-5, and ~40% of the galaxies are at
z_phot>2.At the highest redshifts, 2<z_phot<4, galaxies selected in the rest
frame optical (K-band) appear more clustered than those selected in the rest
frame UV (i.e. Lyman Break Galaxies, LBGs). Galaxy clustering depends on the
J-K color at 2<z_phot<4. K-selected galaxies with J-K>1.7 reach r_0~8 h^-1 Mpc
comoving. This is a factor of 3--4 higher than the correlation length of LBGs
with similar number densities, down to V_606<27, and is also larger than the
correlation length of galaxies with blue J-K<1.7 colors. Hence at z about 3 a
color-density relation is observed which is similar to that observed locally.
Fluctuations in the amplitude of clustering due to cosmic variance may affect
our estimates derived from the small HDF-S field, but these are unlikely to
change our main conclusions. The galaxies with red J-K>1.7 colors at 2<z_phot<4
are likely older and more massive galaxies, on average, than LBGs. They were
presumably formed in the highest density perturbations at early epochs.
Semi-analytical hierarchical models do predict the existence of strongly
clustered populations at z~3, but with at least a factor of 10 lower number
density than the one measured. The overall properties of this strongly
clustered population consistently suggest that they are the progenitors, or
building blocks, of local massive early-type galaxies and z~1 EROs, close to
their major epochs of formation.

different redshift distributions of the two samples. Although there will be
some overlap between the two populations, most 'optical-break' galaxies are too
faint in the rest-frame ultraviolet to be selected as Lyman-break galaxies. The
most straightforward interpretation is that star formation in typical

fields in the shape of elongated corridors in which the size and spacing
between dunes are rather well selected. We show that even very realistic models
for solitary dunes do not reproduce these corridors. Instead, two instabilities
take place. First, barchans receive a sand flux at their back proportional to
their width while the sand escapes only from their horns. Large dunes
proportionally capture more than they loose sand, while the situation is
reversed for small ones: therefore, solitary dunes cannot remain in a steady
state. Second, the propagation speed of dunes decreases with the size of the
dune: this leads -- through the collision process -- to a coarsening of barchan
fields. We show that these phenomena are not specific to the model, but result
from general and robust mechanisms. The length scales needed for these
instabilities to develop are derived and discussed. They turn out to be much
smaller than the dune field length. As a conclusion, there should exist further
- yet unknown - mechanisms regulating and selecting the size of dunes.

of gelatin gels on glass. At low driving velocities, sliding occurs via
propagation of periodic self-healing slip pulses whose velocity is limited by
collective diffusion of the gel network. Healing can be attributed to a
frictional instability occurring at the slip velocity $v = V_c$. For $v > V_c$,
sliding is homogeneous and friction is ruled by the shear-thinning rheology of
an interfacial layer of thickness of order the (nanometric) mesh size,
containing a semi-dilute solution of polymer chain ends hanging from the
network. Inspite of its high degree of confinement, the rheology of this system
does not differ qualitatively from known bulk ones. The observed ageing of the
static friction threshold reveals the slow increase of adhesive bonding between
chain ends and glass. Such structural ageing is compatible with the existence
of a velocity-weakening regime at velocities smaller than $V_c$, hence with the
existence of the healing instability.

directly as appropriate pairs consisting of a (perhaps empty) future set and a
(perhaps empty) past set. These future and past sets are just the future and
past of the ideal point within the original spacetime. This provides our
construction with useful causal properties and leads to more satisfactory
results in a number of examples. We are also able to endow the completion with

discrete path integral quantizations of the Plebanski action. However, their
derivation in present formulations is incomplete and lower dimensional simplex
amplitudes are left open to choice. Since their large-spin behavior determines
the convergence properties of the state-sum, this gap has to be closed before
any reliable conclusion about finiteness can be reached. It is shown that these
amplitudes are directly related to the path integral measure and can in
principle be derived from it, requiring detailed knowledge of the constraint
algebra and gauge fixing. In a related manner, minimal requirements of
background independence provide non trivial restrictions on the form of an
anomaly free measure. Many models in the literature do not satisfy these
requirements. A simple model satisfying the above consistency requirements is
presented which can be thought of as a spin foam quantization of the
Husain--Kuchar model.

production in diffractive DIS developed within the k_t-factorization formalism.
Since the k_t-factorization scheme does not require large values of Q^2+m_V^2,
we conduct an analysis that is applicable to all values of Q^2 from photo- up
to highly virtual production of vector mesons. The basic quantity in this
approach -- the unintegrated gluon structure function -- was for the first time
extracted from the experimental data on F_{2p}, thoroughly investigated, and
consistently used in the vector meson production calculation. Moreover, by
limiting ourselves to the lowest Fock state of the vector meson, we were able
to construct in a closed form the theory of spin-angular coupling in the vector
meson. This allowed us for the first time to address the production of a vector
meson in a given spin-angular state. We performed an extensive analytical and
numerical investigation of the properties of 1S, 2S, and D-wave vector meson
production reactions. Treating the physical ground state vector mesons as
purely 1S states, we observed a good overall agreement with all available
experimental data on vector meson production. For the excited states, our
analysis predicts a picture which is remarkably different from 1S-state, so
that such reactions can be regarded as potential sources of new information on
the structure of excited states in vector mesons.

extensions suffer from considerable hadronic uncertainties present in the
B_{s,d}-meson decay constants F_{B_{s,d}} that enter these quantities
quadratically. We point out that in the restricted class of models with minimal
flavour violation (MFV) in which only the SM low energy operators are relevant,
the ratios Br(B_{q}\to\mu\bar\mu)/\Delta M_q (q=s,d) do not depend on F_{B_{q}}
and the CKM matrix elements. They involve in addition to the short distance
functions and B-meson lifetimes only the non-perturbative parameters \hat
B_{s,d}. The latter are under much better control than F_{B_{s,d}}.
Consequently in these models the predictions for Br(B_{q}\to\mu\bar\mu) have
only small hadronic uncertainties once \Delta M_q are experimentally known. Of
particular interest is also the relation
Br(B_{s}\to\mu\bar\mu)/Br(B_{d}\to\mu\bar\mu)=\hat B_{d}/\hat B_{s}
\tau(B_{s})/\tau(B_{d}) \Delta M_{s}/\Delta M_{d} that is practically free of
theoretical uncertainties as \hat B_{s}/\hat B_{d}=1 up to small SU(3) breaking
corrections. Using these ideas within the SM we find much more accurate
predictions than those found in the literature: Br(B_{s}\to\mu\bar\mu)=(3.4\pm

given by the tension of ``BPS core'' plus contribution coming from the

fundamental matter (quarks) with the same mass. We perturb this theory by the
mass term for the adjoint field which to the leading order in perturbation
parameter do not break N=2 supersymmetry and reduces to FI term. The Higgs
branch has Eguchi-Hanson geometry. We work out string solution in the generic

derive, for pure scalar states, the two-loop structure of the dilatation
operator. This allows us to obtain a host of new results. Among these are an
infinite number of previously unknown two-loop anomalous dimensions, new
subtleties concerning 't Hooft's large N expansion due to mixing effects of
degenerate single and multiple trace states, two-loop tests of various
protected operators, as well as two-loop non-planar results for two-impurity
operators in BMN gauge theory. We also put to use the recently discovered
integrable spin chain description of the planar one-loop dilatation operator
and show that the associated Yang-Baxter equation explains the existence of a
hitherto unknown planar ``axial'' symmetry between infinitely many gauge theory
states. We present evidence that this integrability can be extended to all
loops, with intriguing consequences for gauge theory, and that it leads to a
novel integrable deformation of the XXX Heisenberg spin chain. Assuming that
the integrability structure extends to more than two loops, we determine the
planar three-loop contribution to the dilatation operator.

data to a slow manifold, ${\cal M}$, removes fast gravity waves from the
initial state for numerical simulations of the atmosphere. We explore further
the slow manifold for a simple atmospheric model introduced by Lorenz and
anticipate that our results will relevant to the vastly more detailed dynamics
of atmospheres and oceans. Within the dynamics of the Lorenz model, we make
clear the relation between a slow manifold $\cal M$ and the ``slowest invariant
manifold'' ({\SIM}), which was constructed by Lorenz in order to avoid the
divergence of approximation schemes for $\cal M$. These manifolds are shown to
be identical to within exponentially small terms, and so the {\SIM} in fact
shares the asymptotic nature of $\cal M$. We also investigate the issue of
balancing initial data in order to remove gravity waves. This is a question of
how to compute an ``initialized'' point on $\cal M$ whose subsequent evolution
matches that from the measured initial data that in general lie off $\cal M$.
We propose a choice based on the intuitive idea that the initialization
procedure should not significantly alter the forecast. Numerical results
demonstrate the utility of our initialization scheme. The normal form for
Lorenz' atmospheric model shows clearly how to separate the dynamics of the
different atmospheric waves. However, its construction demonstrates that {\em
any} initialization procedure must eventually alter the forecast--the
time-scale of the divergence between the initialized and the uninitialized
solutions is inevitable and is inversely proportional to the square of initial
level of gravity-wave activity.

transformations and \QTR{em}{``ipso facto''} they lead to problems when we try
quantizing them straightforwardly. To circumvent this problem we need to
specify a gauge condition to fix the gauge so that the fields that are
connected by gauge invariance are not overcounted in the process of
quantization. The usual way we do this in the light-front is through the
introduction of a Lagrange multiplier, $(n\cdot A)^{2}$, where $n_{\mu}$ is the
external light-like vector, i.e., $n^{2}=0$, and $A_{\mu}$ is the vector
potential. This leads to the usual light-front propagator with all the ensuing
characteristics such as the prominent $(k\cdot n)^{-1}$ pole which has been the
subject of much research. However, it has been for long recognized that this
procedure is incomplete in that there remains a residual gauge freedom still to
be fixed by some ``ad hoc'' prescription, and this is normally worked out to
remedy some unwieldy aspect that emerges along the way. In this work we propose
a new Lagrange multiplier for the light-front gauge that leads to the correctly
defined propagator with no residual gauge freedom left. This is accomplished
via $(n\cdot A)(\partial \cdot A)$ term in the Lagrangian density. This leads
to a well-defined and exact though Lorentz non invariant propagator.

systems of charged particles interacting via an unscreened r^-2 force, allowing
for bulk potentials admitting both regular and chaotic orbits. Both for
ensembles and individual orbits, as N increases there is a smooth convergence
towards a continuum limit. Discreteness effects are well modeled by Gaussian
white noise with relaxation time t_R = const * (N/log L)t_D, with L the Coulomb
logarithm and t_D the dynamical time scale. Discreteness effects accelerate
emittance growth for initially localised clumps. However, even allowing for
discreteness effects one can distinguish between orbits which, in the continuum
limit, feel a regular potential, so that emittance grows as a power law in
time, and chaotic orbits, where emittance grows exponentially. For sufficiently
large N, one can distinguish two different `kinds' of chaos. Short range
microchaos, associated with close encounters between charges, is a generic
feature, yielding large positive Lyapunov exponents X_N which do not decrease
with increasing N even if the bulk potential is integrable. Alternatively,
there is the possibility of larger scale macrochaos, characterised by smaller
Lyapunov exponents X_S, which is present only if the bulk potential is chaotic.
Conventional computations of Lyapunov exponents probe X_N, leading to the
oxymoronic conclusion that N-body orbits which look nearly regular and have
sharply peaked Fourier spectra are `very chaotic.' However, the `range' of the
microchaos, set by the typical interparticle spacing, decreases as N increases,
so that, for large N, this microchaos, albeit very strong, is largely
irrelevant macroscopically. A more careful numerical analysis allows one to
estimate both X_N and X_S.

aspect-ratio expansion to show that normal MHD equilibria (with axisymmetric
nested flux surfaces, non-singular fields, and monotonic peaked pressure
profiles) can not exist with negative central current. We extend that proof
here to arbitrary aspect ratio, using a variant of the virial theorem to derive
a relatively simple integral constraint on the equilibrium. However, this

surfaces, or equilibria with singular fields and/or hollow pressure profiles

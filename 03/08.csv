galactic winds outflowing along the minor axis of both galaxies (but
particularly the northern) are observed, and spectral and spatial properties,
and energetics are presented. That such a phenomenon can occur in such a
rapidly-evolving and turbulent system is surprising, and this is the first time
that the very beginning - the onset, of starburst-driven hot gaseous outflow in
a full-blown disk-disk merger has been seen. Point source emission is seen at
the galaxy nuclei, and within the interaction-induced tidal tails. Further
point source emission is associated with the galactic bar in the southern
system. A comparison of the source X-ray luminosity function and of the diffuse
emission properties is made with the Antennae and other galaxies, and evidence
of a more rapid evolution of the source population than the diffuse component
is found. No evidence for variability is found between the Chandra and previous
observations.

taken to correspond to the convergence of the first two moments of $f(l)$ -

symmetry and integrating over the radial profile of the flow, thus considerably
reducing the computation time. We present results for a number of different
initial jet structures, including several different power-laws and a Gaussian
profile for the dependence of the energy per unit solid angle, $\epsilon$, and
the Lorentz factor, $\Gamma$, on the angle from the jet symmetry axis. Our
choice of parameters for the various calculations is motivated by the current
knowledge of relativistic outflows from gamma-ray bursts and the observed
afterglow light-curves. Comparison of the light curves for different jet
profiles with GRB afterglow observations provides constraints on the jet
structure. One of the main results we find is that the transverse fluid
velocity in the comoving frame ($v_t$) and the speed of sideways expansion, for
smooth jet profiles, is typically much smaller than the speed of sound ($c_s$)
throughout much of the evolution of the jet; $v_t$ approaches $c_s$ when
$\Gamma$ along the jet axis becomes of order a few (for large angular gradient
of $\epsilon$, $v_t\sim c_s$ while $\Gamma$ is still large). This result
suggests that the dynamics of relativistic structured jets may be reasonably
described by a simple analytic model where $\epsilon$ is independent of time,
as long as $\Gamma$ along the jet-axis is larger than a few.

The only two experiments that have probed this energy range, AGASA and HiRes,

GZK feature while AGASA reported a larger than expected flux of so-called
Super-GZK particles. Here we emphasize that neither experiment has gathered the
statistics necessary for making a definitive measurement of the GZK cutoff. The
photo-pion production responsible for the GZK feature is stochastic for

low statistics measurements. We show that the results from AGASA and HiRes

different from BCS theory as the gain in the condesation energy is a reult of

and thin copper films on the polar oxygen and zinc terminated surfaces of ZnO
are studied using periodic density-functional calculations. We find that the
binding energy of Cu atoms sensitively depends on how charge neutrality of the
polar surfaces is achieved. Bonding is very strong if the surfaces are
stabilized by an electronic mechanism which leads to partially filled surface
bands. As soon as the surface bands are filled (either by partial Cu coverage,
by coadsorbates, or by the formation of defects), the binding energy decreases
significantly. In this case, values very similar to those found for nonpolar
surfaces and for copper on finite ZnO clusters are obtained. Possible
implications of these observations concerning the growth mode of copper on
polar ZnO surfaces and their importance in catalysis are discussed.

additional decoherence effects in the nu_mu-->nu_tau channel do not improve the

These sets have interesting clustering and fractal properties: we show that for
$\beta \in (0,1)$, a disc of radius $n^{\beta}$ centered at nonrandom $x$
typically contains about $n^{2\beta (1-\alpha /\beta ^2)}$ points from
$\mathcal{L}_n(\alpha)$ (and is empty if $\beta <\sqrt{\alpha} $), whereas
choosing the center $x$ of the disc uniformly in $\mathcal{L}_n(\alpha)$ boosts
the typical number of $\alpha, n$-late points in it to $n^{2\beta (1-\alpha)}$.
We also estimate the typical number of pairs of $\alpha$, $n$-late points
within distance $n^{\beta}$ of each other; this typical number can be
significantly smaller than the expected number of such pairs, calculated by
Brummelhuis and Hilhorst [Phys. A 176 (1991) 387--408]. On the other hand, our
results show that the number of ordered pairs of late points within distance
$n^{\beta}$ of each other is larger than what one might predict by multiplying
the total number of late points, by the number of late points in a disc of
radius $n^{\beta}$ centered at a typical late point.

unless j=k. The definition extends to quantum computations, where j and k vary
over the 2^n binary expressions for integers 0,1 ..., 2^n-1, given n qubits.
Such operators do not affect outcomes of the projective measurement {<j| ; 0 <=

techniques requires either O(n^2 2^n) controlled-not gates and one-qubit Bloch
sphere rotations or else O (n 2^n) such gates and a work qubit. This work
provides a recursive, constructive procedure which inputs the matrix
coefficients of U and outputs such a diagram containing 2^{n+1}-3 alternating
controlled-not gates and one-qubit z-axis Bloch sphere rotations. Up to a
factor of two, these circuits are the smallest possible. Moreover, should the

of controlled-not gates reduces our circuit to that of an n-qubit tensor.

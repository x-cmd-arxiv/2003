Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). Our follow-up low-resolution
spectroscopy of 16 candidates provided two objects, OGLE-TR-3 and OGLE-TR-10,
which have companions with radii compatible with those of gas-giant planets.
Further high-resolution spectroscopy revealed a very low velocity variation
(<500m/s) of the host star OGLE-TR-3 which may be caused by its unseen
companion. An analysis of the radial velocity and light curve results in M<2.5
M_jup, R<1.6 R_jup, and an orbital separation of about 5 R_sol, which makes it
the planet with the shortest period known. This allows to identify the
low-luminosity companion of OGLE-TR-3 as a possible new gas-giant planet. If
confirmed, this makes OGLE-TR-3 together with OGLE-TR-56 the first extrasolar
planets detected via their transit light curves.

faintness of the nuclei at optical wavelengths, are used to characterize the
host galaxies, measure the nuclear contribution to the total observed I-band

to lie in galaxies with a variety of morphologies, luminosities, and dynamical
states, not unlike those hosting radio-quiet PG QSOs. Our analysis suggests
that the extraordinary red colors of the 2MASS QSOs are caused by extinction of
an otherwise typical QSO spectrum due to dust near the nucleus.

dwarf ellipticals (dEs) taken to date. Based on this data we argue that a
significant fraction of Virgo cluster dEs recently underwent evolution. Our new
observations consist of HI 21-cm line observations for 22 classified dE
galaxies with optical radial velocities consistent with membership in the Virgo
cluster. Cluster members VCC 390 and VCC 1713 are detected with HI masses M(HI)
= 6*10^7 M_solar and 8*10^7 M_solar, respectively, while M(HI) in the remaining
20 dE galaxies have upper limits as low as 5*10^5 M_solar. We combine our
results with those for 27 other Virgo cluster dEs with HI observations in the
literature, 7 of which have HI detection claims. New optical images from the
WIYN telescope of 5 of these HI-detected dEs, along with archival data, suggest
that seven of the claimed detections are real, yielding a ~ 15% detection rate.
These HI-detected classified dEs are preferentially located near the periphery
of the Virgo cluster. Three Virgo dEs have observed HI velocity widths > 200
km/s, possibly indicating the presence of a large dark matter content, or
transient extended HI. We discuss the possible origins of these objects and
argue that they originate from field galaxies accreted onto high angular
momentum orbits by Virgo in the last few Gyr. As a result these galaxies are
slowly transformed within the cluster by gradual gas stripping processes,
associated truncation of star formation, and passive fading of stellar
populations. Low-mass early-type cluster galaxies are therefore currently being
produced as the product of cluster environmental effects. We utilize our
results to estimate the recent (past 1-3 Gyr) average mass accretion rate into
the Virgo cluster, finding dM/dt ~ 50 M_solar/year.

the presence of a strong brane-bulk coupling is vastly different from the usual
case of a weak coupling. In particular, some active neutrinos could be absorbed
by the bulk when they oscillate from one kind to another, a signature which can
be taken as the presence of an extra dimension. In a very large class of models
which we shall discuss, the amount of absorption for all neutrino oscillations
is controlled by a single parameter, a property which distinguishes extra
dimensions from other mechanisms for losing neutrino fluxes.

the NN amplitude at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) of chiral perturbation
theory. This analysis does not apply the uniquely-determined and
model-independent NN amplitudes at NNLO and uses, instead, amplitudes that are
up 90% smaller. We point out that this flaw produces a large systematic error,
rendering the Nijmegen method unsuitable for a reliable determination of the
LEC.

with contact interactions. They are obtained from a universal scaling function
calculated within a renormalized scheme for three particles interacting through
pairwise Dirac-delta interaction. The root-mean-square distance between two
atoms of mass $m_A$ in a triatomic molecule are estimated to be of de order of
${\cal C}\sqrt{\hbar^2/[m_A(E_3-E_2)]}$, where $E_2$ is the dimer and $E_3$ the
trimer binding energies, and ${\cal C}$ is a constant (varying from $\sim 0.6$
to $\sim 1$) that depends on the ratio between $E_2$ and $E_3$. Considering
previous estimates for the trimer energies, we also predict the sizes of
Rubidium and Sodium trimers in atomic traps.

"physics/0303034","J. B. Almeida","Jose B. Almeida","Elementary Particles as Solutions of a 4-Dimensional Source Equation","13 pages, 1 figure. Minor corrections and format change in V2",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The author discusses particular solutions of a second order equation
designated by source equation. This equation is special because the metric of
the space where it is written is influenced by the solution, rendering the
equation recursive. The recursion mechanism is established via a first order
equation which bears some resemblance to Dirac equation. In this paper the
author limits the discussion to solutions with constant norm but makes use of
4-dimensional hypercomplex numbers in matrix representation, a concept that is
formally introduced in a section devoted to that aspect. The particular
solutions that are found exhibit symmetries that can be assigned to spin,
electric and color charges of elementary particles, leaving mass as a free
parameter. Massless particles can also be assigned to special solutions of the
source equation, with the cases of photons, gluons and gravitons clearly
identified, together with another massless particle which does not seem to be
related to anything detected experimentally. Another section deals with
particle dynamics under fields, showing that both gravitational and
electrodynamics can be modelled by geodesics of the spaces whose metric tensors
result from the recursion mechanism. Finally the author suggests two lines of
future work, one deriving fields from densities and currents of masses and
charges and the other one aimed at determining particles' masses.

  appear in Theory of Computing",,,,"quant-ph gr-qc",,"  Can Grover's algorithm speed up search of a physical region - for example a
2-D grid of size sqrt(n) by sqrt(n)? The problem is that sqrt(n) time seems to
be needed for each query, just to move amplitude across the grid. Here we show
that this problem can be surmounted, refuting a claim to the contrary by
Benioff. In particular, we show how to search a d-dimensional hypercube in time
O(sqrt n) for d at least 3, or O((sqrt n)(log n)^(3/2)) for d=2. More
generally, we introduce a model of quantum query complexity on graphs,
motivated by fundamental physical limits on information storage, particularly
the holographic principle from black hole thermodynamics. Our results in this
model include almost-tight upper and lower bounds for many search tasks; a
generalized algorithm that works for any graph with good expansion properties,
not just hypercubes; and relationships among several notions of `locality' for
unitary matrices acting on graphs. As an application of our results, we give an
O(sqrt(n))-qubit communication protocol for the disjointness problem, which
improves an upper bound of Hoyer and de Wolf and matches a lower bound of
Razborov.

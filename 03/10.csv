different Initial Mass Functions. We show that a number of ""bottom--light"" IMFs
(namely, with less mass locked in low-mass stars than the standard Salpeter
IMF), suggested independently in recent literature, do imply M/L ratios as low
as mentioned above, at least for late type spirals (Sbc/Sc). This conclusion
still holds when the bulge contribution to mass and light is included. We also
predict the typical stellar M/L ratio, and correspondingly the zero-point of
the Tully-Fisher relation, to vary considerably with Hubble type (about 0.5-0.7
mag in the red bands, from Sa to Sc type).
  For some of the bottom-light IMFs considered, the efficiency of metal
production tends to exceed what is typically estimated for spiral galaxies.
Suitable tuning of the IMF mass limits, post-supernova fallback of metals onto
black holes or metal outflows must then be invoked, to reproduce the observed
chemical properties of disc galaxies.

thought to occur in pulsars, gamma-ray bursts and relativistic jets from

can in principle be dissipated by magnetic reconnection, and used to accelerate
the flow. We investigate how rapidly this transition can take place, by
implementing into a global MHD model, that uses a thermodynamic description of
the plasma, explicit, physically motivated prescriptions for the dissipation
rate: a lower limit on this rate is given by limiting the maximum drift speed
of the current carriers to that of light, an upper limit follows from demanding
that the dissipation zone expand only subsonically in the comoving frame and a
further prescription is obtained by assuming that the expansion speed is
limited by the growth rate of the relativistic tearing mode. In each case,
solutions are presented which give the Lorentz factor of a spherical wind
containing a transverse, oscillating magnetic field component as a function of
radius. In the case of the Crab pulsar, we find that the Poynting flux can be
dissipated before the wind reaches the inner edge of the Nebula if the pulsar
emits electron positron pairs at a rate >1.E40 per second, thus providing a
possible solution to the sigma-problem.

generated in an inhomogeneous relativistic outflow that arises from a fireball.
In such shocks, the Fermi acceleration of protons is naturally expected to be
at least as efficient as that of electrons. We investigate the consequences of
proton acceleration in the residual thermal photon field of a fireball,
especially those on the emission spectra of photons. In contrast to most other
studies, we do not invoke a direct electron acceleration in shock waves. We
show that the residual radiation field of the fireball can ignite the photopion
production and subsequent cascade, and that the photons emitted in this process
further enhance the photon-initiated cascade. We find that Fermi accelerated
protons with $\gtrsim 10^{13}$ eV efficiently bring their energy into pion
production and subsequent photon emission. The particles cascading from the
pions emit photons over a wide energy range. The photons emitted from
electron--positron pairs distribute continuously from the GeV range down to the
X-ray range, while muons can emit gamma-rays by synchrotron radiation with a
break at around 1--10 MeV. We also discuss several radiation processes which
may possibly produce a break feature in the MeV range, as observed in addition
to muon synchrotron radiation.

envelope provide constraints on the physical quantities which enter the
theoretical formulation of a stochastic excitation model of solar p modes, for
instance the convective velocities and the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum.
These constraints are then used to compute the acoustic excitation rate for
solar p modes, P. The resulting values are found ~5 times larger than the
values resulting from a computation in which convective velocities and entropy
fluctuations are obtained with a 1D solar envelope model built with the
time-dependent, nonlocal Gough (1977) extension of the mixing length
formulation for convection (GMLT). This difference is mainly due to the assumed
mean anisotropy properties of the velocity field in the excitation region. The
3D simulation suggests much larger horizontal velocities compared to vertical
ones than in the 1D GMLT solar model. The values of P obtained with the 3D
simulation constraints however are still too small compared with the values
inferred from solar observations. Improvements in the description of the
turbulent kinetic energy spectrum and its depth dependence yield further
increased theoretical values of P which bring them closer to the observations.
It is also found that the source of excitation arising from the advection of
the turbulent fluctuations of entropy by the turbulent movements contributes ~
65-75 % to the excitation and therefore remains dominant over the Reynolds
stress contribution. The derived theoretical values of P obtained with the 3D
simulation constraints remain smaller by a factor ~3 compared with the solar
observations. This shows that the stochastic excitation model still needs to be
improved.

the valence band maximum in the N local charge, taking place at the N

In-rich N local environments such as In4N whose the electronic structure

fields equivalently as a single algebra-valued spin-2 field and single
algebra-valued spin-3/2 field, where the underlying algebra is factorized into
a field-coupling part and an internal multiplication part. The condition that
there exist a gauge invariant Lagrangian (to within a divergence) for these
algebra-valued fields is used to derive determining equations whose solutions
give all allowed deformation terms, yielding nonlinear field equations and
nonabelian gauge symmetries, together with all allowed formal multiplication
rules as needed in the Lagrangian for demonstration of invariance under the
gauge symmetries and for derivation of the field equations. In the case of
spin-2 fields alone, the main result of this analysis is that all deformations
(without any higher derivatives than appear in the linear theory) are
equivalent to an algebra-valued Einstein gravity theory. By a systematic
examination of factorizations of the algebra, a novel type of nonlinear gauge
theory of two or more spin-2 fields is found, where the coupling for the fields
is based on structure constants of an anticommutative, anti-associative
algebra, and with formal multiplication rules that make the fields
anticommuting (while products obey anti-associativity). Supersymmetric

phases rearranges the gauge symmetry. In the nonsupersymmetric SU(5) model the
presence of bulk fermions leads to the spontaneous breaking of color SU(3). In
the supersymmetric model with Scherk-Schwarz SUSY breaking, color SU(3) is
spontaneously broken even in the absence of bulk fermions if there are Higgs
multiplets.

of $\ssb$, the CP-violating asymmetries and branching ratios of $B \to \pi^+
\pi^-, \pi^+ \pi^0$ and $K^0 \pi^+$ decays. In the SM, the measured $\ssb$
leads to an upper limit on $\alpha$: $\alpha \leq 180^\circ-\beta$. Taking the
weighted-average of the newest BaBar and Belle measurements of $\spp$ and
$\app$ in $B^0 \to \pi^+\pi^-$ decay as the experimental input, we find the
allowed range of angle $\alpha$, $76^\circ \leq \alpha \leq 135^\circ$ for
$r=|P/T| =0.3 \pm 0.1 $. From the measured CP-averaged branching ratios of $B
\to \pi^+ \pi^-, \pi^+ \pi^0$ and $K^0 \pi^+$ decays, we found an inequality,
$\cos{\alpha} \cos{\delta} \geq 0.45$. The region of $70^\circ \leq \alpha \leq
110^\circ$ is thus excluded by applying this inequality. The combined
constraints on $\alpha$ and $\delta$ are $117^\circ \leq \alpha \leq 135^\circ$
and $-160^\circ \leq \delta \leq -132^\circ$ if we take $\spp=0.49 \pm 0.27$
and $\app=0.51 \pm 0.19$ as the experimental input. The new lower limit on the
angle $\alpha$ is dominated by the measured branching ratios considered in this
paper, and is much stronger than those obtained before.

coupling induces the flavor-violating mass terms for the right-handed down
squarks and left-handed sleptons, and they lead to imprint on the flavor
physics in the hadronic and leptonic sectors. In this paper we study CP
violation in $B_d^0$ and $B_s^0$, which is induced by the tau-neutrino Yukawa
coupling. In particular, we notice the correlation of the CP asymmetries in
$B_d^0\to \phi K_s$ ($S_{\phi K_s}$) and $B_s^0\to J/\psi \phi$ ($S_{J/\psi
\phi}$) with other observables, such as $Br(\tau\to\mu\gamma)$, the muon EDM
($d_\mu$), and the mixing-induced CP asymmetry in $B_d^0\to M_s^0\gamma$
($A_{bsg}$), since they have a common origin of the CP and flavor violation.
The measurements are expected to play a significant role for consistency check
of the SUSY SU(5) GUT. The hierarchical right-handed neutrino masses make the
correlation better. We find that the current bound on $Br(\tau\to\mu\gamma)$
constrains the allowed region for $S_{\phi K_s}$ in this model.

The study is based on the equation of motion of a minimum set of operators
which is then used to define the state of the system. The relation between the
quantum framework and thermodynamical observables is examined. A four stroke
heat engine model with a coupled two-level-system as a working fluid is used to
explore the fundamental relations. In the model used, the internal Hamiltonian
does not commute with the external control field which defines the two
adiabatic branches. Heat is transferred to the working fluid by coupling to hot
and cold reservoirs under constant field values. Explicit quantum equation of
motion for the relevant observables are derived on all branches. The dynamics
on the heat transfer constant field branches is solved in closed form. On the
adiabats, a general numerical solution is used and compared with a particular
analytic solution. These solutions are combined to construct the cycle of
operation. The engine is then analyzed in terms of frequency-entropy and
entropy-temperature graphs. The irreversible nature of the engine is the result
of finite heat transfer rates and friction-like behavior due to
noncommutability of the internal and external Hamiltonian.

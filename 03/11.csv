in stellar brightness due to transiting objects has been around for decades. It
has only been in the last ten years, however, that any serious attempts to find
ESPs became practical. The discovery of a transiting planet around the star HD
209458 (Charbonneau et al. 2000) has led to a veritable explosion of research,
because the photometric method is the only way to search a large number of
stars for ESPs simultaneously with current technology. To this point, however,
there has been limited research into the various techniques used to extract the
subtle transit signals from noise, mainly brief summaries in various papers
focused on publishing transit-like signatures in observations. The scheduled
launches over the next few years of satellites whose primary or secondary
science missions will be ESP discovery motivates a review and a comparative
study of the various algorithms used to perform the transit identification, to
determine rigorously and fairly which one is the most sensitive under which
circumstances, to maximize the results of past, current, and future
observational campaigns.

quasar J1819+3845. We observe large yearly changes in the timescale of the
variations (from ~ 1 hour to ~ 10 hours at 5GHz). This annual effect can only
be explained if the variations are caused by a propagation effect, and thus
affected by the Earth's relative speed through the projected intensity pattern.
To account for this effect, the scattering plasma must have a transverse
velocity with respect to the local standard of rest.
  The velocity calculated from these observations is in good agreement with
that obtained from a two telescope delay experiment (Dennett-Thorpe & de Bruyn
2001). We also show that either the source itself is elongated, or that the
scattering plasma is anisotropic, with an axial ratio of >6:1. As the source is
extended on scales relevant to the scattering phenomenon, it seems plausible
that the anisotropy is due to the source itself, but this remains to be
investigated. From the scintillation characteristics we find that the
scattering material is a very strong, thin scatterer within ~ten parsecs. We
determine a source size at 5GHz of 100 to 900microarcsecs, and associated
brightness temperatures of 10^{10} to 10^{12}K.

color-magnitude diagrams for each field reaching $V\simeq26$. The magnitude of
the tip of the red giant branch and the red clump were used to determine
distances to NGC 6822 that are consistent with previous ground-based
measurements. The distance, extinction and star formation history were also
determined by fitting the entire color-magnitude diagram in each field. The
distances from these fits are consistent with the other determinations within
the estimated errors once the systematic effects of uncertainties in the
age-metallicity relation are taken into account. The extinction varies among
the four fields from approximately the foreground Galactic value to $\approx
0.4$ mag higher in $V$ and roughly correlates with the $60\micron$ surface
brightness. The star formation histories in the four fields are similar for
ages $\gtrsim 1$ Gyr and are relatively constant or somewhat increasing with
time. These old star formation rates are comparable to that expected from the
typical gas surface densities at these galactocentric radii and suggest that no
large scale redistribution of gas or stars is required to account for the
inferred star formation rates. Three of the fields show a drop of a factor of
$\sim 2-4$ in the star formation rate about 600 Myr ago while the remaining

utilize the results of our analysis to construct a toy model of a disc at a
temperature and density such that relativistic particles are more abundant than
nucleons, and dominate both the opacity and pressure. The nucleons will still
provide most of the energy density. In the toy model we take the rate of heat

star-to-star variation, despite often containing multiple generations of stars.
The total metal content in these systems is much less than expected from the
heavy element production of massive stars in each episode of star formation.
Such a deficiency implies that a substantial fraction of the enriched material
has been lost from these small galaxies. Mass ejection from dwarf galaxies may
have important consequences for the evolution of the intergalactic medium and
for the evolution of massive galaxies, which themselves may have formed via the
merger of smaller systems. We report here the results of three-dimensional
simulations of the evolution of supernova-enriched gas within dwarf spheroidal
galaxies (dSph's), with the aim of determining the retention efficiency of
supernova ejecta. We consider two galaxy models, selected to represent opposite
ends of the dSph sequence. For each model galaxy we investigate a number of
scenarios, ranging from a single supernova in smooth gas distributions to more
complex multiple supernovae in highly disturbed gas distributions. The results
of these investigations suggest that, for low star-formation efficiencies, it
is difficult to completely expel the enriched material from the galaxy. Most of
the enriched gas is, however, lost from the core of the galaxy following
multiple supernovae, especially if the interstellar medium is already highly
disturbed by processes such as photo-ionization and stellar winds. If
subsequent star formation occurs predominantly within the core where most of
the residual gas is concentrated, then these results could explain the poor
self-enrichment efficiency observed in dwarf galaxies.

consistent with scale-invariance, although it allows some indication of a

evidence for a running of the scalar spectral index found by the WMAP team, our

inside Jupiter's orbit, and some reached Apollo orbits with semi-major axes
less than 2 AU, Aten orbits, and inner-Earth orbits (with aphelia less than
0.983 AU) and remained there for millions of years. Though less than 0.1% of
the total, these objects were responsible for most of the collision probability
of former JCOs with Earth and Venus. Some Jupiter-family comets can reach
inclinations i>90 deg. We conclude that a significant fraction of near-Earth

The dominant
mechanism of energy dissipation is assumed to be the magnetic diffusivity due
to turbulence in the accretion flow. In analogy to the advection-dominated
accretion flow (ADAF) solutions, a constant fraction of the resistively
dissipated energy is stored in the accreting gas and the rest is radiated. The
general self-similar solutions which describe a resistive and {\it nonrotating}
flow with purely poloidal magnetic field is first introduced. The radial
dependence of physical quantities is identical to viscous ADAF solutions.
Although the main focus of this study is nonrotating magnetized accretion flow,
for rotating flow with both poloidal and toroidal components of magnetic field
we find the radial scaling of solutions similar to the nonrotating case. We
show that the accretion and the rotation velocities are both below the
Keplerian rate, irrespective of the amount of cooling. We show that the set of
the equations is reduced to a second order differential equation for a
nonrotating flow. The geometrical shape of the disk changes depending on the
fraction of the resistively dissipated energy which is stored in the accreting
gas. However, there is a hot low-density gas above the disk in almost all
cases. The net accretion rate is calculated for a set of illustrative
parameters.

the radio and Ha luminosities, confirming the mid-IR light as a good tracer of
star formation (while SFR based on Ha flux show large scatter and offset, still
to be understood). We have estimated the baryonic masses in stars by fitting
the optical-IR SED, and found that the host galaxies of ISO sources are massive
members of groups with SFR=10 to 300 Msun/yr. We have finally compared this
ongoing SF activity with the already formed stellar masses to estimate the
timescales t(SF) for the stellar build-up, which turn-out to be widely spread
between 0.1 Gyrs to more than 10 Gyr. The faint ISOCAM galaxies appear to form
a composite population, including moderately active but very massive
spiral-like galaxies, and very luminous ongoing starbursts, in a continuous
sequence. From the observed t(SF), assuming typical starburst timescales, we
infer that, with few exceptions, only a fraction of the galactic stars can be
formed in any single starburst, while several of such episodes during a
protracted SF history are required for the whole galactic build-up.

peculiar (CP) stars of spectral types B to F from other classes of stars in the

system which can be used to explore the capability of model atmospheres with
individual element abundances to predict photometric Delta a magnitudes which
measure the extent of the flux depression around 5200A found in different types
of CP stars. In this first paper, we confirm the observed dependency of the
a-index as a function of various colour indices sensitive to the effective
temperature of stars as well as its average scatter expected from surface
gravity variations within the main sequence band. The behaviour of the
so-called normality line of Delta a systems used in photometric observations of
CP stars is well reproduced. The metallicity dependence of the normality line
of the Delta a system was computed for several grids of model atmospheres where
the abundances of elements heavier than He had been scaled +-0.5 dex with
respect to the solar value. We estimate a lowering of Delta a magnitudes for CP
stars within the Magellanic Clouds by approximately -3 mmag relative to those
in the solar neighbourhood assuming an average metallicity of [Fe/H]= -0.5 dex.
Using these results on the metallicity bias of the Delta a system we find the
observational systems in use suitable to identify CP stars in other galaxies or
distant regions of our own galaxy and capable to provide data samples on a
statistically meaningful basis. In turn, the synthetic system is suitable to
test the performance of model atmospheres for CP stars. This work will be

laser (phaser) operating at 9 GHz with an electromagnetic pumping at 23 GHz.
The resonance is manifested by very slow cooperative self-detunings in the
microwave spectra of stimulated phonon emission when pumping is modulated at a
superlow frequency (less than 10 Hz). During the self-detuning cycle new and
new narrow phonon modes are sequentially ``fired'' on one side of the spectrum
and approximately the same number of modes are ``extinguished'' on the other
side, up to a complete generation breakdown in a certain final portion of the
frequency axis. This is usually followed by a short-time refractority, after
which the generation is fired again in the opposite (starting) portion of the
frequency axis. The entire process of such cooperative spectral motions is
repeated with high degree of regularity. The self-detuning period strongly
depends on difference between the modulation frequency and the resonance
frequency. This period is incommensurable with period of modulation. It
increases to very large values (more than 100 s) when pointed difference is
less than 0.05 Hz. The revealed phenomenon is a kind of global spin-phonon
self- organization. All microwave modes of phonon laser oscillate with the same
period, but with different, strongly determined phase shifts - as in optical
lasers with antiphase motions.

be traced by tuning the disorder strength.

invariant (the Euler characteristic) of certain submanifolds in the
configuration space of two physical models. The models are the mean-field XY
model and the one-dimensional XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions. The
former model undergoes a second-order phase transition at a finite critical
temperature while the latter has no phase transitions. The computation of this
topologic invariant is performed within the framework of Morse theory. In both
models topology changes in configuration space are present as the potential
energy is varied; however, in the mean-field model there is a particularly
""strong"" topology change, corresponding to a big jump in the Euler
characteristic, connected with the phase transition, which is absent in the
one-dimensional model with no phase transition. The comparison between the two
models has two major consequences: i) it lends new and strong support to a
recently proposed topological approach to the study of phase transitions; ii)
it allows us to conjecture which particular topology changes could entail a
phase transition in general. We also discuss a simplified illustrative model of
the topology changes connected to phase transitions using of two-dimensional
surfaces, and a possible direct connection between topological invariants and

energies above E_{GZK} ~ 4 x 10^{19} eV loose a large fraction of their
energies by the photoproduction of pions on the cosmic microwave background,
which finally decay mainly into neutrinos. In our scenario, these so-called
cosmogenic neutrinos interact with nucleons in the atmosphere through Standard
Model electroweak instanton-induced processes and produce air showers which are
hardly distinguishable from ordinary hadron-initiated air showers. In this way,
they give rise to a second contribution to the observed cosmic ray spectrum --
in addition to the one from above mentioned protons -- which reaches beyond
E_{GZK}. Since the whole observed spectrum is uniquely determined by a single
primary injection spectrum, no fine tuning is needed to fix the ratio of the

goodness of this scenario. Possible tests of it range from observations at

an experiment. We conclude that this experiment will allow determination of the
CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ and the currently unknown mixing parameter
$\theta_{13}$, if $\sin ^2 2 \theta_{13} \geq 0.01$, a value $\sim 15$ times
lower than the present experimental upper limit. In addition to $\theta_{13}$
and $\delta_{CP}$, the experiment has great potential for precise measurements
of most other parameters in the neutrino mixing matrix including $\Delta
m^2_{32}$, $\sin^2 2\theta_{23}$, $\Delta m^2_{21}\times \sin 2 \theta_{12}$,
and the mass ordering of neutrinos through the observation of the matter effect

many-to-many quantum communication of the information of a d-level system from
N spatially separated senders to M>N receivers situated at different locations.
We extend the concept of asymmetric telecloning from qubits to d-dimensional
systems. We investigate the broadcasting of entanglement by using local 1->2
optimal universal asymmetric Pauli machines and show that the maximal
fidelities of the two final entangled states are obtained when symmetric
machines are applied. Cloning of entanglement is studied using a nonlocal
optimal universal asymmetric cloning machine and we show that the symmetric
machine optimally copies the entanglement. The ""many-to-many"" teleportation
scheme is applied in order to distribute entanglement shared between two
observers to two pairs of spatially separated observers.

number of N-qubit unitary operations which represent the possible oracles or
which are part of the quantum algorithm. Until now there are no standard ways
to uniformly generate whole classes of N-qubit gates. We have developed a
method to generate arbitrary controlled phase shift operations with a single
network of one-qubit and two-qubit operations. This kind of network can be
adapted to various physical implementations of quantum computing and is
suitable to realize the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm as well as Grover's search
algorithm.

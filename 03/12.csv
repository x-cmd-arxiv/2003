radiation, implying acceleration of cosmic rays by young supernova remnants. We
detect synchrotron emission from Cas A in the near-infrared using Two Micron
All Sky Survey (2MASS) and Palomar 200 inch PFIRCAM observations. The remnant
is detected in J, H, and Ks bands, with Ks band brightest and J faint. In the J
and H bands, bright [Fe II] lines (1.24um and 1.64um) are detected
spectroscopically. The Palomar observations include Ks continuum, narrow-band
1.64um (centered on [Fe II]) and 2.12um (centered on H2(1-0)) images. While the
narrow-band 1.64um image shows filamentary and knotty structures, similar to
the optical image, the Ks image shows a relatively smooth, diffuse shell,
remarkably similar to the radio image. The broad-band near-infrared fluxes of
Cas A are generally consistent with, but a few tens of percent higher than, an
extrapolation of the radio fluxes. The hardening to higher frequencies is
possibly due to nonlinear shock acceleration and/or spectral index variation
across the remnant. We show evidence of spectral index variation. The presence
of near-infrared synchrotron radiation requires the roll-off frequency to be
higher than 1.5e14 Hz, implying that electrons are accelerated to energies of
at least 0.2 TeV. The morphological similarity in diffuse emission between the
radio and Ks band images implies that synchrotron losses are not dominant. Our
observations show unambiguous evidence that the near-infrared Ks band emission
of Cas A is from synchrotron emission by accelerated cosmic-ray electrons.

In agreement with previous results for the global GC kinematics based on
smaller datasets, we find that the GC system as a whole exhibits a slow overall
rotation that is due almost entirely to a net rotation of the metal-poor GC
subsystem alone. In a spatial average, the metal-rich GCs shows essentially no
rotation. We note, however, the presence of a well defined grouping of 10
metal-rich GCs that are located at opposite poles along the galaxy's major axis
and which appear to be rotating at nearly 300 km/s about the minor axis. This
grouping may be the relic of a past merger or accretion event. Using a
Jeans-equation analysis, we show that the GC radial velocities alone point
unequivocally (and independently of X-ray observations) to the need for a
massive dark halo associated with M49 and the Virgo B subcluster around it. We
also show that the GC system as a whole is consistent with an almost perfectly
isotropic velocity ellipsoid. M49 is now the second elliptical galaxy (after
M87) for which we have been able to demonstrate velocity isotropy in the

At the same time, both velocity and density radial distributions remain almost
unchanged given the speed of the rapidly diverging flow.
  The rapid fall in temperature as a function of radius reduces the size of the
zone radiating in X-rays and decreases the superwind X-ray luminosity. At the

promotes the establishment of an extended ionized fast moving envelope. This

Thomson optical depth are still relatively large, with tau_e=0.17+-0.04 (68%)
(Kogut et al 2003), important implications on Pop III star formation processes

(1) in the absence of a top-heavy initial stellar mass function (IMF) for Pop
III metal-free stars and without a dramatic upturn in the star formation
efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction at high redshift (z>6), we find
tau_e =< 0.09; (2) with a top-heavy IMF for the Pop III metal-free stars and
plausible star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction, it is
expected that tau_e =< 0.12; (3) it is possible to reach tau_e = 0.15, if the
metal enrichment efficiency of the intergalactic medium by Pop III stars is
very low thus Pop III era is prolonged; (4) to reach tau_e >= 0.17 requires
either of the following two conditions: the cosmological model power index n is
positively tilted to n >= 1.03, Pop III star formation in minihalos with
molecular hydrogen cooling has an efficiency c_*(H_2,III)>0.01 (with ionizing
photon escape fraction greater than 30%). If the current observed value of

evidence that Pop III stars are massive and their formation efficiency may be

depends on the heating and cooling processes. It is essential to realize that
all physical processes that contribute operate on different time scales. In
particular detailed balancing is often violated since the statistically inverse
process of e.g. collisional ionization is recombination of an ion with two
electrons, which as a three-body collision is usually dominated by radiative
recombination, causing a departure from collisional ionization equilibrium. On
top of these differences in atomic time scales, hot plasmas are often in a
dynamical state, thereby introducing another time scale, which can be the
shortest one. The non-equilibrium effects will be illustrated and discussed in
the case of galactic outflows. It will be shown, that spectral analyses of
X-ray data of edge-on galaxies show a clear signature in the form of
""multi-temperature"" halos, which can most naturally be explained by the
""freezing-in"" of highly ionized species in the outflow, which contribute to the
overall spectrum by DELAYED RECOMBINATION. This naturally leads to a
non-equilibrium cooling function, which modifies the dynamics, which in turn
changes the plasma densities and thermal energy budget, thus feeding back on
the ionization structure. Therefore SELF-CONSISTENT modelling is needed.

perturbing satellite. We also consider models with a dominant gaseous component
in the disk. We find that in general bar formation requires disk masses at
least a factor of 2 higher than those inferred for LSBs under the assumption of
a normal stellar mass-to-light ratio. Low surface density stellar disks
contributing less than 10% of the total virial mass are stable within NFW halos
spanning a range of concentrations. However, a purely gaseous disk can form a
bar even for quite low masses and for realistic temperatures provided that
cooling is very efficient (we adopt an isothermal equation of state) and that
the halo has a very low concentration, c < 5. The bars that form in these LSB
models are shorter than the typical halo scale radius - their overall angular
momentum content might be too low to affect significantly the inner dark halo
structure. Once formed, all the bars evolve into bulge-like structures in a few
Gyr and can excite spiral patterns in the surrounding disk component. The
recently discovered red LSBs show significant non-axisymmetric structure and
bulge-like components and share many of their structural properties with the
final states of our LSB models with massive disks. Our results imply that a

of the empirical correlation between the star formation rate and average gas

results of self-consistent cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxy
formation that reproduce the Schmidt law naturally, without assuming it, and
provide some clues to this puzzle. The simulations incorporate the main
physical processes critical to various aspects of galaxy formation and have a
dynamic range high enough to identify individual star forming regions. The
results indicate that the global Schmidt law is a manifestation of the overall
density distribution of the interstellar medium (ISM). In particular, the
density probability distribution function (PDF) in the simulated disks is
similar to that observed in recent state-of-the-art modeling of the turbulent
ISM and has a well-defined generic shape. The shape of the PDF in a given
region of the disk depends on the local average surface density Sigma_g. The
dependence is such that the fraction of gas mass in the high-density tail of
the distribution scales as Sigma_g^{n-1} with n~1.4, which gives rise to the
Schmidt-like correlation. The high-density tail of the PDF is remarkably
insensitive to the inclusion of feedback and details of the cooling and heating
processes. This indicates that the global star formation rate is determined by
the supersonic turbulence driven by gravitational instabilities on large

viewed as a multi-channel intrinsic correlation function (ICF). We find that
the wavelet MEM has lower reconstruction residuals than conventional
pixel-basis MEM in the case when the signal-to-noise ratio is low and the point
spread function narrow. Furthermore, the Bayesian evidence for the wavelet MEM
reconstructions is generally higher for a wide range of images.
  From a Bayesian point of view, the wavelet basis thus provides a better model
of the image.

1-2 10^-8, while the abundance relative to warm H2 is around 10^-7. The
temperatures and NH3 abundances are similar to values found for the Galactic

temperatures and chemical abundances. In the central region of M82, however,
the NH3 emitting gas component is comparatively cool (~ 30K). It must be dense
(to provide sufficient NH3 excitation) and well shielded from dissociating
photons and comprises only a small fraction of the molecular gas mass in M82.
An important molecular component, which is warm and tenuous and characterized
by a low ammonia abundance, can be seen mainly in CO. Photon dominated regions
(PDRs) can explain both the high fraction of warm H_2 in M82 and the observed

matter which scales like radiation matter and then analyse how that model fits
the SN Ia data. In this case the limits on rotation coming from BBN and CMB
anisotropies are also obtained. If we assume that the current estimates are
$\Omega_{\text{m},0}\sim 0.3$, $\Omega_{\text{r},0} \sim 10^{-4}$, then the SN

discrete point sources and extended diffuse emission. The extended emission has
a complex morphology with an extent of 2.4x1.6kpc down to a flux density of
1.3E-13 erg/s/cm2/arcmin2. The best spectral fit to this emission is obtained
with an absorbed, two temperature model giving temperatures for the two gas
components of 0.28keV and 0.86keV, a total mass content of ~10^7 Msun compared
with a galactic mass of several 10^{10} Msun and a total thermal energy content
of ~2.5E55erg, with an average energy injection rate for the galaxy of a few
1E41 erg/s. Comparison of the morphology of the diffuse X-ray emission with
that of the observed Halpha emission shows similarities in the two emissions.
An expanding super-bubble is suggested by the presence of diffuse X-ray
emission within what appears to be a cavity in the Halpha emission. The
kinematics of this bubble suggest an expansion velocity of ~220km/s and a mass
injection rate of 0.14Msun/yr, but the presence of NGC4449's huge HI halo
(r~40kpc) may prevent the ejection, into the IGM, of the metal-enriched
material and energy it contains. The arcsecond-resolution of CHANDRA has
detected 24 X-ray point sources down to a completeness level corresponding to a
flux of ~2E-14 erg/s/cm2, within the optical extent of NGC4449 and analysis of
their spectra has shown them to be from at least 3 different classes of object.
As well as the known SNR in this galaxy, it also harbours several X-ray

method employs a TREESPH code including stellar particles, gas particles,
cooling and heating of the gas, star formation according to a Jeans criterion,
and Supernova feedback. A regular spiral disc can be generated as an
equilibrium situation of two opposing actions. On the one hand cooling and
dissipation of the gas, on the other hand gas heating by the FUV field of young
stars and SN mechanical forcing. The disc exhibits small and medium scale
spiral structure of which the multiplicity increases as a function of radius.
The theory of swing amplification can explain, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, the emerging spiral structure. In addition, swing amplification
predicts that the existence of a grand design m=2 spiral is only possible if
the disc is massive. The simulations show that the galaxy is then unstable to
bar formation. A general criterion is derived for the transition between bar
stable and unstable, depending on disc mass contribution and on disc thickness.
It seems that bar stability hardly depends on the presence of gas. A detailed
quantitative analysis is made of the emerging spiral structure and a comparison
is made with observations. That demonstrates that the structure of the
numerical isolated galaxies is not as strong and has a larger multiplicity
compared to the structure of some exemplary real galaxies. It is argued that a
grand design can only be generated by a central bar or by tidal forces
resulting from an encounter with another galaxy.

the temperature Tmax of a pronounced peak of susceptibility. Thus,
magnetization measurements under hydrostatic pressure reveal that the lattice
contraction in the structure of Sr3Ru2O7 promotes antiferromagnetism and not
ferromagnetism, contrary to the previous beliefs. The effects can be explained
by the enhancement of the inter-bi-layer antiferromagnetic spin coupling,
driven by the shortening of the superexchange path, and suppression, due to the
band-broadening effect, of competing itinerant ferromagnetic correlations.

bounds that are complementary to the KK bounds (i.e. they become severe when

an inflating, non-de Sitter universe is unavoidably ambiguous. The ambiguity is
related to the time at which initial conditions for the mode functions are
specified and to the way the expansion of the universe affects those initial
conditions. In this paper we study the imprint of these uncertainties on the
predictions of inflation. We parametrize the most general set of possible
vacuum initial conditions by two phenomenological variables. We find that the
generated power spectrum receives oscillatory corrections whose amplitude is
proportional to the Hubble parameter over the cutoff scale. In order to further
constrain the phenomenological parameters that characterize the vacuum
definition, we study gravitational particle production during different
cosmological epochs.

certain combinations of spheres, disks, and projective planes, which we
evaluate to four and five loop order. In the case of $Sp(N)$ with antisymmetric
matter, independent results are obtained by computing the nonperturbative
superpotential for $N=4,6$ and 8. Comparison with the Dijkgraaf-Vafa approach
reveals agreement up to $N/2$ loops in matrix model perturbation theory, with
disagreement setting in at $h=N/2+1$ loops, $h$ being the dual Coxeter number.
At this order, the glueball superfield $S$ begins to obey nontrivial relations
due to its underlying structure as a product of fermionic superfields. We
therefore find a relatively simple example of an ${\cal N}=1$ gauge theory
admitting a large $N$ expansion, whose dynamically generated superpotential
differs from the one obtained in the matrix model approach.

YST and its modified version (MYST) have the background symmetry SO(D+1,1) and

to Lorentz-covariance. With respect to MYST, the spatial components of
space-time operators and the time component (energy) of momentum operators have
discrete eigenvalues and their respective minimums, $a$ and 1/R, in contrast to
YST. This discrete structure of YST and MYST, which CFT lacks entirely, may
provide a theoretical ground for the unified regularization or cutoff of
ultraviolet and infrared divergences familiar in the UV/IR connection in the

sufficiently small distance scales, is suggested as an explanation for the
vacuum energy pressure that accelerates the universe. Very-small-scale virtual
vacuum currents are assumed to generate small-scale electromagnetic fields
corresponding to the appearance of a 4-potential $A_{\mu}^{ext} (x)$, which is
itself equal to the vev of the operator $ A_{\mu}(x)$ in the presence of that
$A_{\mu}^{ext}(x)$. The latter condition generates a bootstrap-like equation
for $A_{\mu}^{ext}(x)$ which has an approximate, tachyonic-like solution
corresponding to propagation outside the light cone, and damping inside; this
solution is given in terms of a mass parameter M that turns out to be on the
order of the Planck mass if only the simplest, electron vacuum-bubble is
included; if the muon and tau bubbles are included, M decreases to $\sim 10^6 -
10^7$ GeV. A multiplicative 4-vector $v_{\mu}$, whose magnitude is determined
by a comparison with the average mass density needed to produce the observed
acceleration is introduced, and characterizes the distance d over which the
fields so produced may be expected to be coherent; the present analysis
suggests that d can lie anywhere in the range from $10^{-5} cm$ (corresponding
to a ""spontaneous vacuum phase change"") to $10^{-13}cm$ (representing a
""polarization of the QED vacuum"" by quark-antiquark pairs of the QCD vacuum).
Near the light-cone, such electric fields become large, introducing the
possibility of copious charged-particle pair production, whose
back-reaction-fields tend to diminish the vacuum electric field. The
possibility of an experimental test of the resulting plasma at large momentum
transfers is discussed.

solving either the Schr\""odinger equation or the Dirac equation (labelled as
SRHSWS and SRHDWS, respectively and SRHWS for both). In SRHDWS, the negative
levels in the Dirac Sea must be properly included. The basis in SRHDWS could be
smaller than that in SRHSWS which will simplify the deformed problem. The
results from SRHWS are compared in detail with those from solving the spherical
relativistic Hartree theory in the harmonic oscillator basis (SRHHO) and those
in the coordinate space (SRHR). All of these approaches give identical nuclear
properties such as total binding energies and root mean square radii for stable
nuclei. For exotic nuclei, e.g., $^{72}$Ca, SRHWS satisfactorily reproduces the
neutron density distribution from SRHR, while SRHHO fails. It is shown that the

three remarkable properties: (a) reduced local states are immune to collective
decoherence; (b) distant local setups do not need to be aligned, since the
required perfect correlations are achieved for any local rotation of the local
setups; (c) local measurements require only individual measurements on the
qubits. Indeed, it is shown that this proof is essentially the only one which
fulfils (a), (b), and (c).

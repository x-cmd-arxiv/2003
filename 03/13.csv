one should keep in mind that with the fine-tuning at the level of about one
percent one can obtain a semi-realistic model of a closed inflationary

While massive clusters produce the strongest central SZ decrements, we point
out that a local galaxy halo, specifically the halo of M31, may be one of the
brightest integrated SZ sources in the sky. For various realistic gas
distributions consistent with current X-ray limits, we show that the integrated
SZ decrement from M31 will be comparable to decrements already detected in more
distant sources, provided its halo contains an appreciable quantity of hot gas.
A measurement of this decrement would provide direct information on the mass,
spatial distribution and thermodynamic state of hot gas in a low-mass halo, and
could place important constraints on current models of galaxy formation.
Detecting such an extended (~ 10 degree), low-amplitude signal will be
challenging, but should be possible with all-sky SZ maps from satellite
missions such as the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe or the Planck

halos, giving a clear hint of an outflow of gas and relativistic particles from
the disk into the halo. The driving agents are, not surprisingly, active star
forming regions, injecting hot gas and cosmic rays generated by supernova
remnant and superbubble shock waves. The dynamics of the outflow and the
thermal evolution of the plasma are strongly coupled, and therefore a
self-consistent model is necessary for a satisfactory description. Since the
plasma temperature is between one and a few million Kelvin, the halo is most
conspicuous in soft X-rays. It will be shown that X-ray data obtained recently
with XMM-Newton EPIC pn bear clear spectral signatures that are in strong
disagreement with an isothermal halo in collisional ionization equilibrium
(CIE). Instead a temperature structure in X-ray halos is observed. It will be
demonstrated that a galactic wind outflow model in which the non-equilibrium
ionization structure is calculated self-consistently can give a satisfactory
and physical explanation for the X-ray spectral characteristics, e.g. in case
of the local starburst galaxy NGC 3079. In particular, high subsolar
abundances, that have been reported from X-ray observations in some cases, are
shown to be artefacts of CIE spectral fit models. It is found that spectral
models are strongly constrained by the presence of diagnostic lines such as
OVII and OVIII as well as Fe-L line complexes. Thus a detailed spectral X-ray
model will help to provide important galactic wind parameters, such as mass
loss rate and velocity profile, which may also serve as valuable input for
galactic outflows in the early universe.

arise from the cascade of macroscopic mechanical energy to small scales through
a turbulent cascade. One consequence of this effect is that changes in gas
temperature can arise from near adiabatic compressions and expansions, and this

cluster Cl0024+16 (z~0.4) consisting of a sparse-sampled mosaic of 39 Wide
Field and Planetary Camera 2 images which extends to a cluster radius of 5 Mpc.
[Abridged] We examine both the morphology-radius (T-R) and morphology-density
(T-Sigma) relations and demonstrate sensitivities adequate for measures from
the core to a radius of 5 Mpc, spanning over 3 decades in local projected
density. The fraction of early-type galaxies declines steeply from the cluster
center to 1 Mpc radius and more gradually thereafter, asymptoting towards the
field value at the periphery. We discuss our results in the context of three
distinct cluster zones, defined according to different physical processes that
may be effective in transforming galaxy morphology in each. By treating
infalling galaxies as isolated test particles, we deduce that the most likely
processes responsible for the mild gradient in the morphological mix outside
the virial radius are harassment and starvation. Although more data are needed
to pin down the exact mechanisms, starvation seems more promising in that it
would naturally explain the stellar and dynamical homogeneity of cluster E/S0s.
However, we find significant scatter in the local density at any given radius
outside 0.5 Mpc, and that the same T-Sigma relation holds in subregions of the
cluster, independent of location. In this hitherto unprobed region, where the
potential of the cluster is weak, galaxies apparently retain their identities
as members of infalling sub-groups whose characteristic morphological
properties remain intact. Only upon arrival in the central regions is the
substructure erased, as indicated by the tight correlation between cluster
radius and Sigma.

the planetesimal disk; the subsequent self-limiting accretion mode is referred
to as ``oligarchic growth.'' Here, we begin by expanding on the existing
analytic model of the oligarchic growth regime. From this, we derive global
estimates of the planet formation rate throughout a protoplanetary disk. We
find that a relatively high-mass protoplanetary disk ($\sim$ 10$\times$
minimum-mass) is required to produce giant planet core-sized bodies ($\sim$ 10
M$_{\oplus}$) within the lifetime of the nebular gas ($\la$ 10 million years).
However, an implausibly massive disk is needed to produce even an Earth mass at
the orbit of Uranus by 10 Myrs. Subsequent accretion without the dissipational
effect of gas is even slower and less efficient. In the limit of
non-interacting planetesimals, a reasonable-mass disk is unable to produce
bodies the size of the Solar System's two outer giant planets at their current
locations on {\it any} timescale; if collisional damping of planetesimal random
velocities is sufficiently effective, though, it may be possible for a
Uranus/Neptune to form in situ in less than the age of the Solar System. We
perform numerical simulations of oligarchic growth with gas, and find that
protoplanet growth rates agree reasonably well with the analytic model as long
as protoplanet masses are well below their estimated final masses. However,
accretion stalls earlier than predicted, so that the largest final protoplanet
masses are smaller than those given by the model. Thus the oligarchic growth
model, in the form developed here, appears to provide an upper limit for the
efficiency of giant planet formation.

shells. Temperature maps of a few nearby luminous clusters reveal that the
shells consist of the coolest gas in the clusters -- much cooler than the
surrounding medium. Using simple models, we study the effects of this cool
emission on the inferred cooling flow properties of clusters. We find that the
introduction of bubbles into model clusters that do NOT have cooling flows
results in temperature and surface brightness profiles that resemble those seen
in nearby ""cooling flow"" clusters. They also approximately reproduce the recent
XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of a high minimum temperature of 1-3 keV.
Hence, bubbles, if present, must be taken into account when inferring the
physical properties of the ICM. In the case of some clusters, bubbles may
account entirely for these observed features, calling into question their
designation as clusters with cooling flows. However, since not all nearby

a diverse range of physical phenomena that give rise to the same observed
features.

the detectability of WHIM directly through emission lines of OVII (561, 568,

emission lines of WHIM using a light-cone output of the cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations. Since the predicted fluxes are generally below the
current detection limit, the unambiguous detection requires a dedicated X-ray
satellite mission that we also discuss in detail. We find that our proposed
mission is sensitive to the WHIM with gas temperature $T=10^{6-7}$K and
overdensity $\delta=10-100$ up to a redshift of 0.3 without being significantly
contaminated by the cosmic X-ray background and the Galactic emissions. Thus
such a mission provides a unique and important tool to identify a large

possibility that the equipartition parameters depend on the shock strength and
post-shock density. We then get a much better agreement with the observations

hardness-fluence correlations. We also compute time lags between profiles in
different energy channels and we find that they decrease with increasing

Gamma, we estimate the expected thermal emission of the relativistic wind when

rather bright thermal emission that could easily be detected. This favors
acceleration mechanisms for the wind where the main energy reservoir is under

ingredient of the model is a new extensive empirical stellar spectral library
presented in Cenarro et al., which is composed of more than 600 stars. Two main
products of interest for stellar population analysis are presented. The first
is a library of SEDs for SSPs covering a large range of ages, metallicities and
different IMF types. They are well suited to model galaxy data, since the SSP
spectra, with flux-calibrated response curves, can be smoothed to match the
resolution of galaxy data, taking into account the internal velocity dispersion
of the galaxy, allowing the user to analyze the observed spectrum in its own
system. We also produce integrated absorption line indices for the same SSPs in
the form of equivalent widths. We find the following behaviour for the CaII
feature in old-aged SSPs: i) the CaII triplet feature does not change much with
time for all metallicities for ages larger than ~3 Gyr, ii) this index shows a
strong dependence with metallicity for values below [M/H] ~-0.5 and iii) for
larger metallicities this feature does not show a significant dependence either
on age or on the metallicity, being more sensitive to changes in the slope of
power-like IMF shapes. The SSP spectra have been calibrated with measurements
for globular clusters. Fitting the models to two early-type galaxies of
different luminosities, we find that the CaII measurements cannot be fitted

fully-ordered model of the crystal structure (no split sites) is marginal at

description of the crystal structure below 250K is given in terms of two split
Ba sites, with random occupancies, for two out of three types of cages present

a simple model for this transition, based on temperature-induced de- trapping
of Ba from a deep double-well potential. This transition is associated with
sizeable anomalies in the transport and magnetic properties. The most
significant of these effects, that is, the drop in electrical conductivity on
cooling, can be easily explained within our model through the enhanced
structural disorder, which would affect the relaxation time for all portions of
the Fermi surface. We suggest that the other anomalies (increase in the

of the charge step is governed at low temperatures by the non-Fermi-liquid
fixed point of the two-channel Kondo effect. However, the associated Kondo
temperature TK is strongly modified. Most notably, TK is proportional to the
width of the level if the transmission through the impurity is close to unity

effective theory might have come from a compactification of a higher
dimensional space. Here, this problem is approached from the ground up by
considering theories with multiple interacting massive gravitons. It is
actually very difficult to construct discrete gravitational dimensions which
have a local continuum limit. In fact, any model with only nearest neighbor
interactions is doomed. If we could find a non-linear extension for the
Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian for a graviton of mass mg which does not break down
until the scale Lambda_2=(mg Mpl)^(1/2), this could be used to construct a
large class of models whose continuum limit is local in the extra dimension.
But this is shown to be impossible: a theory with a single graviton must break
down by Lambda_3 = (mg^2 Mpl)^(1/3). Next, we look at how the discretization
prescribed by the truncation of the KK tower of an honest extra diemsinon
rasies the scale of strong coupling. It dictates an intricate set of
interactions among various fields which conspire to soften the strongest
scattering amplitudes and allow for a local continuum limit. A number of
canditate symmetries associated with locality in the discretized dimension are
also discussed.

helicity is the fact that the fibre degrees of freedom of the covariant and
canonical representations do not coincide. We use massless relativistic wave
equations as constraint equations reducing the fibre degrees of freedom of the
covariant representation. They are characterized by invariant (and in contrast
with the massive case non reducing) one-dimensional projections. The definition

distinguished elements of the intertwiner space between E(2) (the two-fold

(mean) Cartan torsion, the (mean) Landsberg curvature and the S-curvature,
which all vanish for Riemannian metrics. It is important to understand the
geometric meanings of these quantities. In this paper, we study Finsler metrics
of scalar curvature (i.e., the flag curvature is a scalar function on the slit
tangent bundle) and partially determine the flag curvature when certain
non-Riemannian quantities are isotropic. Using the obtained formula for the
flag curvature, we classify locally projectively flat Randers metrics with
isotropic S-curvature.

$u_m\equiv 1$ in a group $G$ for all $m>k$. We are looking for an explicit
correct sequence of words $u_1(x,y),...,u_n(x,y),...$ such that a group $G$ is
solvable if and only if for some $n$ the word $u_n$ is an identity in $G$.

  Urbana-Champaign)","Connecting the geometric measure of entanglement and entanglement
  witnesses","3 pages, 1 figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The geometric measure of entanglement is an approach to quantifying
entanglement that is based on the Hilbert-space distance (or, equivalently,
angle) between pure states and their best unentangled approximants. An
entanglement witness is an operator that reveals entanglement for a given
entangled state. A connection is identified between entanglement witnesses and
the geometric measure of entanglement. This offers a new interpretation of the
geometric measure of entanglement of a state, and renders it experimentally
verifiable, doing so most readily for states that are pure.

Starting from a physical effect to illustrate the main ideas we will introduce
quantum random walks, review some of their properties and outline their
striking differences to classical walks. We will touch upon both physical
effects and computer science applications, introducing some of the main
concepts and language of present day quantum information science in this
context. We will mention recent developments in this new area and outline some
open questions.

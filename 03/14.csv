formation. This model includes the effects of turbulence in the initial state
of the gas, and has binary orbital parameters consistent with observation. Our
fundamental assumption is that the angular momenta of binary star systems is
directly related to the net angular momentum induced by turbulence in parent
molecular cloud cores. The primary results of this model are as follows. (i) A
quantitative prediction of the initial width of the binary period distribution
($\sigma_{\log {P}_d} = 1.6 - 2.1$ for a star formation efficiency in the range
$\epsilon_* = 0.1 - 0.9$). (ii) A robust, negative anticorrelation of binary
period and mass ratio. (iii) A robust, positive correlation of binary period
and eccentricity. (iv) A robust prediction that the binary separation of
low-mass systems should be more closely separated than those of solar-mass or
larger. These predictions are in good agreement with observations of PMS binary
systems with periods $P > 10^3$ d, which account for the majority of all
binaries.
  We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our results for
observational and theoretical studies of multiple star formation.

techniques because it does not require a second telescope, is almost
independent of the atmospheric conditions, and avoids triangulation problems in
determining the height. In the long term, regular monitoring using this method
would allow a valuable database of sodium layer profiles, heights, and return

astronomers to schedule observations optimally. In this paper we describe the

observed systems may have descended from IMXBs. Distributions at the current
epoch of the orbital periods, donor masses, and mass accretion rates have been
computed, as have orbital-period distributions of BMPs. Several significant
discrepancies between the theoretical and observed distributions are discussed.
The orbital-period distribution of observed BMPs strongly favors cases where
the envelope of the neutron-star progenitor is more easily ejected during the
common-envelope phase. However, this leads to a >~100-fold overproduction of
the theoretical number of luminous X-ray sources relative to the total observed
number of LMXBs. X-ray irradiation of the donor star may result in a dramatic
reduction in the X-ray active lifetime of L/IMXBs, thus possibly resolving the
overproduction problem, as well as the long-standing BMP/LMXB birthrate
problem.

LyA forest may be used to probe the nature of the sources. We show that the
attenuation of Lyman continuum photons by the IGM depends sensitively on the
emissivity of the sources, permitting a strong constraint to be set on the
required emissivity to match the measured values of the mean IGM LyA optical
depth. We also investigate the effect of fluctuations in the UV background. We
derive the distribution function of the background radiation field produced by
discrete sources in an infinite universe, including the effects of attenuation
by an intervening absorbing medium. We show that for z > 5, the fluctuations
boost the mean LyA optical depth in a scenario in which QSO sources dominate
the UV background. The fluctuations will also result in large spatial
correlations in the ionization level of the IGM at high redshifts, providing a
means of discriminating between scenarios in which stars and galaxies dominate
the UV background vs a QSO-dominated background.

through Ratra-Peebles or SUGRA potentials, and DE with constant negative
w=p\rho >-1. We find that at redshift zero the nonlinear power spectrum of the
dark matter, and the mass function of halos, practically do not depend on DE
state equation and are almost indistinguishable from predictions of the LCDM
model. This is consistent with the nonlinear analysis presented in the
accompanying paper. It is also a welcome feature because LCDM models fit a
large variety of data. On the other hand, at high redshifts DE models show
substantial differences from LCDM and substantial differences among themselves.
Halo profiles differ even at z=0. DE halos are denser than LCDM in their
central parts because the DE halos collapse earlier. Nevertheless, differences
between the models are not so large. For example, the density at 10 kpc of a DE
\~10^{13}Msun halo deviates from LCDM by not more than 50%. This, however,
means that DE is not a way to ease the problem with cuspy dark matter profiles.
Addressing another cosmological problem - abundance of subhalos -- we find that
the number of satellites of halos in various DE models does not change relative
to the LCDM, when normalized to the same circular velocity of the parent halo.
To summarize, the best way to find which DE model fits the observed Universe is
to look for evolution of halo properties. For example, the abundance of galaxy
groups with mass larger than 10^{13}\Msun at z> 2 can be used to discriminate
between the models, and, thus, to constrain the nature of DE.

find that the disruption of satellite galaxies in orbits roughly coplanar with
the disk leads naturally to the formation of ring-like stellar structures
similar to that recently discovered in the outer disk of the Milky Way. Two
interpretations appear plausible in this context. One is that the ring is a
transitory, localized radial density enhancement reflecting the apocenter of
particles stripped from a satellite during a recent pericentric passage (a
``tidal arc'' reminiscent of the tidal arms seen in disk galaxy mergers). In
the second scenario, the ring is analogous to the ``shells'' found around some
elliptical galaxies, and would result from a minor merger that took place
several Gyr ago. The two interpretations differ in several ways. Tidal arcs are
expected to span a limited longitude range; may carry a substantial fraction of
the original mass of the satellite; should exhibit a significant velocity
gradient with Galactic longitude; and are in all likelihood asymmetric above
and below the plane of the disk. Shells, on the other hand, may comprise at
most a small fraction of the original mass of the satellite and, due to their
more relaxed state, ought to be symmetric above and below the plane, with no
discernible velocity gradients across the structure. If confirmed as a tidal
feature, the ring discovered by SDSS in the outer Galactic disk would
strengthen the view--supported by numerical simulations--that minor mergers
have played a significant role building up not only the stellar halo, but also
the disk components of the Galaxy.

them to be in the range 10^{16-17} cm^-2. The properties of these absorbers are
similar to those of the 3C 273 absorber studied by Tripp et al. However, the
inferred line-of-sight size for the 3C 273 absorber is only 70 pc, much smaller
than those inferred in RX J1230.8+0115, which are 10-30 h_70 kpc. The small
sizes of all three absorbers are at odds with the >~350 h_70 kpc minimum
transverse size implied by an application of the standard QSO line pairs
analysis. On the basis of absorber associations between these two sight lines
we conclude that a large-scale structure filament produces a correlated, not
contiguous, gaseous structure in this region of the Virgo Supercluster. These
data may indicate that we are detecting overdensities in the large scale
structure filaments in this region. Alternatively, the presence of a galaxy 71

The cluster has a cool dense core; the radial temperature gradient varies with

0335+096 hosts a cold front at r\approx 40kpc south of the center. The gas
pressure across the front is discontinuous by a factor A_P=1.6\pm 0.3,
indicating that the cool core is moving with respect to the ambient gas with a
Mach number M\approx 0.75\pm 0.2. The central dense region inside the cold
front shows an unusual X-ray morphology, which consists of a number of X-ray
blobs and/or filaments on scales \gtrsim 3kpc, along with two prominent X-ray
cavities. The X-ray blobs are not correlated with either the optical line
emission (H\alpha+[NII]), member galaxies or radio emission. Deprojected
temperature of the dense blobs is consistent with that of the less dense
ambient gas, so these gas phases do not appear to be in thermal pressure
equilibrium. An interesting possibility is a significant, unseen non-thermal
pressure component in the inter-blob gas, possibly arising from the activity of
the central AGN. We discuss two models for the origin of the gas blobs --
hydrodynamic instabilities caused by the observed motion of the gas core, or
``bubbling'' of the core caused by multiple outbursts of the central AGN.

find that for a Jupiter-mass planet the signatures of the central star can be
detected with fractional deviations of > 5% from the best-fitting single-lens

amount of Halpha emission that arises from the diffuse ionized gas is about
15-30% of the total Halpha flux for a typical UCM galaxy. This percentage seems
to be independent of the Hubble type. Conversely, we found that an `average'
UCM galaxy harbours a star formation event with 30% of its Halpha luminosity
arising from a nuclear component. The implications of these results for
higher-redshift studies are discussed, including the effects of galaxy size and
the depth of the observations. A correlation between the SFR and the Balmer
decrement is observed, but such correlation breaks down for large values of the
extinction. Finally, we recalculate the Halpha luminosity function and star
formation rate density of the local Universe using the new imaging data. Our
results point out that, on average, spectroscopic observations detected about

SBF amplitudes are powerful diagnostics for the morphology of the Horizontal

reliable SBF evaluations. The SBF measurements are used to give robust
constraints on the evolution of AGB stars, suggesting that mass loss activity
on AGB stars should be twice more efficient than on the RGB stars. Our models
are able to reproduce the absolute SBF magnitudes of the Galactic Globular
Clusters and of galaxies, and their integrated colors. New calibrations of
absolute SBF magnitude in $V$, $R$, $I$, and $K$ photometric filters are
provided, which appear reliable enough to directly gauge distances bypassing
other distance indicators. The SBF technique is also used as stellar population
tracer to derive age and metallicity of a selected sample of galaxies of known

the mass-velocity relation for the swept-up gas is a single power-law, with a
shallow slope $\simeq -1.5$ and no break to a steeper slope at high velocities.
An analytic bowshock model with no post-shock mixing is shown to reproduce this
behaviour very well.
  We show that molecular dissociation and the temperature dependence of the
line emissivity are both critical in defining the shape of the line profiles at
velocities above $\sim$ 20 km s$^{-1}$. In particular, the simulated CO J=2-1
intensity-velocity relation does show a break in slope, even though the
underlying mass distribution does not. These predicted CO profiles are found to
compare remarkably well with observations of molecular outflows, both in terms
of the slopes at low and high velocities and in terms of the range of break
velocities at which the change in slope occurs. Shallower slopes are predicted
at high velocity in higher excitation lines, such as H$_2$ S(1)1-0.
  This work indicates that, in jet-driven outflows, the CO J=2-1 intensity
profile reflects the slope of the underlying mass-velocity distribution only at
velocities $\le $ 20 km/s, and that higher temperature tracers are required to
probe the mass distribution at higher speed.

with the changing accretion rates of cold gas onto the central massive black
holes that power the quasars. We base on galaxy interactions as main triggers
of accretion; the related scaling laws are taken up from Cavaliere & Vittorini
(2000), and grafted to a semi-analytic code for galaxy formation. As a result,
at high $z$ the protogalaxies grow rapidly by hierarchical merging; meanwhile,
much fresh gas is imported and also destabilized, so the holes are fueled at
their full Eddington rates. At lower $z$ the galactic dynamical events are
mostly encounters in hierarchically growing groups; now the refueling peters
out, as the residual gas is exhausted while the destabilizing encounters
dwindle. So, with no parameter tuning other than needed for stellar
observables, our model uniquely produces at $z>3$ a rise, and at $z\lesssim 2.5
$ a decline of the bright quasar population as steep as observed. In addition,
our results closely fit the observed luminosity functions of quasars, their
space density at different magnitudes from $z\approx 5$ to $z\approx 0$, and
the local $m_{BH}-\sigma$ relation.

there is a crossover to the classical regime with an energy gap given by the

equilibrium concepts, a stochastic collision model is investigated. We consider
the dynamics of a tracer particle of mass $M$, undergoing elastic collisions
with ideal gas particles of mass $m$, in the Rayleigh limit $m<<M$. The
probability density function (PDF) of the gas particle velocity is
$f(\tilde{v}_m)$. Assuming a uniform collision rate and molecular chaos, we
obtain the equilibrium distribution for the velocity of the tracer particle
$W_{eq}(V_M)$. Depending on asymptotic properties of $f(\tilde{v}_m)$ we find
that $W_{eq}(V_M)$ is either the Maxwell velocity distribution or a L\'evy
distribution. In particular our results yield a generalized Maxwell
distribution based on L\'evy statistics using two approaches. In the first a
thermodynamic argument is used, imposing on the dynamics the condition that
equilibrium properties of the heavy tracer particle be independent of the
coupling $\epsilon=m/M$ to the gas particles, similar to what is found for a
Brownian particle in a fluid. This approach leads to a generalized temperature
concept. In the second approach it is assumed that bath particles velocity PDF
scales with an energy scale, i.e. the (nearly) ordinary temperature, as found
in standard statistical mechanics. The two approaches yield different types of
L\'evy equilibrium which merge into a unique solution only for the
Maxwell--Boltzmann case. Thus, relation between thermodynamics and statistical
mechanics becomes non-trivial for the power law case. Finally, the relation of
the kinetic model to fractional Fokker--Planck equations is discussed.

dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a Si/SiGe heterostructure at zero magnetic
field. On going through the MIT we observe the corresponding evolution of the
magnetic field induced transition between the insulating phase and the quantum
Hall (QH) liquid state in the QH regime. Similar to the previous reports for a
GaAs sample, we find that the critical magnetic field needed to produce the
transition becomes zero at the critical electron density corresponding to the
zero field MIT. The temperature dependence of the conductivity in a
metallic-like state at zero field is compared with the theory of the
interaction corrections at intermediate and ballistic regimes
$k_{B}T\tau/\hbar\geq1$. The theory yields a good fit for the linear part of
the curve. However the slope of that part of $\sigma_{xx}(T)$ is about two
times smaller than that reported in other 2D systems with similar values of
$r_s$. At the same time, the recent theory of magnetoresistance due to
electron-electron interaction in the case of arbitrary $k_{B}T\tau/\hbar$,
smooth disorder and classically strong fields does not seem to be quite
adequate for the description of the parabolic magnetoresistance observed in our
samples. We attribute these results to the fact that neither of these theories
deals with the whole scattering potential in a sample but leaves either its
long range or its short range component out of consideration.

two delta peaks, which are completely out of equilibrium with each other. The
statistics of the positions and weights of these delta peaks over the samples
allows to obtain explicit results for all observables in the limit $T \to 0$.
We first compute disorder averages of one-time observables, such as the
diffusion front, the thermal width, the localization parameters, the
two-particle correlation function, and the generating function of thermal
cumulants of the position. We then study aging and sub-aging effects : our
approach reproduces very simply the two different aging exponents and yields
explicit forms for scaling functions of the various two-time correlations. We
also extend the RSRG method to include systematic corrections to the previous
zero temperature procedure via a series expansion in $T$. We then consider the
generalized trap model with parameter $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and obtain that the
large scale effective model at low temperature does not depend on $\alpha$ in
any dimension, so that the only observables sensitive to $\alpha$ are those
that measure the `local persistence', such as the probability to remain exactly
in the same trap during a time interval. Finally, we extend our approach at a
scaling level for the trap model in $d=2$ and obtain the two relevant time
scales for aging properties.

unfolding is done in two separate steps. Firstly, it is shown that partial
stable models can be captured by total stable models using a simple linear and
modular program transformation. Hence, reasoning tasks concerning partial
stable models can be solved using an implementation of total stable models.
Disjunctive partial stable models have been lacking implementations which now
become available as the translation handles also the disjunctive case.
Secondly, it is shown how total stable models of disjunctive programs can be
determined by computing stable models for normal programs. Hence, an
implementation of stable models of normal programs can be used as a core engine
for implementing disjunctive programs. The feasibility of the approach is
demonstrated by constructing a system for computing stable models of
disjunctive programs using the smodels system as the core engine. The
performance of the resulting system is compared to that of dlv which is a

conformally-invariant (CI) scaling curves, in the plane or half-plane. It
focuses on deriving critical exponents associated with interacting random
paths, by exploiting an underlying quantum gravity (QG) structure, which uses
KPZ maps relating exponents in the plane to those on a random lattice, i.e., in
a fluctuating metric. This is applied to critical models, like O(N) and Potts
models, and to the Stochastic L\""owner Evolution (SLE). The multifractal (MF)
function f(alpha, c) of the harmonic measure near any CI fractal boundary, is
given as a function of the central charge c of the associated CFT. The
Hausdorff dimensions D_{H} of a non-simple scaling curve or cluster hull, and
D_{EP} of its external perimeter or frontier, are shown to obey the duality
equation (D_{H}-1)(D_{EP}-1)=1/4, valid for any c. The universal mixed MF
spectrum f(alpha,lambda;c) describing the local spiralling rate lambda and
singularity exponent alpha of the potential near any CI scaling curve is given.
The duality between simple and non-simple random paths is established via a
symmetry of the KPZ quantum gravity map. An extended dual KPZ relation is
introduced for the SLE_{kappa}, which commutes with the kappa to
kappa'=16/kappa duality. This gives the SLE exponents from simple QG rules,
established from the general structure of correlation functions of arbitrary
interacting random sets on a random lattice.

(Theorem 17), Murre's Conjecture for a suitable m-fold product of X by itself
implies finite dimensionality of M(X). We also show (Theorem 27) that, for a

nonlinear Schr{\""o}dinger equations, which model multimode wave propagation
under varied physical situations in nonlinear optics, are studied. In this
paper, by explicitly constructing multisoliton solutions (upto four-soliton
solutions) for two coupled and arbitrary $N$-coupled nonlinear Schr{\""o}dinger
equations using the Hirota bilinearization method, we bring out clearly the
various features underlying the fascinating shape changing (intensity
redistribution) collisions of solitons, including changes in amplitudes, phases
and relative separation distances, and the very many possibilities of energy
redistributions among the modes of solitons. However in this multisoliton
collision process the pair-wise collision nature is shown to be preserved in
spite of the changes in the amplitudes and phases of the solitons. Detailed
asymptotic analysis also shows that when solitons undergo multiple collisions,
there exists the exciting possibility of shape restoration of atleast one
soliton during interactions of more than two solitons represented by three and
higher order soliton solutions. From application point of view, we have shown
from the asymptotic expressions how the amplitude (intensity) redistribution
can be written as a generalized linear fractional transformation for the
$N$-component case. Also we indicate how the multisolitons can be reinterpreted
as various logic gates for suitable choices of the soliton parameters, leading
to possible multistate logic. In addition, we point out that the various
recently studied partially coherent solitons are just special cases of the
bright soliton solutions exhibiting shape changing collisions, thereby
explaining their variable profile and shape variation in collision process.

  misinterpretation of what the paper does and does not treat. PACS numbers
  changed",,,,"quant-ph gr-qc",,"  This work is based on the idea that extension of physical and mathematical
theories to include the amount of space, time, momentum, and energy resources
required to determine properties of systems may influence what is true in
physics and mathematics at a foundational level. Background material, on the
dependence of region or system sizes on both the resources required to study
the regions or systems and the indirectness of the reality status of the
systems, suggests that one associate to each amount, r, of resources a domain,
D_{r}, a theory, T_{r}, and a language, L_{r}. D_{r} is limited in that all
statements in D_{r} require at most r resources to verify or refute. T_{r} is
limited in that any theorem of T_{r} must be provable using at most r
resources. Also any theorem of T_{r} must be true in D_{r}. L_{r} is limited in
that all expressions in L_{r} require at most r resources to create, display,
and maintain. A partial ordering of the resources is used to describe minimal
use of resources, a partial ordering of the T_{r}, and motion of an observer
using resources to acquire knowledge. Reflection principles are used to push
the effect of Godel's incompleteness theorem on consistency up in the partial
ordering. It is suggested that a coherent theory of physics and mathematics, or
theory of everything, is a common extension of all the T_{r}.

Lett. 91, 107903 (2003)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.107903",,"quant-ph",,"  We introduce a class of multiparticle entanglement purification protocols
that allow us to distill a large class of entangled states. These include
cluster states, GHZ states and various error correction codes all of which
belong to the class of two-colorable graph states. We analyze these schemes
under realistic conditions and observe that they are scalable, i.e. the
threshold value for imperfect local operations does not depend on the number of
parties for many of these states. When compared to schemes based on bipartite
entanglement purification, the protocol is more efficient and the achievable
quality of the purified states is larger. As an application we discuss an
experimental realization of the protocol in optical lattices which allows one
to purify cluster states.

Mechanical lattice of projections over some separable Hilbert space. The basic
ingredient of the construction is the rule of indistinguishability of Standard
and some Nonstandard models of Peano Arithmetic. The ingeneric reals introduced
by M. Ozawa will correspond to simultaneous measurement of incompatible
observables. We also discuss some results concerning model theoretical analysis
of Small Exotic Smooth Structures on topological 4-space. Forcing appears
rather naturally in this context and the rule of indistinguishability is
crucial again. As an unexpected application we are able to approach Maldacena
Conjecture on $AdS/CFT$ correspondence in the case of AdS_5xS^5 and Super YM
Conformal Field Theory in 4 dimensions. We conjecture that there is possibility
of breaking Supersymetry via sources of gravity generated in 4 dimensions by
exotic smooth structures on R^4 emerging in this context.

overcomplete families of states and generalizing the Klauder and the
Berezin-Toeplitz approaches. This scheme could reveal itself as an efficient
tool for quantizing physical systems for which more traditional methods like
geometric quantization are uneasy to implement. The procedure is illustrated by
(mostly two-dimensional) elementary examples in which the measure space is a
$N$-element set and the unit interval. Spaces of states for the $N$-element set
and the unit interval are the 2-dimensional euclidean $\R^2$ and hermitian
$\C^2$ planes.

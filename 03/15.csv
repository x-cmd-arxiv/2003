This gives a lower limit to the thermal conductivity and therefore to the

millimeter sky, based on an analysis of the WMAP data combined with several
templates of dust emission (DIRBE/COBE and FIRAS/COBE) and gas tracers (HI and
Halpha). To study the IR to millimeter properties of the diffuse sky at high
galactic latitude, we concentrate on the emission correlated with the HI gas.
We compute the emission spectrum of the dust/free-free/synchrotron components
associated with HI gas from low to large column densities. A significant
residual WMAP emission over the free-free, synchrotron and the dust
contribution is found from 3.2 to 9.1 mm. We show that this residual WMAP
emission (normalised to 10$^{20}$ atoms/cm$^2$) (1) exhibits a constant
spectrum from 3.2 to 9.1 mm and (2) significantly decreases in amplitude when
N$_{HI}$ increases, contrary to the HI-normalised far-infrared emission which
stays rather constant. It is thus very likely that the residual WMAP emission
is not associated with the Large Grain dust component. The decrease in
amplitude with increasing opacity ressembles in fact to the decrease of the
transiently heated dust grain emission observed in dense interstellar clouds.
This is supported by an observed decrease of the HI-normalised 60 microns
emission with HI column densities. Although this result should be interpreted
with care due to zodiacal residual contamination at 60 microns, it suggests
that the WMAP excess emission is associated with the small transiently heated
dust particles. On the possible models of this so-called ``anomalous microwave
emission'' linked to the small dust particles are the spinning dust and the
excess millimeter emission of the small grains, due to the cold temperatures
they can reach between two successive impacts with photons.

known to be discrepant with current theoretical expectations. This result
derives from a comparison of several cluster samples to predictions in the
framework of the currently favored $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and one possible
explanation for the discrepancy is that this cosmological model is not correct.
In this paper we discuss the incidence of giant arcs in the Red-Sequence
Cluster Survey (RCS), which again shows significant disagreement with
theoretical predictions. We briefly describe a total of eight strong lens
systems, seven of which are discussed here for the first time. Based on the
details of these systems, in particular on the ratio of single to multiple arc
systems, we argue that it may be possible to explain this discrepancy in the
currently favored cosmology, by modifying the details of the lenses themselves.
Specifically, the high incidence of multiple arc systems and their overall high
redshift suggests that a sub-population of the global cluster population is
responsible for much of the observed lensing. The lack of lensing clusters at
$z<0.64$ in the RCS indicates that a property associated with clusters at early
times results in the boosted lensing cross sections; likely a combination of
ellipticity and elongation along the line of sight, substructure, and changes
in the cluster mass profiles is responsible. Cluster mass, which should evolve
to globally higher values toward lower redshifts, is clearly not the most
significant consideration for the formation of giant arcs.

clusters. Around 30 percent of stars lose their discs within 1 Myr, while the
remainder have disc lifetimes that are typically in the 1-10 Myr range. We show
that the latter range of ages is consistent with theoretical models for disc
evolution, provided that there is a dispersion of around 0.5 in the log of the
initial disc mass. The same range of initial conditions brackets the observed
variation in the accretion rate of Classical T Tauri stars at a given age. We
discuss the expected lifetime of discs in close binary systems, and show that
our models predict that the disc lifetime is almost constant for separations
exceeding 10 au. This implies a low predicted fraction of binaries that pair a

agreement with observations of the disc lifetime in binaries than disc models

populations as a function of mass, environment and morphology. In this first
paper our emphasis is on presenting the evolutionary population synthesis
models. Lower-sigma galaxies exhibit a substantially greater intrinsic scatter,
in a variety of line strength indicators, than do higher-sigma galaxies, with
the large intrinsic scatter setting in below a sigma of 100 km/s. Modeling of
the observed spectral indices indicates that the strong Balmer lines found
primarily among the low-sigma galaxies are caused by young age, rather than by
low metallicity. Thus we find a trend between the population age and the
velocity dispersion, such that low sigma galaxies have younger
luminosity-weighted mean ages. We have repeated this analysis using several
different Balmer lines, and find consistent results from one spectral indicator
to another.

the stated order. Here, to test out these claims and counterclaims, we
calculate the time delay in the limit of an instantaneous gravitational force,

conclude that the speed of gravity cannot be determined by measuring these

quasars in the high redshift Universe. The reason that all radio galaxies are
found in such hosts may be the correlation of black hole mass with radio
luminosity, but it is emphasized that accretion rate too plays an important
role in the production of powerful radio jets. The tight K-z relation of
luminous, high redshift, radio galaxies is probably a selection effect due to
the selection on high black hole masses and high accretion rates. Luminous
radio galaxies are the radio-loud part of the ``quasar-2'' population, and the
ratio of radio-loud quasars to luminous radio galaxies, about 1:1, is so far
our only good estimate of the relative numbers of quasar-1s and quasar-2s. The
numbers of radio-quiet and radio-intermediate quasar-2s are still uncertain,
but a much larger population than the quasar-1s would conflict with constraints
from the present-day black hole mass density. A comparison of the number
densities of dark matter haloes and the high redshift quasars, however,
suggests that there are plenty of dark haloes capable of hosting the known high

static magnetic field. Without Coulomb interaction, the field induces, for
particular values, points of degeneracy where a change of ground state takes
place due to Aharonov-Bohm effect. The Coulomb potential introduces interaction
between the electronic configurations. As a consequence, when there is
degeneracy, the ground state of the system becomes a many body state - unable
to be described by a mean-field theory - and a gap is opened. To study this
problem, we propose a variational multireference wave function which goes
beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation. Using this ansatz, in addition to the
avoided crossing formation, two other effects of the electron-electron
interaction are pointed out: (i) the long-range part of the Coulomb potential
tends to shift the position in magnetic field of the (avoided) crossing points
and, (ii) at the points of (near) degeneracy, the interaction can drive the
system from a singlet to a triplet state inducing new real crossing points in
the ground state energy curve as function of the field. Such crossings should
appear in various experiments as sudden changes in the response of the system

modes in the normal state from the relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$. One gives rise
to an activation-type component in $T_1^{-1}$, and the other $T$-linear

arises from free motion of holon-spinon bound states appearing by hole doping,

typical cases of DMS's: The cases with strong and moderate exchange
interactions in the absence of nonmagnetic potentials, and the case with strong
attractive nonmagnetic potentials in addition to moderate exchange interaction.
When the exchange interaction is sufficiently strong, magnetic impurity bands
split from the host band. Carriers in the magnetic impurity band mainly stay at
magnetic sites, and coupling between the carrier spin and the localized spin is
very strong. The hopping of the carriers among the magnetic sites causes
ferromagnetism through a {\it double-exchange (DE)-like} mechanism. We have
investigated the condition for the DE-like mechanism to operate in DMS's. The
result reveals that the nonmagnetic attractive potential at the magnetic site
assists the formation of the magnetic impurity band and makes the DE-like
mechanism operative by substantially enhancing the effect of the exchange
interaction. Using conventional parameters we have studied the carrier states
in Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$As. The result shows that the ferromagnetism is caused

and debugging, software faults persist even in commercial grade software. Many
distributed systems, especially those employed in safety-critical environments,
should be able to operate properly even in the presence of software faults.
Monitoring the execution of a distributed system, and, on detecting a fault,
initiating the appropriate corrective action is an important way to tolerate
such faults. This gives rise to the predicate detection problem which requires
finding a consistent cut of a given computation that satisfies a given global
predicate, if it exists.
  Detecting a predicate in a computation is, however, an NP-complete problem.
To ameliorate the associated combinatorial explosion problem, we introduce the
notion of computation slice. Formally, the slice of a computation with respect
to a predicate is a (sub)computation with the least number of consistent cuts
that contains all consistent cuts of the computation satisfying the predicate.
To detect a predicate, rather than searching the state-space of the
computation, it is much more efficient to search the state-space of the slice.
  We prove that the slice exists and is uniquely defined for all predicates. We
present efficient slicing algorithms for several useful classes of predicates.
We develop efficient heuristic algorithms for computing an approximate slice
for predicates for which computing the slice is otherwise provably intractable.
Our experimental results show that slicing can lead to an exponential
improvement over existing techniques for predicate detection in terms of time
and space.

from a set of current sources embedded in a homogeneous extracellular medium.
Although this formalism can successfully model several properties of LFPs, it
does not account for their frequency-dependent attenuation with distance, a
property essential to correctly model extracellular spikes. Here we derive
expressions for the extracellular potential that include this
frequency-dependent attenuation. We first show that, if the extracellular
conductivity is non-homogeneous, there is induction of non-homogeneous charge
densities which may result in a low-pass filter. We next derive a simplified
model consisting of a punctual (or spherical) current source with
spherically-symmetric conductivity/permittivity gradients around the source. We
analyze the effect of different radial profiles of conductivity and
permittivity on the frequency-filtering behavior of this model. We show that
this simple model generally displays low-pass filtering behavior, in which fast
electrical events (such as Na$^+$-mediated action potentials) attenuate very
steeply with distance, while slower (K$^+$-mediated) events propagate over
larger distances in extracellular space, in qualitative agreement with
experimental observations. This simple model can be used to obtain
frequency-dependent extracellular field potentials without taking into account
explicitly the complex folding of extracellular space.

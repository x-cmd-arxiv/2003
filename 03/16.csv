Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect are systematically low in comparison to values

isothermal $\beta$ model for the intracluster medium (ICM). We present the
results of a statistical analysis of {\em temperature bias} in $H_0$
determinations in a sample of 27 numerically simulated X-ray clusters drawn
from a $\Lambda$CDM model at z=0.5. We employ adaptive mesh refinement to
provide high resolution (15.6 h$^{-1} kpc$) in cluster cores which dominate the
X-ray and radio signals. Fitting synthetic X-ray and y-parameter maps to the
standard isothermal beta model, we find a broad, skewed distribution in
$f\equiv H_0(SZ)/H_0(actual)$ with a mean, median, and standard deviation of
0.89, 0.83 and 0.32 respectively, where $H_0(SZ)$ is the value of $H_0$ derived
by using Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect method and $H_0(actual)$ is the value used in
the cosmological simulation. We find that the clusters' declining temperature
profiles systematically lower estimates of $H_0$ by 10% to 20%. The declining
temperature profile of our adiabatic system is consistent with the result
including radiative cooling and supernovae feedback (Loken et al. 2002). We
thereby introduce a non-isothermal $\beta$ model as an improvement. Applying
the non-isothermal $\beta$ model to the refined sample with well-fitted
temperature profile, the value of f improves 9% relative to the actual value.
The study of the morphology and the clumping effects conclude that these two
factors combine to induce scatter in f of $\pm$ 30 %.

We prove that the existence of a quasi-regular sequence in either the original

singularities: given a pure morphism $Y\to X$ between affine $\mathbb
Q$-Gorenstein varieties of finite type over $\mathbb C$, if $Y$ has at most a
log-terminal singularities, then so does $X$. The second application is the
Vanishing for Maps of Tor for log-terminal singularities: if $A\subset R$ is a

microscopic aspects of hydration phenomena. One common view is that extending
those experimental studies to larger cluster sizes would give the single ion
absolute hydration free energies not obtainable by classical thermodynamic
methods. This issue is reanalyzed in the context of recent computations and
molecular theories on ion hydration, particularly considering the hydration of
H$^+$, Li$^+$, Na$^+$, and HO$^-$ ions and thence the hydration of neutral ion
pairs. The hydration free energies of neutral pairs computed here are in good
agreement with experimental results, whereas the calculated absolute hydration
free energies, and the excess chemical potentials, deviate consistently from
some recently tabulated hydration free energies based on ion-water cluster
data. We show how the single ion absolute hydration free energies are not
separated from the potential of the phase in recent analyses of ion-water
cluster data, even in the limit of large cluster sizes. We conclude that naive
calculations on ion-water clusters ought to agree with results obtained from
experimental studies of ion-water clusters because both values include the
contribution, somewhat extraneous to the local environment of the ion, from the
potential of the phase.

structure from an incomplete image using the extended Potts mode with a pinned
lattice we introduced in a previous paper. The initial information consists of
the positions of the vertices only. We locate the centers of the bubbles using
the Euclidean distance-map construction and assign at each vertex position a
continuous pinning field with a potential falling off as $1/r$. We nucleate a
bubble at each center using the extended Potts model and let the structure
evolve under the constraint of scaled target areas until the bubbles contact
each other. The target area constraint and pinning centers prevent further
coarsening. We then turn the area constraint off and let the edges relax to a
minimum energy configuration. The result is a reconstructed structure very
close to the simulation. We repeated this procedure for various stages of the
coarsening of the same simulated foam and investigated the simulation and
reconstruction dynamics, topology and area distribution, finding that they
agree to good accuracy.

particles immersed in a fluid. Such random motion of the particles is produced
by statistical fluctuations in the collisions they suffer with the molecules of
the surrounding fluid. Brownian motion of particles in a fluid (like milk
particles in water) can be observed under a microscope. Here we describe a
simple experimental set-up to observe Brownian motion and a method of
determining the diffusion coefficient of the Brownian particles, based on a
theory due to Smoluchowski. While looking through the microscope we focus
attention on a fixed small volume, and record the number of particles that are
trapped in that volume, at regular intervals of time. This gives us a
time-series data, which is enough to determine the diffusion coefficient of the
particles to a good degree of accuracy.

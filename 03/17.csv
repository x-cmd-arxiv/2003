investigated by comparing the properties of a sample of dwarf irregulars (dIs)
in the Virgo Cluster with a control sample of nearby (""field"") dIs having
oxygen abundances derived from [O III]4363 measurements and measured distances
from resolved stellar constituents. Spectroscopic data are obtained for H II
regions in 11 Virgo dIs distributed in the central and outer regions of the
cluster. To ensure that oxygen abundances are derived in a homogeneous manner,
oxygen abundances for field and Virgo dIs are computed using the bright-line
method and compared with abundances directly obtained from [O III]4363, where
available. They are found to agree to within about 0.2 dex with no systematic
offset. At a given optical luminosity, there is no systematic difference in
oxygen abundance between the sample of Virgo dIs and the sample of nearby dIs.
However, five of the eleven Virgo dIs exhibit much lower baryonic gas fractions
than field dIs at comparable oxygen abundances. Using field dIs as a reference,
a gas-deficiency index for dIs is constructed, making it possible
quantitatively to identify which galaxies have lost gas. For the Virgo sample,
some of the dwarfs are gas-deficient by a factor of 30. The gas-deficiency
correlates roughly with the X-ray surface brightness of the intracluster gas.
Ram-pressure stripping can best explain the observed gas-poor dIs in the
cluster sample. Together with the lack of significant fading and reddening of
the gas-poor dIs compared to gas-normal dIs, these observations suggest that
the gas-poor dIs in Virgo have recently encountered the intracluster medium for
the first time. Faded remnants of gas-poor dIs in Virgo will resemble bright
dwarf ellipticals presently seen in the cluster core.

distribution corresponds to the regular acceleration by an electromagnetic wave
in the vicinity of its Alfven resonance surface inside the jet. The
polarization properties of the radiation have been obtained and compared with
the existing VLBI polarization measurements of parsec-scale jets in BL Lac

bimodality in the alignment between the electric field vector of the polarized

interpret the motion of bright knots as a phase velocity of standing spiral
eigenmodes of electromagnetic perturbations in a cylindrical jet. The degree of

depend upon the angular rotational velocity of the jet. The observed
polarizations and velocities of knots indicate that the magnetic field lines

been recently discovered with Chandra by Corbel et al. (2002). We find that the
dynamical evolution of the eastern jet at the late time is consistent with the
well-known Sedov evolutionary phase. A trans-relativistic external shock
dynamic model by analogy with the evolution of gamma-ray burst remnants, is
shown to be able to fit the observation data reasonably well. The inferred
interstellar medium density around the source is well below the canonical value
$n_ISM \sim 1 cm^{-3}$. We find that the emission from the continuously shocked
interstellar medium (forward shock region) decays too slowly to be a viable
mechanism for the eastern X-ray jet. However, the rapidly fading X-ray emission
can be interpreted as synchrotron radiation from the non-thermal electrons in
the adiabatically expanding ejecta. These electrons were accelerated by the
reverse shock (moving back into the ejecta) which becomes important when the
inertia of the swept external matter leads to an appreciable slowing down of
the original ejecta. To ensure the dominance of the emission from the shocked
ejecta over that from the forward shock region during the period of the
observations, the magnetic field and electron energy fractions in the forward
shock region must be far below equipartition. Future continuous, follow-up
multi-wavelength observations of new ejection events from microquasars up to
the significant deceleration phase should provide more valuable insight into
the nature of the interaction between the jets and external medium.

them up to their observed, fast rotation. The lack of MSPs and LMXBs rotating
near break-up and the similar rotation periods of several LMXBs have been
attributed to the accretion torque being balanced, at fast rotation, by
gravitational radiation, perhaps caused by an oscillation mode made unstable
through the so-called Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz mechanism. Recently,
Wagoner has argued that internal dissipation through weak interaction processes
involving $\Lambda^0$ and $\Sigma^-$ hyperons may cause LMXBs to evolve into a
quasi-steady state, in which the neutron star has a nearly constant rotation
rate, temperature, and mode amplitude. We take this hypothesis one step
further, showing that MSPs descending from these LMXBs spend a long time in a
similar state, in which a low-amplitude r-mode turns them into extremely steady
sources of both gravitational waves and thermal X-rays, while they spin down
due to a combination of gravitational radiation and the standard magnetic
torque. Observed MSP braking torques already place meaningful constraints on
the allowed gravitational wave amplitudes and dissipation mechanisms.

  Specific heats of dilute Ne inside long (20, 20) SWNT are calculated at
different temperatures. It is found that Ne exhibits 3-dimensional (3D) gas
behavior at high temperature but behaves as 2D gas at low temperature.
Especially, at ultra low temperature, Ne inside (20, 20) nanotubes behaves as
lattice gas. A coarse method to determine the characteristic temperature
$\mathcal{T}_c$ for low density gas in a potential is put forward. If
$\mathcal{T}\gg \mathcal{T}_c$, we just need to use the classical statistical
mechanics without solving the Shr\""{o}dinger equation to consider the thermal
behavior of gas in the potential. But if $\mathcal{T}\sim \mathcal{T}_c$, we
must solve the Shr\""{o}dinger equation. For Ne in (20,20) nanotube, we obtain
$\mathcal{T}_c\approx 60$ K.

investigating the general problem of quantising a system whose `configuration

the issue based on the ""vector manifestation"" scenario discovered by Harada and
Yamawaki in hidden local symmetry theory. For simplicity, I will restrict
myself to two extreme scenarios: one that we shall refer to as ""standard"" in
which pions are considered to be the $only$ low-lying degrees of freedom and
the other that could be referred to as ""non-standard"" in which in addition to
pions, other degrees of freedom figure in the process. In particular, I shall
consider the scenario that arises at one-loop order in chiral perturbation
theory with hidden local symmetry Lagrangian consisting of pions as well as
nearly massless vector mesons that figure importantly at the ``vector
manifestation (VM)"" fixed point. It will be shown that if the VM is realized in
nature, the chiral phase structure of hadronic matter can be much richer than
that in the standard one and the chiral phase transition will be a smooth
crossover: Sharp vector and scalar excitations are expected in the vicinity of
the critical point. Some indirect indications that lend support to the VM
scenario are discussed.

electric coupling, 2) pure magnetic coupling, and 3) mixed electric and
magnetic charges (dyons). Schwinger first introduced dyons in a magnetic model
of matter. It is shown in this paper that recent data of new light mesons fit
into the CQ model (a pure electric model) without the introduction of magnetic
charges. However, by introducing electric and magnetic quarks (dyons) into the
CQ model, new dynamical forces can be generated by the presence of magnetic
fields internal to the quarks (dyons). The laws of angular momentum and of
energy conservation are valid in the presence of magnetic charge. With the
introduction of the Russell-Saunders coupling scheme into the CQ model, several

that axial torsion and torsion trace modes have non-transverse vacuum
polarization tensors, and become massive as a result. The underlying reasons
are similar to those responsible for the Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) and scaling
anomalies. Since these are the only torsion components that can couple
minimally to spin 1/2 particles, the anomalous generation of masses for these
modes, naturally of the order of the regulator scale, may help to explain why
torsion and its associated effects, including CPT violation in chiral gravity,
have so far escaped detection. As a simpler manifestation of the reasons
underpinning the ABJ anomaly than triangle diagrams, the vacuum polarization
demonstration is also pedagogically useful. In addition it is shown that the

forequency-dependent dissipations observed in such complex phenomena as
acoustic wave propagating through human tissues, sediments, and rock layers.

not use the counting of the flow lines, but rather the fundamental classes of
the stable manifolds, and this allows to replace the transversality condition
required in the classical setting by a weaker condition on the $f$-gradient

Morse complex is stable with respect to $C^0$-small perturbations of the

last two sections of the paper are devoted to the properties of functoriality

inputs, but at the same time indicate this failure.

  one-dimensional Hamiltonian systems","17 pages, 2 figures, textual improvements","J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 36, 9591 (2003).","10.1088/0305-4470/36/36/310",,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall nlin.CD",,"  For chaotic systems there is a theory for the decay of the survival
probability, and for the parametric dependence of the local density of states.
This theory leads to the distinction between ""perturbative"" and
""non-perturbative"" regimes, and to the observation that semiclassical tools are
useful in the latter case. We discuss what is ""left"" from this theory in the
case of one-dimensional systems. We demonstrate that the remarkably accurate
{\em uniform} semiclassical approximation captures the physics of {\em all} the
different regimes, though it cannot take into account the effect of strong
localization.

argue that the quantum state is just the representative of information
available to a given observer. Then Ryff's interpretation of one of our
experiments and our original one are both admissible.

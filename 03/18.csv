photons can become massive during inflation. Our account begins with a
discussion of the period of exponentially rapid expansion known as inflation.
We next describe how, when the universe is not expanding, quantum fluctuations
in charged particle fields cause even empty space to behave as a polarizable
medium. This is the routinely observed phenomenon of vacuum polarization. We
show that the quantum fluctuations of low mass, scalar fields are enormously
amplified during inflation. If one of these fields is charged, the vacuum
polarization effect of flat space is strengthened to the point that long wave
length photons acquire mass. Our result for this mass is shown to agree with a
simple model in which the massive photon electrodynamics of Proca emerges from
applying the Hartree approximation to scalar quantum electrodynamics during
inflation. A huge photon mass is not measured today because the original phase
of inflation ended when the universe was only a tiny fraction of a second old.
However, the zero-point energy left over from the epoch of large photon mass
may have persisted during the post-inflationary universe as very weak, but
cosmological-scale, magnetic fields. It has been suggested that these small
seed fields were amplified by a dynamo mechanism to produce the micro-Gauss
magnetic fields observed in galaxies and galactic clusters.

spectral magnetic power that is decreasing with increasing wavenumber,
regardless of whether or not the turbulence has helicity. This means that the
root-mean-square field strength converges to a limiting value at large magnetic
Reynolds numbers. The total (magnetic and kinetic) energy spectrum tends to be
somewhat shallower than k^{-5/3}, in agreement with the findings of other
groups. In the presence of helicity, an inverse cascade develops, provided the
scale separation between the size of the computational box and the scale of the

Also the (B-V), (V-I) two-color diagrams differ between Cepheids in the Galaxy

the spectral energy distributions of the Cepheids and to a shift in the

well-defined sample of relatively bright QSOs (B<15) at z<0.3. We present here
the clustering analysis of the full spectroscopically identified database (392
AGN). The clustering signal at 0.02<z<0.22 is detected at a 3-4 sigma level and
its amplitude is measured to be r_0=8.6\pm 2.0 h^{-1} Mpc (in a LambdaCDM
model). The comparison with other classes of objects shows that low-redshift
QSOs are clustered in a similar way to Radio Galaxies, EROs and early-type
galaxies in general, although with a marginally smaller amplitude. The
comparison with recent results from the 2QZ shows that the correlation function
of QSOs is constant in redshift or marginally increasing toward low redshift.
We discuss this behavior with physically motivated models, deriving interesting
constraints on the typical mass of the dark matter halos hosting QSOs, M_DMH=
10^{12.7} h^{-1} M_sun (10^{12.0}-10^{13.5}h^{-1} M_sun at 1 sigma confidence

local AGN, obtaining M_BH=2 10^8 h^{-1} M_sun (10^7-3 10^9 h^{-1} M_sun) for

events initiated by development of tearing mode in magnetically-dominated
relativistic plasma. We formulate equations of resistive force-free
electrodynamics, discuss its relation to ideal electrodynamics, and give
examples of both ideal and resistive equilibria. Resistive force-free current
layers are unstable toward the development of small-scale current sheets where
resistive effects become important. Thin current sheets are found to be
unstable due to the development of resistive force-free tearing mode. The
growth rate of tearing mode is intermediate between the short \Alfven time
scale $ \tau_A$ and a long resistive time scale $\tau_R$: $\Gamma \sim
1/(\tau_R \tau_A)^{1/2}$, similar to the case of non-relativistic
non-force-free plasma. We propose that growth of tearing mode is related to the

inferred to be black holes. The brightest source has a much harder spectrum
(Gamma = 0.9\pm0.1) than that found in Galactic black hole candidates and other

logarithm of the Sersic index `n' and the host galaxy magnitude is -0.77 at a
significance of 99.9%. We explain the observed relationship between dE galaxy
luminosity and inner logarithmic profile slope (gamma-prime) as a by-product of
the correlation between luminosity and Sersic index n. Including, from the
literature, an additional 232 dE and E galaxies spanning 10 mag in absolute
magnitude (M), the dE galaxies are shown to display a continuous sequence with
the brighter E galaxies such that mu_0 brightens linearly with M until core
formation causes the most luminous (M_B < -20.5 mag) E galaxies to deviate from
this relation. The different behavior of dE and E galaxies in the M-mu_e (and
M-<mu>_e) diagram, and the <mu>_e-log(R_e) diagram have nothing to do with core
formation, and are in fact expected from the continuous and linear relation
between M and mu_0 and M and log(n).

bimodal at all redshifts out to z~1. This bimodality permits a
model-independent definition of red, early-type galaxies and blue, late-type

towards the present day, and the number density of blue luminous galaxies has
dropped strongly since z~1. Focusing on the red galaxies, we find that they
populate a color-magnitude relation. Such red sequences have been identified in
galaxy cluster environments, but our data show that such a sequence exists over
this redshift range even when averaging over all environments. The mean color
of the red galaxy sequence evolves with redshift in a way that is consistent
with the aging of an ancient stellar population. The rest-frame B-band
luminosity density in red galaxies evolves only mildly with redshift in a
Lambda-dominated cold dark matter universe. Accounting for the change in
stellar mass-to-light ratio implied by the redshift evolution in red galaxy
colors, the COMBO-17 data indicate an increase in stellar mass on the red
sequence by a factor of two since z~1. The largest source of uncertainty is
large-scale structure, implying that considerably larger surveys are necessary
to further refine this result. We explore mechanisms that may drive this
evolution in the red galaxy population, finding that both galaxy merging and
truncation of star formation in some fraction of the blue, star-forming
population are required to fully explain the properties of these galaxies.

show that the heating rate induced by the Lyman alpha scatterings is much lower

is most likely the X-rays from the first ionizing sources, which are able to
penetrate into the atomic medium. The scattering of Lyman alpha photons couples
the hydrogen spin temperature to the kinetic temperature. If the first ionizing
sources in the universe did not emit significant X-rays, the spin temperature
would be rapidly brought down to the very low gas kinetic temperature, and a
21cm absorption signal against the CMB larger than 100 mK would be predicted.
However, we argue that sufficient X-rays are likely to have been emitted by the
first stellar population, implying that the gas kinetic temperature should
rapidly increase, turning a reduced and brief absorption signal into emission,
with a smaller amplitude of about 10 mK. The detection of the 21cm absorption

an important clue to the binary nature of SN Ia, perhaps associated with an

X-ray continuum dominated filaments located around the edge of the remnant
(that are identified with the forward shock) show expansion rates from 0.02%/yr

Their median value of 0.21%/yr is equal to the median expansion of the bright
ring (0.21%/yr) as measured with Einstein and ROSAT. This presents a conundrum
if the motion of the bright ring is indicative of the reverse shock speed. We
have also re-evaluated the motion of the radio bright ring with emphasis on
angle-averaged emissivity profiles. Our new measurement of the expansion of the
angle-averaged radio bright ring is 0.07 plus or minus 0.03%/yr, somewhat
slower than the previous radio measurements of 0.11%/yr which were sensitive to
the motions of small-scale features. We propose that the expansion of the
small-scale bright ring features in the optical, X-ray, and radio do not
represent the expansion of the reverse shock, but rather represent a
brightness-weighted average of ejecta passing through and being decelerated by
the reverse shock. The motion of the reverse shock, itself, is then represented
by the motion of the angle-averaged emissivity profile of the radio bright

modified, quasi-parallel shocks in 1D plane-parallel geometry with the physical
parameters relevant for the shocks emerging in the large scale structure
formation of the universe (Kang & Jones 2002). In order to consider the CR
acceleration at shocks with a broader range of physical properties, in this
contribution we present additional simulations. For a given Mach number, shocks
with higher speeds accelerate CRs faster with a greater number of particles.
However, two shocks with a same Mach number but with different shock speeds
evolve qualitatively similarly when the results are presented in terms of
diffusion length and time scales. Therefore, the time asymptotic value for the
fraction of shock kinetic energy transferred to CRs is mainly controlled by
shock Mach number rather than shock speed. We present the ``CR energy ratio''
for a wide range of shock parameters and for $\epsilon=0.2-0.3$ at terminal
time of our simulations. We suggest that these values can be considered as
time-asymptotic values for the CR acceleration efficiency, since the

cladistics. It makes use of characters that can exist in at least two states,
one being ancestral and the other one derived. Objects are gathered depending
on the derived states they share. We illustrate a first application of this
method to astrophysics, that we name astrocladistics, with dwarf galaxies from

tested up to P=128 processors on an IBM SP4 machine. In the large $P$ limit the
average CPU time per processor necessary for solving the gravitational

non-equilibrium coarsening dynamics after a quench to low $T$ (Phys. Rev.\
Lett. 83:3238, 1999), including the anomalous coarsening of down-spin domains
with typical size $\bar{d} \sim t^{T \ln 2}$, and the pronounced `fragile
glass'-divergence of equilibration times as $t_*=\exp(1/T^2\ln 2)$. We also
link the model to the paste-all coarsening model, defining a family of
interpolating models that all have the same scaling distribution of domain
sizes. We then proceed to the problem of equilibrium dynamics at low $T$. Based
on a scaling hypothesis for the relation between timescales and lengthscales,
we propose a model for the dynamics of `superdomains' which are bounded by
up-spins that are frozen on long timescales. From this we deduce that the
equilibrium spin correlation and persistence functions should exhibit identical
scaling behaviour for low $T$, decaying as $g(\tilde{t})$. The scaling variable
is $\tilde{t}=(t/t_*)^{T\ln 2}$, giving strongly stretched behaviour for low
$T$. The scaling function $g(\cdot)$ decays faster than exponential, however,
and in the limit $T\to 0$ at fixed $\tilde{t}$ reaches zero at a {\em finite}
value of $\tilde{t}$.

Analytical formulas for the optimal input and output frequency dependencies are

frequency-dependent squeezing angle into the dark port yields an improvement on
the noise spectral density by a factor of exp(-2r) (in power) over the entire
squeezing bandwidth, where r is the squeezing parameter. It is further shown
that frequency-dependent (variational) homodyne read-out leads to an additional
increase in sensitivity which is significant in the wings of the doubly

ordinary output homodyne detection is shown to be realizable by applying two
optical filters on a frequency-independent squeezed vacuum. Throughout this

precluded the study of differential cross sections in elastic scattering. Here
it is shown that the regime extends down to order N_c^{1/2} which includes the
higher end of the elastic regime. The prediction is that in the large N_c
limit, observables describable via mean-field theory are unchanged when the
spin and isospin of either nucleon are both flipped. This prediction is tested
for proton-proton and neutron-proton elastic scattering data and found to fail
badly. We argue that this failure can be traced to a lack of a clear separation
of scales between momentum of order N_c^{1/2} and N_c^1 when N_c is as small as
three. The situation is compounded by an anomalously low particle production
threshold due to approximate chiral symmetry.

solvability of principal type pseudo-differential operators is equivalent to
condition ($\Psi$). This condition rules out certain sign changes of the
imaginary part of the principal symbol along the bicharacteristics of the real
part. We obtain local solvability by proving a localizable estimate of the
adjoint operator with a loss of two derivatives (compared with the elliptic
case).
  The proof involves a new metric in the Weyl (or Beals-Fefferman) calculus
which makes it possible to reduce to the case when the gradient of the
imaginary part is non-vanishing, so that the zeroes forms a smooth submanifold.
The estimate uses a new type of weight, which measures the changes of the
distance to the zeroes of the imaginary part along the bicharacteristics of the
real part between the minima of the curvature of this submanifold. By using
condition ($\Psi$) and this weight, we can construct a multiplier giving the
estimate.

paper a two-parameter class of Askey-Wilson polynomials was expanded as a
finite Fourier series with a product of two 3phi2's as Fourier coefficients.
The proof given there used the quantum group interpretation. Here this identity
will be generalized to a 3-parameter class of Askey-Wilson polynomials being
expanded in terms of continuous q-ultraspherical polynomials with a product of
two 2phi2's as coefficients, and an analytic proof will be given for it. Then
Gegenbauer's addition formula for ultraspherical polynomials and Rahman's
addition formula for q-Bessel functions will be obtained as limit cases. This
q-analogue of Gegenbauer's addition formula is quite different from the
addition formula for continuous q-ultraspherical polynomials obtained by Rahman
and Verma in 1986. Furthermore, the functions occurring as factors in the
expansion coefficents will be interpreted as a special case of a system of
biorthogonal rational functions with respect to the Askey-Roy q-beta measure. A
degenerate case of this biorthogonality are Pastro's biorthogonal polynomials

pendulum or swinging spring are in the ratio two-to-one, there is a regular
exchange of energy between the two modes of oscillation. We refer to this
phenomenon as pulsation. Between the horizontal excursions, or pulses, the
spring undergoes a change of azimuth which we call the precession angle. The
pulsation and stepwise precession are the characteristic features of the
dynamics of the swinging spring.
  The modulation equations for the small-amplitude resonant motion of the
system are the well-known three-wave equations. We use Hamiltonian reduction to
determine a complete analytical solution. The amplitudes and phases are
expressed in terms of both Weierstrass and Jacobi elliptic functions. The
strength of the pulsation may be computed from the invariants of the equations.
Several analytical formulas are found for the precession angle.
  We deduce simplified approximate expressions, in terms of elementary
functions, for the pulsation amplitude and precession angle and demonstrate
their high accuracy by numerical experiments. Thus, for given initial
conditions, we can describe the envelope dynamics without solving the
equations. Conversely, given the parameters which determine the envelope, we
can specify initial conditions which, to a high level of accuracy, yield this
envelope.

followed by the application of superoperator that orders involved operators.
The operator version of Poisson bracket is defined being the Lie bracket which
substitutes commutator in the von Neumann equation. These result in obstruction
free quantization, with the ordering rule which coincides with Weyl ordering
rule.

polarization self-rotation in rubidium vapor following a proposal by Matsko et
al. [Phys. Rev. A 66, 043815 (2002)]. The experimental setup, involving in
essence just a diode laser and a heated rubidium gas cell, is simple and easily
scalable. A squeezing of 0.85+-0.05 dB was achieved.

presence of a single point defect at the wire's cut-off frequencies. We show
that while the conductance pattern (i.e., the scattering) is strongly affected
by the presence of the defect, the pattern is totally independent of the
defect's characteristics (i.e., the defect that caused the scattering cannot be
identified from that pattern).

multiparties. It is shown how N parties can teleport N unknown quantum states
to M other parties with the use of N+M qudits in the maximally entangled state.
It is also shown that a single pair of qudits in the maximally entangled state
can be used to teleport two qudits in opposite directions simultaneously.

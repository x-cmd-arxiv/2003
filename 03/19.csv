spectrum is marked by a sharp drop in flux at 0.7 keV which has been
interpreted by Branduardi-Raymont et al. as the blue wing of a relativistic
OVIII emission line and by Lee at al. as a dusty warm absorber. We find that
the drop is well explained by the FeI L2,3 absorption edges and obtain
reasonable fits over the 0.32-1.7 keV band using a multizone, dusty warm
absorber model. Some residuals remain which could be due to emission from a
relativistic disc, but at a much weaker level than from any model relying on
relativistic emission lines alone. A model based on such emission lines can be
made to fit if sufficient (warm) absorption is added, although the line
strengths exceed those expected. The EPIC pn difference spectrum between the
highest and lowest flux states of the source indicates that this is a power-law
in the 3-10 keV band which, if extrapolated to lower energies, reveals the
absorption function acting on the intrinsic spectrum, provided that any
emission lines do not scale exactly with the continuum. We find that this
function matches our dusty warm absorber model well. The soft X-ray spectrum is
therefore dominated by absorption structures, with the equivalent width of any

the 7mm emission in approximately the north-south direction, confirming
previous results obtained with lower resolution. We use a two-layer flared disk
model to interpret the observed fluxes from 7mm to 1.3mm together with the
resolved 7mm structure. We find that the disk radius is constrained to the
range 100 to 300 AU, depending on the steepness of the disk surface density
distribution. The power law index of the dust opacity coefficient, beta, is
constrained to be 0.5 to 0.7. Since the models indicate that the disk is
optically thin at millimeter wavelengths for radii greater than 8 AU, the
contribution of an optically thick region to the emission is less than 10%.
This implies that high optical depth or complex disk geometry cannot be the
cause of the observed shallow millimeter spectral index. Instead, the new
analysis supports the earlier suggestion that dust particles in the disk have
grown to sizes as large as a few centimeters. The dust in the CQ Tauri system
appears to be evolved much like that in the TW Hydra system, a well-studied
pre-main-sequence star of similar age and lower mass. The survival of gas-rich
disks with incomplete grain evolution at such old ages deserves further
investigations.

identify the physical limitations of the UV Gaussian modeling as the probable

modeling cannot account for a velocity dependent covering fraction, and it is a
poor representation for absorption associated with a dynamical outflow.
Analysis techniques that use a single covering fraction value for each

ways to improve the UV analysis.

hole is much less massive than those thought to exist in classical active
galactic nuclei, its accretion rate of L_bol/L_Edd ~ 2x10^-2 to 2x10^-3 is

dependence of the spontaneous magnetization, and of generalizations thereof, is
considered. It is argued that in the derivation one should not only consider
the exchange interaction between the spins, but also the other interactions
between them, leading to elliptical spin precession and deviations from the
parabolic dispersion of magnons. Also interaction effects are important to
explain the apparent universality of generalized Bloch law exponents e_B,
defined by M_s(T)= M_s(0)-const. x T^{e_B}, valid in a wide temperature range
T_1 < T < T_2, and for dimensionalities d = 1, 2, and 3. The above-mentioned
temperature range, the 'Bloch range', lies above the quantum range, where
magnetic long-range order (e.g. in d=2 dimensions) is nontrivially enforced by
the additional interactions, but below the thermal critical region, where
universal 'anomalous scaling dimensions' apply. In contrast, for the Bloch
temperature region, the universality is only apparent, i.e. a
crossover-phenomenon, and simple scaling considerations with 'normal
dimensions' apply.
  However, due to interactions, the Bloch exponent e_B depends not only on the
dimensionality d of the system, but also on the spin quantum number s (mod
(1/2)) of the system, i.e. for given d the Bloch exponent e_B is different for
half-integer s and for integer s.

is a classical Ginzburg-Landau field theory restricted to a bounded
one-dimensional spatial domain, perturbed by weak spatiotemporal noise having a
flat power spectrum in time and space. Our analysis extends the Kramers theory
of noise-induced transitions to the case when the system acted on by the noise
has nonzero spatial extent, and the noise itself is spatially dependent. By
extending the Langer-Coleman theory of the noise-induced decay of a metastable
state, we determine the dependence of the activation barrier and the Kramers
reversal rate prefactor on the size of the spatial domain. As this is increased
from zero and passes through a certain critical value, a transition between
activation regimes occurs, at which the rate prefactor diverges. Beyond the
transition, reversal preferentially takes place in a spatially inhomogeneous
rather than in a homogeneous way. Transitions of this sort were not discovered
by Langer or Coleman, since they treated only the infinite-volume limit. Our
analysis uses higher transcendental functions to handle the case of finite
volume. Similar transitions between activation regimes should occur in other
models of metastable systems with nonzero spatial extent, perturbed by weak
noise, as the size of the spatial domain is varied.

density functional theory (DFT) calculations where the Sm f-bands, which are
difficult to include in DFT calculations, have been treated within the LDA+U
formalism. The large MAE comes mostly from the Sm f-shell anisotropy, stemming
from an interplay between the crystal field and the spin-orbit coupling. We
found that both are of similar strengths, unlike some other Sm compounds,
leading to a partial quenching of the orbital moment (f-states cannot be
described as either pure lattice harmonics or pure complex harmonics), an
optimal situation for enhanced MAE. A smaller portion of the MAE can be
associated with the Co-d band anisotropy, related to the peak in the density of
states at the Fermi energy. Our result for the MAE of SmCo5, 21.6 meV/f.u.,

additional constraints on the parameter space of the theory, even when the

agree with the necessary conditions for the tachyon field to be a primary

which the metric coefficients are already time independent, then they will
remain time independent during the subsequent evolution, {\em i.e.} the lapse
will not evolve and will therefore not drive the time lines away from the
Killing direction. Second, the modified condition is naturally adapted to the
use of a densitized lapse as a fundamental variable, which in turn makes it a
good candidate for a dynamic slicing condition that can be used in conjunction

inflationary paradigm, a period of exponential expansion in the early universe
responsible for the large-scale homogeneity and spatial flatness of our

the microwave background as temperature anisotropies, were produced during
inflation from quantum fluctuations that were stretched to cosmological size by
the expansion, and later gave rise, via gravitational collapse, to the observed
large-scale structure of clusters and superclusters of galaxies. Furthermore,
the same theory predicts that all the matter and radiation in the universe
today originated at the end of inflation from an explosive production of

naturally and simultaneously solves the strong CP and mu problems via a
Peccei-Quinn and a continuous R symmetry is considered. This model is
supplemented with hybrid inflation and leptogenesis, but without taking the
specific details of these scenarios. It is shown that the Peccei-Quinn field
can successfully act as a curvaton generating the total curvature perturbation
in the universe in accord with the cosmic background explorer measurements. A
crucial phenomenon, which assists us to achieve this, is the ""tachyonic
amplification"" of the perturbation acquired by this field during inflation if
the field, in its subsequent evolution, happens to be stabilized for a while
near a maximum of the potential. In this case, the contribution of the field to
the total energy density is also enhanced (""tachyonic effect""), which helps
too. The cold dark matter in the universe consists, in this model, mainly of
axions which carry an isocurvature perturbation uncorrelated with the total
curvature perturbation. There are also lightest sparticles (neutralinos) which,
like the baryons, originate from the inflationary reheating and, thus, acquire
an isocurvature perturbation fully correlated with the curvature perturbation.
So, the overall isocurvature perturbation has a mixed correlation with the
adiabatic one. It is shown that the presently available bound on such an
isocurvature perturbation from cosmic microwave background radiation and other
data is satisfied. Also, the constraint on the non-Gaussianity of the curvature
perturbation obtained from the recent Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data
is fulfilled thanks to the ""tachyonic effect"".

to the case of charged scalars coupled to Abelian gauge fields that has been

demonstrate that the most promising decays for measuring TP's in the SM involve
excited final-state vector mesons, and we provide estimates of such TP's. We
find that there are only a handful of decays in which large TP's are possible,

of the anharmonic oscillator in zero spacetime dimensions. In one spacetime
dimension we derive the imaginary part of the ground state energy of the
anharmonic oscillator for {\em all negative values of the coupling constant
$g$, including the nonanalytic tunneling regime at small-$g$. As a highlight of
the theory we retrieve from the divergent perturbation expansion the action of
the critical bubble and the contribution of the higher loop fluctuations around
the bubble.

left incomplete due to the lack of a Hamiltonian description. The form of our
Hamiltonian is such that the action of a Lorentz transformation is explicitly
described by a canonical transformation (with rescaling of the evolution
parameter). The method is closed and defines the Hamiltonian in implicit form
without power expansions. We outline the method with an emphasis on the physics
of this complex conservative dynamical system. The Hamiltonian orbits are
calculated numerically at low energies using a self-consistent steepest-descent
method (a stable numerical method that chooses only the nonrunaway solution).
The two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian suggests a simple prescription for the
canonical quantization of the relativistic two-body problem.

for actions of countable groups on topological and smooth manifolds. For
example, for any action of a countable group $\Gamma$ on a topological manifold
where the fixed sets for any element are contained in codimension two
submanifolds, every orbit equivalence is equivariant. Even in the presence of
larger fixed sets, for actions preserving rigid geometric structures our
results force sufficiently smooth orbit equivalences to be equivariant. For
instance, if a countable group $\Gamma$ acts on ${\mathbb T}^n$ and the action
is $C^1$ orbit equivalent to the standard action of $SL_n({\mathbb Z})$ on
${\mathbb T}^n$, then $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $SL_n({\mathbb Z})$ and the
actions are isomorphic. (The same result holds if we replace $SL_n(\mathbb Z)$
by a finite index subgroup.) We also show that preserving a geometric structure
is an invariant of smooth orbit equivalence and give an application of our
ideas to the theory of hyperbolic groups.
  In the course of proving our theorems, we generalize a theorem of Sierpinski
which says that a connected Hausdorff compact topological space is not the
disjoint union of countably many closed sets. We prove a stronger statement
that allows ""small"" intersections provided the space is locally connected. This
implies that for any continuous action of a countable group $\G$ on a
connected, locally connected, locally compact, Hausdorff topological space,

that are indirectly triggered and is given by the average number of triggered

N-dimensional quantum system that requires only an $N^2$-dimensional quantum
environment and random classical fields. This model offers the advantage that
it may be implemented on small quantum information processors in order to
explore the intermediate regime between semiclassical and fully quantum models.
We consider in particular $\sigma_z\sigma_z$ system-environment couplings which
induce coherence (phase) damping, though the model is directly extendable to
other coupling Hamiltonians. Effective, irreversible phase-damping of the
system is obtained by applying an additional stochastic Hamiltonian on the
environment alone, periodically redressing it and thereby irreversibliy
randomizing the system phase information that has leaked into the environment
as a result of the coupling. This model is exactly solvable in the case of
phase-damping, and we use this solution to describe the model's behavior in
some limiting cases. In the limit of small stochastic phase kicks the system's
coherence decays exponentially at a rate which increases linearly with the kick
frequency. In the case of strong kicks we observe an effective decoupling of
the system from the environment. We present a detailed implementation of the
method on an nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processor.

`absolute phase' is achievable, even if it has not been achieved yet. I will
argue to the contrary that `true coherence' or `absolute phase' is always
illusory, as the concept of absolute time on a scale beyond direct human
experience is meaningless. All we can ever do is to use an agreed time
standard. In this context, a laser beam is fundamentally as good a `clock' as
any other. I explain in detail why this claim is true, and defend my argument
against various objections. In the process I discuss super-selection rules,
quantum channels, and the ultimate limits to the performance of a laser as a
clock. For this last topic I use some earlier work by myself [Phys. Rev. A {\bf

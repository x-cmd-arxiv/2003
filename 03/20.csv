stars within 0.4 pc from Sgr A* -- the presumed location of a supermassive

should be suppressed by the black hole's tidal field. We find that out of 13
stars whose 3-dimensional velocities have been measured by Genzel et. al.

with zero within the measurement errors, and does not exceed 10 degrees. We
propose that a recent burst of star formation has occurred in a dense gaseous
disk around Sgr A*. Such a disk is no longer present because, most likely, it
has been accreted by the central black hole. The three-dimensional orbit of S2,
the young star closest to Sgr A*, has been recently mapped out with high
precision. It is inclined to the stellar disk by 75 degrees. We find that the
orbit should undergo Lense-Thirring precession with the period of (5/a) Myr,
where a<1 is the dimensionless spin of the black hole. Therefore it is possible
that originally S2 orbit lay in the disk plane. If so, we can constrain the
black hole spin $a$ be greater than 0.2(t_{S2}/5 Myr), where t_{S2} is the age

young, luminous O and B stars. Three objects have pronounced He II 1640

with WFPC and WFPC2 visual photometry, we derive the extinction curve for NGC
604. We use this curve, the distance for M33, derived UV spectral types, and
HST photometry, to determine positions of these stars in the upper H-R diagram.
The revised O star effective temperature scale (Martins et al.) is essential in
obtaining reliable positions in the log(L*)-log(T(eff)) plane. These stars are
quite young with an age of ~3 Myr. The spectra and photometry indicate three
exceedingly luminous objects. Their inferred locations in the H-R diagram
indicate stellar masses > 120 solar masses. High spatial resolution HST imagery
provides no evidence of multiple stars composing these objects. Still we cannot
eliminate the possibility that they are unresolved multiple stars of lower
mass, possibly W-R stars. Tests demonstrate that the ten most luminous stars
predominantly determine the UV spectral features seen in the total light of NGC

recognized regimes of hydrogen and helium bursts, and in addition shows that at
high accretion rates, near the limit of stable burning, there is a regime of
``delayed mixed bursts'' which is distinct from the more usual ``prompt mixed
bursts.'' In delayed mixed bursts, a large fraction of the fuel is burned
stably before the burst is triggered. Bursts thus have longer recurrence times,
but at the same time have somewhat smaller fluences. Therefore, the parameter
alpha, which measures the ratio of the energy released via accretion to that
generated through nuclear reactions in the burst, is up to an order of
magnitude larger than for prompt bursts. This increase in alpha near the
threshold of stable burning has been seen in observations. We explore a wide
range of mass accretion rates, neutron star radii and core temperatures, and
calculate a variety of burst properties. From a preliminary comparison with
data, we suggest that bursting neutron stars may have hot cores, with T_{core}
>~ 10^{7.5} K, consistent with interior cooling via the modified URCA or
similar low-efficiency process, rather than T_{core} ~ 10^7 K, as expected for
the direct URCA process. There is also an indication that neutron star radii

derived from the most widely used strong-line ""empirical"" abundance indicators.
We suspect that most of the disagreement with the strong-line abundances arises
from uncertainties in the nebular models that are used to calibrate the
""empirical"" scale, and that strong-line abundances derived for HII regions and
emission-line galaxies are as much as a factor of two higher than the actual
oxygen abundances. However other explanations, such as the effects of
temperature fluctuations on the auroral line based abundances cannot be
completely ruled out. These results point to the need for direct abundance
determinations of a larger sample of extragalactic HII regions, especially for
objects more metal-rich than solar.

  Other Obervatories"", Marsala (Sicily, Italy), 23 - 25 September 2002",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss the effect of nonlinear bulk viscosity and the associated
reheating on the evolution of newly born, rapidly rotating neutron stars with
r-modes destabilized through the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) mechanism.
Bulk viscosity in these stars is due to the adjustment of the relative
abundances of different particle species as the density of a fluid element is
perturbed. It becomes nonlinear when the chemical potential difference
$\delta\mu$, measuring the chemical imbalance in the fluid element, becomes
larger than the temperature $T$, which is generally much smaller than the Fermi
energy. From this scale on, the bulk viscosity increases much faster with
$\delta\mu$ than predicted by the usual, linear approximation. This provides a
potential saturation mechanism for stellar oscillation modes at a small to
moderate amplitude. In addition, bulk viscosity dissipates energy, which can
lead to neutrino emission, reheating of the star, or both. This is the first
study to explicitly consider these effects in the evolution of the r-mode
instability. For stars with little or no hyperon bulk viscosity, these effects
are not strong enough to prevent the r-modes from growing to amplitudes
$\alpha\sim 1$ or higher, so other saturation mechanisms will probably set in
earlier. The reheating effect makes spin-down occur at a higher temperature
than would otherwise be the case, in this way possibly avoiding complications
associated with a solid crust or a core superfluid. On the other hand, stars
with a substantial hyperon bulk viscosity and a moderate magnetic field
saturate their mode amplitude at a low value, which makes them gravitational
radiators for hundreds of years, while they lose angular momentum through
gravitational waves and magnetic braking.

dark matter (SFDM) hypothesis predicts the same structure formation as the cold
dark matter one. This means that CDM and SFDM are equivalent from the
cosmological point of view. The free parameters of the SFDM model can be fixed
using cosmological observations. In a previous work, we showed by solving the
Einstein Klein Gordon equations, that if we use such parameters, the scalar
field collapses forming stable objects with a mass around $10^{12}M_{\odot}$.
In the present work we use analytical solutions of the flat and weak field
limit of the Einstein- Klein-Gordon equations. With this solutions we show that
its scalar field density profile corresponds to a halo with an almost flat
central density and that this halo coincides with the CDM model in a large
outer region. Such a result could solve the problem of the cusp DM halo in
galaxies without extra hypothesis, adding to the viability of the SFDM model.
Thus, the SFDM model can be seen as an alternative model to the CDM one, with a
self interacting WIMP.

equilibrium (ICE) for calculating the CO number density in the solar atmosphere
is of crucial importance for the resolution of the long-standing controversy
over the existence of `cool clouds' in the chromosphere, and for determining
whether the cool gas owes its existence to CO radiative cooling or to a
hydrodynamical process. Here we report the first results of such an
investigation in which we have carried out time-dependent gas-phase chemistry
calculations in radiation hydrodynamical simulations of solar chromospheric
dynamics. We show that while the ICE approximation turns out to be suitable for
modeling the observed infrared CO lines at the solar disk center, it may
substantially overestimate the `heights of formation' of strong CO lines
synthesized close to the edge of the solar disk, especially concerning vigorous
dynamic cases resulting from relatively strong photospheric disturbances. This
happens because during the cool phases of the hydrodynamical simulations the CO
number density in the outer atmospheric regions is smaller than what is
stipulated by the ICE approximation, resulting in decreased CO opacity in the
solar chromosphere. As a result, the cool CO-bearing gas which produces the
observed molecular lines must be located at atmospheric heights not greater
than 700 km, approximately. We conclude that taking into account the
non-equilibrium chemistry improves the agreement with the available on-disk and
off-limb observations, but that the hydrodynamical simulation model has to be
even cooler than anticipated by the ICE approximation, and this has to be the
case at the `new' (i.e. deeper) formation regions of the rovibrational CO
lines.

pseudogap in high temperature superconductors. The pseudogap appears as a
depression of the frequency dependent conductivity in the c-axis direction and
seems to be related to a real gap in the density of states. It can also be seen
in the Knight shift, photoemission and tunneling experiments. In underdoped
samples it appears near room temperature and does not close with temperature.
Another related phenomenon that has been studied by infrared is the depression
in the ab-plane scattering rate. Two separate effects can be discerned. At high
temperatures there is broad depression of scattering below 1000 cm-1 which may
be related to the gap in the density of states. At a lower temperature a
sharper structure is seen, which appears to be associated with scattering from
a mode at 300 cm-1, and which governs the carrier life time at low
temperatures. This mode shows up in a number of other experiments, as a kink in
ARPES dispersion, and a resonance at 41 meV in magnetic neutron scattering.
Since the infrared technique can be used on a wide range of samples it has
provided evidence that the scattering mode is present in all high temperature
cuprates and that its frequency in optimally doped materials scales with the
superconducting transition temperature. The lanthanum and neodymium based
cuprates do not follow this scaling and appear to have depressed transition
temperatures.

operation. However, in physical implementations, various couplings with the
environment are unavoidable and can lead to a dephasing of a quantum
bit(qubit). The background charge fluctuations are an important dephasing
process, especially in a charge qubit system. We examined the dephasing rate of
a qubit due to random telegraph noise. Solving stochastic differential
equations, we obtained the dephasing rate of a qubit constructed of a
coupled-dot system; we applied our results to the charge Josephson qubit
system. We examined the dephasing rates due to two types of couplings between
the coupled-dot system and the background charge, namely, fluctuation in the
tunnel coupling constant and fluctuation in the asymmetric bias. For a strong
coupling condition, the dephasing rate was inversely proportional to the time
constant of the telegraph noise. When there is fluctuation in the tunnel
coupling constant, Gaussian decay occurs in the initial regime. We also
examined the rate of dephasing due to many impurity sites. For a weak coupling
condition with fluctuation in the asymmetric bias, the obtained dephasing rate
coincided with that obtained by the perturbation method using the spectral
weight of a boson thermal bath, which is proportional to the inverse of the
frequency.

to a slowly varying magnetic field or to a varying current intensity.
Experiments were performed on a YBCO specimen suitably treated in order to
weaken the weak links without affecting the oxygen content of grains. The
weakening of the intergrain region allowed the use of very small magnetic
fields and currents to induce the resistive transition of the specimen and to
observe current noise. The induced noise is of the 1/f^2 type and will be
interpreted in terms of two different models. One of the model is based on the
enhancement of the noise due to the clustering of the resistive transition of
the weak links, produced by correlation effects related to the strong
nonlinearity of their Josephson type I-V characteristics. This model has been
the object of a computer simulation based on a 3D-network of Josephson-like
elements and seems suitable to explain the noise produced by current variation.
The second model explains the excess noise as produced by discontinuous
penetration of the magnetic flux inside the intergrain region. This
discontinuity is related to the field screening effect of rings made of several
superconducting weak links connecting different grains, which are alternatively
broken and restored by the current induced during flux variation, and seems
suitable to explain the larger noise produced by a varying magnetic field.

expensive to represent the full joint distribution over target states. In cases
where the targets move independently, each target can instead be tracked with a
separate filter. However, this leads to a model-data association problem.
Another approach to solve the problem with computational complexity is to track
only the first moment of the joint distribution, the probability hypothesis
density (PHD). The integral of this distribution over any area S is the
expected number of targets within S. Since no record of object identity is
kept, the model-data association problem is avoided.
  The contribution of this paper is a particle filter implementation of the PHD
filter mentioned above. This PHD particle filter is applied to tracking of
multiple vehicles in terrain, a non-linear tracking problem. Experiments show
that the filter can track a changing number of vehicles robustly, achieving

Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) could act as a curvaton and generate the
observed adiabatic density perturbations. For that the flat direction energy
density has to dominate the Universe at the time when it decays. We point out
that this is not possible if the inflaton decays into MSSM degrees of freedom.
If the inflaton is completely in the hidden sector, its decay products do not
couple to the flat direction, and the flat direction curvaton can dominate the
energy density. This requires the absence of a Hubble-induced mass for the
curvaton, e.g. by virtue of the Heisenberg symmetry. In the case of hidden
radiation, $n=9$ is the only admissible direction; for other hidden equations
of state, directions with lower $n$ may also dominate. We show that the MSSM
curvaton is further constrained severely by the damping of the fluctuations,
and as an example, demonstrate that in no-scale supergravity it would fragment
into $Q$ balls rather than decay. Damping of fluctuations can be avoided by an
initial condition, which for the $n=9$ direction would require an initial
curvaton amplitude of $\sim 10^{-2}M_p$, thereby providing a working example of
the MSSM flat direction curvaton.

symmetry we associate a non zero chemical potential. The Bose-Einstein
condensation of the Higgs leads, at tree level, to modified dispersion
relations for the Higgs field while the dispersion relations of the gauge
bosons and fermions remain undisturbed. The latter are modified through higher
order corrections. We have computed some corrections to the vacuum
polarizations of the gauge bosons and fermions. To quantify the corrections to

new generalized Verma modules. They are called k-Verma modules, k\in N, and
coincide with the usual Verma modules for k=1. As a vector space a k-Verma
module is isomorphic to the symmetric tensor product of k copies of the
universal enveloping algebra U(g^-), where g^- is the subalgebra of lowering
generators in the standard triangular decomposition of a simple Lie algebra g =
g^+ \oplus h \oplus g^- . The second development is the proposal of a procedure
for the construction of multilinear intertwining differential operators for
semisimple Lie groups G . This procedure uses k-Verma modules and coincides for
k=1 with a procedure for the construction of linear intertwining differential
operators. For all k central role is played by the singular vectors of the
k-Verma modules. Explicit formulae for series of such singular vectors are
given. Using these are given explicitly many new examples of multilinear
intertwining differential operators. In particular, for G = SL(2,R) are given
explicitly all bilinear intertwining differential operators. Using the latter,
as an application are constructed (n/2)-differentials for all n\in 2N, the
ordinary Schwarzian being the case n=4. As another application, in a Note Added

divergences in the longitudinal momentum $p_-$ are removed by gauge invariant
finite mode regularization. We find that LF canonical formalism for the
introduced regularization does not contain usual most complicated second class

scheme can be used either for the regularization of conventional gauge theory

direction \cite{mpp1}. The geometric Lorenz attractor \cite{gw} is an example
of a singular hyperbolic attractor. In this paper we study the perturbations of
singular hyperbolic attractors for three-dimensional flows. It is proved that
any attractor obtained from such perturbations contains a singularity. So,
there is an upper bound for the number of attractors obtained from such
perturbations. Furthermore, every three-dimensional flow $C^r$ close to one
exhibiting a singular hyperbolic attractor has a singularity non isolated in
the non wandering set. We also give sufficient conditions for a singularity of
a three-dimensional flow to be stably non isolated in the nonwandering set.
These results generalize well known properties of the Lorenz attractor.

practical implementation of quantum key distribution protocols with entangled
states.

  Computation Scheme","13 pages, 5 figures, bachelor degree thesis",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  We show that a superconducting circuit containing two loops, when treated
with Macroscopic Quantum Coherence (MQC) theory, constitutes a complete two-bit
quantum computer. The manipulation of the system is easily implemented with
alternating magnetic fields. A \textit{universal} set of quantum gates is
deemed available by means of all unitary single bit operations and a
controlled-not (\textsc{cnot}) sequence. We use multi-dimensional MQC theory
and time-dependent first order perturbation theory to analyze the model. Our
calculations show that a two qubit arrangement, each having a diameter of
200nm, operating in the flux regime can be operated with a static magnetic
field of $\sim 0.1$T, and an alternating dynamic magnetic field of amplitude
$\sim 1$ Gauss and frequency $\sim 10$Hz. The operational time $\tau_{op}$ is
estimated to be $\sim 10$ns.

  C. Ho (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In the past decade, much effort was devoted to measure the masses of
supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei, to establish the relation between
black hole mass and the global/nuclear properties of the host galaxy, and to
understand the role of these objects in the formation and subsequent dynamical
evolution of galaxies. This whole area of research is an appropriate and timely
topic for the first in this series of symposia. Nearly half the contributions
were devoted to the various methods that are being used to estimate masses of
central black holes, from nearby globular clusters all the way to quasars at
redshifts z>6. This work forms the foundation of our understanding of black
hole demography, and provides constraints on scenarios for black hole formation
and growth, and on their connection to the formation and properties of the host
galaxy. I will address these topics in this same order.

some fraction of burst afterglows are ``optically dark'' because their optical
afterglows at times > 1 hr after the burst are very faint, and thus have often
escaped detection. GRB 021211 shows that such ``optically dim'' bursts can have
very bright afterglows at times < 20 min after the burst.

plane which were previously invisible to earlier low-frequency and

far, including many that are young and exotic. In this paper we report the
discovery of 200 pulsars for which we present positional and spin-down

number of these new pulsars are young and energetic, and we review possible
associations of $\gamma$-ray sources with the sample of about 1300 pulsars for
which timing solutions are known. Based on a statistical analysis, we estimate
that about $19\pm6$ associations are genuine. The survey has also discovered 12
pulsars with spin properties similar to those of the Vela pulsar, nearly
doubling the known population of such neutron stars. Studying the properties of
all known `Vela-like' pulsars, we find their radio luminosities to be similar
to normal pulsars, implying that they are very inefficient radio sources.
Finally, we review the use of the newly discovered pulsars as Galactic probes

inflation at a scale $\Lambda_1$ as well as a second stage of inflation at

  We use a symmetric potential, valid in a frictionless world, in which the two
inflationary periods have exactly the same scale, i.e. $\Lambda_1=\Lambda_2$.
However, we see today $\Lambda_1 \gg \Lambda_2$ due to the friction terms
(expansion of the universe and interaction with matter). These type of models
can be motivated from supergravity.
  Inflation occurs close to the maxima of the potential. As a consequence both
inflations are necessarily finite. This opens the interesting possibility that
the second inflation has already or is about to end. A first inflation is
produced when fluctuations displace the inflaton field from its higher maximum
rolling down the potential as in new inflation. Instead of rolling towards a
global minimum the inflaton approaches a lower maximum where a second inflation
takes place.

are very black and show no evidence for any emission over a redshift interval
of ~0.2 starting at z=6. On the other hand, SDSS J1148+5251 shows a number of
emission peaks in the Ly beta Gunn-Peterson trough along with a single weak
peak in the Ly alpha trough. The Ly alpha emission has corresponding Ly beta
emission, suggesting that it is indeed a region of lower optical depth in the
intergalactic medium at z=6.08.
  The stronger Ly beta peaks in the spectrum of SDSS J1148+5251 could
conceivably also be the result of ""leaks"" in the IGM, but we suggest that they
are instead Ly alpha emission from an intervening galaxy at z=4.9. This
hypothesis gains credence from a strong complex of C IV absorption at the same
redshift and from the detection of continuum emission in the Ly alpha trough at
the expected brightness. If this proposal is correct, the quasar light has
probably been magnified through gravitational lensing by the intervening
galaxy. The Stromgren sphere observed in the absorption spectrum of SDSS
J1148+5251 is significantly smaller than expected based on its brightness,
which is consistent with the hypothesis that the quasar is lensed.
  If our argument for lensing is correct, the optical depths derived from the
troughs of SDSS J1148+5251 are only lower limits (albeit still quite strong,
with tau(LyA)>16 inferred from the Ly beta trough.) The Ly beta absorption

analyzing the stellar populations of the ""red envelope"" systems observed at

ages and abundances of old populations. A mid-UV to optical/IR wavelength
baseline provides good separation of population components because the main
sequence turnoff dominates the integrated light between 2500 and 4000 A. We
find a six magnitude difference in the mid-UV continuum level over the
metallicity range -1.5 < log Z/Z_o < +0.5 and a comparable difference (per unit
log t) for ages in the range 4-16 Gyr. Logarithmic derivatives of mid-UV colors
with respect to age or metal abundance are 3-10 times larger than for the UBV
region. Most of the spectral information on old populations therefore resides
below 4000 A. We investigate the capability of UBV and mid-UV broad-band colors
to separately determine age and abundance, taking into account precision in the
color measurements. We find that the mid-UV improves resolution in (log t,log
Z) space by about a factor of 3 for a given observational precision.
Contamination by hot horizontal branch phases can seriously affect mid-UV
spectra, reaching over 80% in some cases. However, this is straightforward to
remove as long as far-UV measurements are available. Finally, we show that a 4
Gyr, solar abundance model based on empirical spectra provides an excellent fit
to the mid-UV spectrum of the E galaxy M32. This indicates that the poorer
results obtained from theoretical spectra arise from limitations of the
synthesis models for individual stars. [Condensed]

effect of including more realistic geometries on the resulting spectral energy
distributions and images. We begin with a rotationally flattened infalling
envelope as our comparison model, and add a flared disk and bipolar cavity. The
disk affects the spectral energy distribution most strongly at edge-on
inclinations, causing a broad dip at about 10 um (independent of the silicate
feature) due to high extinction and low scattering albedo in this wavelength
region. The bipolar cavities allow more direct stellar+disk radiation to emerge
into polar directions, and more scattering radiation to emerge into all
directions. The wavelength-integrated flux, often interpreted as luminosity,
varies with viewing angle, with pole-on viewing angles seeing 2-4 times as much
flux as edge-on, depending on geometry. Thus, observational estimates of
luminosity should take into account the inclination of a source. The envelopes
with cavities are significantly bluer in near-IR and mid-IR color-color plots
than those without cavities. Using 1-D models to interpret Class I sources with
bipolar cavities would lead to an underestimate of envelope mass and an
overestimate of the implied evolutionary state. We compute images at near-,
mid-, and far-IR wavelengths. We find that the mid-IR colors and images are
sensitive to scattering albedo, and that the flared disk shadows the midplane
on large size scales at all wavelengths plotted. Finally, our models produce
polarization spectra which can be used to diagnose dust properties, such as
albedo variations due to grain growth. Our results of polarization across the
3.1 um ice feature agree well with observations for ice mantles covering 5% of
the radius of the grains.

on large scales, and with sufficiently reduced power on small scales to solve
the halo concentration and substructure problems. These include a tilted model,
the WMAP running-index model, and a Warm Dark Matter model. We assume that the
Universe was reionized by stellar sources comprised of a combination of
supermassive (~200 M_sun) Pop III stars and Pop II stars with a `normal' IMF.
We find that in all of these models, structure formation and hence reionization
occurs late, certainly at redshifts below ten, and more probably at z < 6. This
is inconsistent (at 2 sigma) with the determination of z_reion ~ 17 from the
WMAP temperature-polarization data and is only marginally consistent with SDSS
quasar observations. The tension between the galactic-scale observations, which
favor low-power models, and the early reionization favored by WMAP can only be
resolved if the efficiency of Pop III star formation is dramatically higher
than any current estimate, or if there is an exotic population of ionizing
sources such as mini-quasars. Otherwise, we may have to live with the standard
LCDM power spectrum, and solve the small-scale problems in some other way.

of this energy range, there is a strong case for a dedicated experiment to
study the EeV energy region with high precision. We present the conceptual
design of GRaNDScan, a mobile stereo air fluorescence detector optimized to
study the spectrum, composition, and arrival direction of cosmic rays in this
important energy range. If located at a site on the southern hemisphere with
good exposure to the Galactic center, this type of experiment will provide an
accurate map of the Galactic center region, long suspected to harbor one or
several sources of ultra high energy cosmic rays.

Ceti pulsator extensively studied with astroseismological techniques for last
three decades. The most recent determination of {\dot P} = (2.3 \pm 1.4) *
10^{-15} s/s^{-1} for the 215.2s fundamental mode agrees very well with
predictions of the best fit theoretical model. The rate of change of the
oscillation period can be explained by two effects: the cooling (dominant
factor) and change of gravitational binding energy (residual gravitational
contraction). Since the white dwarfs are pulsating in g-modes whose frequencies
are related to the Brunt-Vaisala frequency (explicitly dependent on G)
observational determination of the change of the period (more precisely the
difference between observed and calculated \dot P) can be used to set the upper
bound on the rate of change of G. In the light of the current data concerning
G117-B15A we derive the following bound: |{\frac {\dot G}{G}}| \leq 4.10 \times
10^{-10} yr^{-1}. Our result is model independent in the sense that it does not
need to invoke a concrete physical theory (such like Brans-Dicke
theory)underlying the temporal variability of G. We also demonstrate that
varying gravitational constant G does not modify cooling of white dwarfs in a
significant way. This result implies that some earlier claims present in the

not correct.

the origin of the apical deformation of the CuO${_{6}}^{-10}$ cluster is not
due to a pure JT effect, having therefore a non {\it a priori} condition to
remove the degeneracy of the electronic ground state of the parent regular
octahedron. We present a comparative analysis of the symmetry classified

Hartree-Fock calculations (UHF). Both the DFT and UHF calculations produced a
non degenerate electronic ground state, not having therefore the necessary

suggests the possibility for a PJT effect responsible for a local distortion of

the main features of the 2D melting transition and investigate the respective

thermodynamic, statistical and structural quantities as a function of the
relative populations of geometrical and topological defects. The model exhibits
a rich phase behavior including hexagonal and square crystals, expanded

solid--liquid transition temperature is lowered by a factor 3 to 4, with
respect to the case when only topological defects are allowed, when both
topological and geometrical defects are permitted, supporting our hypothesis
concerning the central role played by the geometrical defects in the melting.
The microscopic structure of the dense liquid has been investigated and the

emergence of this value is different in both classes of models. In particular,
for an entropically governed dynamics (where the perturbing field shifts the

perturbed rates are argued to take a form that guarantees the existence of a
limiting value for the effective temperature, utterly related to the
exponential character of the distribution of trap energies.

broad class of glassy systems, reinforcing the idea that structural glasses
self-generate a dynamical measure that is captured by phenomenological trap

energy strongly localized ``discrete'' kink-solitons (DK), which move with
supersonic velocities that are proportional to kink amplitudes. For small
amplitudes, the DK's of the FPU lattice reduce to the well-known ``continuous''
kink-soliton solutions of the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. For high
amplitudes, we obtain a consistent description of these DK's in terms of
approximate solutions of the lattice equations that are obtained by restricting
to a bounded support in space exact solutions with sinusoidal pattern
characterized by the ``magic'' wavenumber $k=2\pi/3$. Relative displacement
patterns, velocity versus amplitude, dispersion relation and exponential tails
found in numerical simulations are shown to agree very well with analytical
predictions, for both FPU and LJ lattices.

comparing the PES spectra with band structure calculations, a distinctive peak
at the Fermi level (E$_F$) with predominantly (Fe+Mo) t$_{2g}^\downarrow$

investigated. Moreover, we show that the electron doping due to the La

t$_{2g}^\downarrow$ metallic spin channel. Consequently, a gradual rising of
the density of states at the E$_F$ has been observed as a function of the La
doping. By changing the incoming photon energy we have shown that electron
doping mainly rises the density of states of Mo parentage. These findings
provide fundamental clues for understanding the origin of ferromagnetism in

open. By comparing them we can evaluate how far each theory has progressed, and
what must still be done before each theory can be considered a satisfactory
quantum theory of gravity. We find there has been impressive recent progress on
several fronts. At the same time, important issues about loop quantum gravity
are so far unresolved, as are key conjectures of string theory. However, there
is a reasonable expectation that experimental tests of lorentz invariance at
Planck scales may in the near future make it possible to rule out one or more
candidate quantum theories of gravity.

conjugation satisfies a modified tetrahedron equation (MTE) in which the
""rapidities"" are solutions of a classical integrable Hirota-type equation. The
matrix elements of this operator can be represented in terms of the
Bazhanov-Baxter Fermat curve cyclic functions, or alternatively in terms of
Gauss functions. The paper summarizes several recent publications on the

quantitative stochastic model of the actomyosin cycle based on the swinging
lever-arm hypothesis. We first consider a single pair of filaments, and show
that when values of parameters such as the lever-arm displacement and the
crossbridge elasticity are chosen to provide effective energy transduction, the
T2 curve (the tension recovered immediately after a step displacement) displays
a region of negative slope. If filament compliance and the discrete nature of
the binding sites are taken into account, the negative slope is diminished, but
not eliminated. This implies that there is an instability in the dynamics of
individual half-sarcomeres. However, when the symmetric nature of whole
sarcomeres is taken into account, filament rearrangement becomes important
during the transient: as tension is recovered, some half-sarcomeres lengthen
while others shorten. This leads to a flat T2 curve, as observed
experimentally. In addition, we investigate the isotonic transient response and
show that for a range of parameter values the model displays damped
oscillations, as recently observed in experiments on single muscle fibers. We
conclude that it is essential to consider the collective dynamics of many
sarcomeres, rather than the dynamics of a single pair of filaments, when
interpreting the transient response of muscle.

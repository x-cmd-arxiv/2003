spherically symmetric relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of
the interaction of a pulsar wind with the surrounding SNR, both in particle and
magnetically dominated regimes. As shown by previous simulations, the evolution
can be divided in three phases: free expansion, a transient phase characterized
by the compression and reverberation of the reverse shock, and a final Sedov
expansion. The evolution of the contact discontinuity between the PWN and the
SNR (and consequently of the SNR itself) is almost independent of the
magnetization of the nebula as long as the total (magnetic plus particle)
energy is the same. However, a different behaviour of the PWN internal
structure is observable during the compression-reverberation phase, depending
on the degree of magnetization=2E The simulations were performed using the
third order conservative scheme by Del Zanna et al. (2003).

static extra dimensions arise naturally during radiation domination. For matter
domination, however, there are no solutions to the field equations that allow
static extra dimensions or the usual behavior of the scale factor for ordinary

result, one can propagate this better-sampled background spectrum through
inverses of the distortion and rectification transformations, and accurately
model the background spectrum in two-dimensional spectra for which the
distortions have not been removed (i.e. the data have not been

insensitive to cosmic rays, hot pixels, etc. Because of this insensitivity to

cold, stationary and axisymmetric outflows. Our novel procedure is to treat the
wind equation as an algebraic relation between the relativistic Alfv\'{e}n
Mach-number and the poloidal electric to toroidal magnetic field amplitudes
ratio $\xi$.
  This allows us to obtain easily the wind solutions for
trans-fast-magnetosonic flows, together with the required range of
  $\xi$. Then, to determine the spatial variation of $\xi$, we solve
approximately the Grad-Shafranov equation applied to a jet flow ejected with a
very large total specific energy $E$ and confined within a very small opening
angle. Our trans-fast-magnetosonic model provides a closed-form expression for
the transition from a magnetically dominated flow to a kinetic-energy dominated
one, which occurs in the sub-asymptotic region far beyond the light cylinder of
the radius
  $R_{\rm L}$. Importantly, we find that the equipartition between magnetic and

realized on the Maxwell field strength. In the new setting, the same symmetry
acts as linear U(1) transformations of the auxiliary field variables. The

Lagrangian model is used which describes well the elementary reaction. The

found that the influence of rescattering effects on total and differential
cross sections is significant. Inclusion of such effects leads to an improved
and quite satisfactory agreement with experiment. Since several experiments to
measure the spin asymmetry of the total photoabsorption cross section, which
determines the GDH sum rule, are now being performed or planned at different
laboratories, the contribution of incoherent pion photoproduction to the spin
asymmetry for the deuteron is evaluated with inclusion of NN and PiN

theoretical models for CF, including unusual nuclear and exotic chemical
hypotheses. We conclude that they do not explain the data.

  vol. 3, Nova Science Publishers",,,,"physics.optics",,"  The statistical properties of nonlinear phase noise, often called the
Gordon-Mollenauer effect, is studied analytically when the number of fiber
spans is very large. The joint characteristic functions of the nonlinear phase
noise with electric field, received intensity, and the phase of amplifier noise
are all derived analytically. Based on the joint characteristic function of
nonlinear phase noise with the phase of amplifier noise, the error probability
of signal having nonlinear phase noise is calculated using the Fourier series
expansion of the probability density function. The error probability is
increased due to the dependence between nonlinear phase noise and the phase of
amplifier noise. When the received intensity is used to compensate the
nonlinear phase noise, the optimal linear and nonlinear minimum mean-square
error compensators are derived analytically using the joint characteristic
function of nonlinear phase noise and received intensity. Using the joint
probability density of received amplitude and phase, the optimal maximum a
posteriori probability detector is derived analytically. The nonlinear
compensator always performs better than linear compensator.

  2003","10.1073/pnas.1136844100",,"physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph",,"  Water plays a key role in biological membrane transport. In ion channels and
water-conducting pores (aquaporins), one dimensional confinement in conjunction
with strong surface effects changes the physical behavior of water. In
molecular dynamics simulations of water in short (0.8 nm) hydrophobic pores the
water density in the pore fluctuates on a nanosecond time scale. In long
simulations (460 ns in total) at pore radii ranging from 0.35 nm to 1.0 nm we
quantify the kinetics of oscillations between a liquid-filled and a
vapor-filled pore. This behavior can be explained as capillary evaporation
alternating with capillary condensation, driven by pressure fluctuations in the
water outside the pore. The free energy difference between the two states
depends linearly on the radius. The free energy landscape shows how a
metastable liquid state gradually develops with increasing radius. For radii
larger than ca. 0.55 nm it becomes the globally stable state and the vapor
state vanishes. One dimensional confinement affects the dynamic behavior of the
water molecules and increases the self diffusion by a factor of two to three
compared to bulk water. Permeabilities for the narrow pores are of the same
order of magnitude as for biological water pores. Water flow is not continuous
but occurs in bursts. Our results suggest that simulations aimed at collective
phenomena such as hydrophobic effects may require simulation times longer than
50 ns. For water in confined geometries, it is not possible to extrapolate from
bulk or short time behavior to longer time scales.

consider the possibility of using encoded ancilla in order to reduce the

we can conclude that the two parties must exchange Omega(n^{1/3}) qubits. This,
however, falls short of the optimal Omega(sqrt{n}) lower bound shown by
Razborov.)

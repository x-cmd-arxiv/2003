outbursts that eject stellar material into space. In 2002, the previously
unknown variable star V838 Monocerotis brightened suddenly by a factor of about
10^4. Unlike a supernova or nova, V838 Mon did not explosively eject its outer
layers; rather, it simply expanded to become a cool supergiant with a
moderate-velocity stellar wind. Superluminal light echoes were discovered as
light from the outburst propagated into surrounding, pre-existing circumstellar
dust. Here we report high-resolution imaging and polarimetry of the light
echoes, which allow us to set direct geometric distance limits to the object.
At a distance of >6 kpc, V838 Mon at its maximum brightness was temporarily the
brightest star in the Milky Way. The presence of the circumstellar dust implies
that previous eruptions have occurred, and spectra show it to be a binary
system. When combined with the high luminosity and unusual outburst behavior,
these characteristics indicate that V838 Mon represents a hitherto unknown type
of stellar outburst, for which we have no completely satisfactory physical
explanation.

transient positions and the HST images reveal the XRFs to be associated with
faint blue galaxies. Photometric evidence of these putative hosts suggests that
these two XRFs originated from redshifts less than z ~ 3.5, and thus cannot be
due to GRBs at very high redshifts. In both host-burst offsets and host
properties, these XRFs could have been drawn from distributions similar to
those measured of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We conclude with a discussion of the
implications of this XRF-GRB host connection for the possible progenitors of

confronted to the spatial and velocity distributions of all HI and H2 clouds
found within a few hundred parsecs from the Sun and to the Hipparcos distances
of the nearby OB associations. The model describes the expansion of a shock
wave that sweeps momentum from the ambient medium and it includes the effects
of the Galactic differential rotation and its gravitational torque, as well as
interstellar density gradients within and away from the Galactic plane,
possible fragmentation and drag forces in the late stages, and an initial
rotation of the system. The best fit to the data yields values for the current
Belt semi-axes of 373 +- 5 pc and 233 +- 5 pc, and an inclination of 17.2 +-
0.5 degrees, in agreement with earlier results. A different Belt orientation,
however, results from new H2 data and distance information. The present Belt
rim is found to coincide with most of the nearby OB associations and H2 clouds,
but its expansion bears little relation to the average association velocities.
An initial kinetic energy of (1.0 +- 0.1) 10^(45) J and an expansion age of
26.4 +- 0.4 Myr are required, in agreement with earlier 2D estimates. The
factor of 2 discrepancy between the Belt dynamical age and its stellar nuclear
age could not be solved by adding a vertical dimension in the expansion, drag
forces, fragmentation, or an initial rotation. Allowing the Belt to cross the
Galactic disc in the early stages requires a longer age of 52 Myr, but yields a
very poor fit to the data.

precession axis is fixed, time-symmetric pulsing constrains the set of possible
gates to those which, when combined with single qubit rotations, can be used in
a simple CNOT construction. Deviations from time-symmetric pulsing spoil this
construction. The effect of time asymmetry is studied by numerically
integrating the Schr\""odinger equation using parameters appropriate for GaAs

shown to be proportional to dimensionless measures of both spin-orbit coupling

that the string field theory action for fluctuation fields around this
classical solution can be mapped to the string field theory action defined
through the new boundary conformal field theory that arises from the original
one through the marginal deformation inserted on the world-sheet boundary.

lifetime of 3 fs. Adding electronegative fluorine ligands to form xenon
fluoride molecules, results in withdrawal of valence-electron density from Xe.
Thus, within the one-center picture of Auger decay, a lowered Xe 4d Auger width
would be expected, in contradiction, however, with experiment. Employing
extensive ab initio calculations within the framework of many-body Green's
functions, we determine all available decay channels in XeFn and characterize
these channels by means of a two-hole population analysis. We derive a relation
between two-hole population numbers and partial Auger widths. On this basis,
interatomic electronic decay processes are demonstrated to be so strong in the
xenon fluorides that they overcompensate the reduction in intra-atomic Auger
width and lead to the experimentally observed trend. The nature of the relevant
processes is discussed. These processes presumably underlie Auger decay in a
variety of systems.

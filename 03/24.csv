during inflation act together with scale-invariant adiabatic gaussian
fluctuations as seeds for the formation of large-scale structure. This model
agrees with most recent observations of the anisotropies of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) and can account for the excess of power measured on
cluster scales by the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI), the large empty regions
apparent in nearby galaxy redshift surveys and the number of giant arcs
measured in deep cluster lensing surveys. We show that the z=0 cluster mass
function differs from predictions for a standard LCDM cosmology with the same
sigma_8. Moreover, as massive clusters also form much earlier in the ""void""
scenario, we show that integrated number counts of SZ sources and simple
statistics of strong lensing can easily falsify this model.

stars, which may still be experiencing infall from their parent cloud cores.
Yet theory predicts that, early in this buildup, any outgoing wind is trapped
by incoming material of low angular momentum. As collapse continues and brings
in more rapidly rotating gas, the wind can eventually break out. Here we model
this transition by following the motion of the shocked shell created by impact
of the wind and a rotating, collapsing envelope. We first demonstrate, both
analytically and numerically, that our previous, quasi-static solutions are
dynamically unstable. Our present, fully time-dependent calculations include
cases both where the wind is driven back by infall to the stellar surface, and
where it erupts as a true outflow. For the latter, we find that the time of
breakout is sim 50,000 yr for wind speeds of 200 km/s. The reason for the delay
is that the shocked material, including the swept-up infall, must be able to
climb out of the star's gravitational potential well.
  We explore the critical wind speed necessary for breakout as a function of
the mass transport rates in the wind and infall, as well as the cloud rotation
rate Omega0 and time since the start of infall. Breakout does occur for
realistic parameter choices. The actual breakout times would change if we
relaxed the assumption of perfect mixing between the wind and infall material.
Our expanding shells do not exhibit the collimation of observed jets, but
continue to expand laterally. To halt this expansion, the density in the
envelope must fall off less steeply than in our model.

controversial topic. M87, the nearest such object, is puzzling in that although
it has very massive central black hole it has a relatively low luminosity,
suggesting it is in a dormant state. Despite of its proximity to us (16 Mpc) it
is not known with certainty whether or not M87 has a dusty torus.
  Infrared observations indicate that if a torus exists in M87 it must have a
rather low infrared luminosity. Using arguments from unification theory of
active galactic nuclei, we have earlier suggested that the inner parsec-scale
region of M87 could still harbour a small torus sufficiently cold such that its
infrared emission is dwarfed by the jet emission. The infrared emission from
even a small cold torus could affect through photon-photon pair production
interactions the escape of 100 GeV to TeV energy gamma rays from the central
parsec of M87.
  The TeV gamma-ray flux from the inner jet of M87 has recently been predicted
in the context of the Synchrotron Proton Blazar (SPB) model to extend up to at
least 100 GeV (Protheroe, Donea, Reimer, 2002). Subsequently, the detection of
gamma-rays above 730 GeV by the HEGRA Cherenkov telescopes has been reported.
We discuss the interactions of gamma-rays produced in the inner jet of M87 with
the weak infrared radiation expected from a possible dusty small-scale torus,
and show that the HEGRA detection shows that the temperature of any torus
surrounding the gamma-ray emission region must be cooler than about 250 K. We
suggest that if no gamma-rays are in future detected during extreme flaring
activity in M87 at other wavelength, this may be expected because of torus
heating.

pairwise velocity dispersions (PVD) that are about 400 km/s too high at
projected pair separations of ~1 Mpc/h. A strong velocity bias in massive
haloes can reduce the predicted PVD to the observed level, but does not help to
resolve the over-prediction of clustering power on small scales. Consistent

on the Hipparcos proper motion and parallax combined with the known absolute
radial velocity of the star. When the RV data of the last half-year are added
the best-fit slope is strongly reduced to 2.97+/-0.51 m/s/yr suggesting the
presence of additional RV variability in the star. Part of it can be attributed
to stellar activity as we demonstrate by correlating the residual RVs with an
index that describes the filling-in of the Halpha line by emission. A
correlation coefficient of -0.50 indicates that the appearance of active

fractions) rather well. In particular, we find that once the effects of dust
and variations in stellar populations have been taken into account, published
spiral galaxy scale-size distributions derived from optical data (with
logarithmic widths ~0.3) can be reconciled with the width of the stellar mass
scale-size distribution predicted by the semi-analytic model (~0.5). There are
some illuminating discrepancies between the observations and the model
predictions. The model colours of luminous spiral galaxies are somewhat too
blue and those of faint galaxies somewhat too red, most likely indicating
shortcomings in the way that gas is accreted by spiral galaxies. Furthermore,
the model produces too few luminous spiral galaxies. These difficulties could
be resolved by altering the way in which gas cooling is treated or, perhaps, by
adopting a higher baryon fraction and invoking galactic `superwinds.' Secondly,
stellar M/Ls are found to be as high as observations permit. Yet, typically 60%
of the mass in the inner half-light radius of the model galaxies is dark. This
results in an offset between the model and observed spiral galaxy
luminosity-linewidth relation. This could be resolved by substantially reducing
the mass of baryons which make it into a galaxy disc (with an attendant
decrease in stellar M/L), or by modifying the assumed dark matter profile to
include less dark matter in the inner parts. [Abridged]

its connectivity. Therefore, preferential attachment governs the protein
network evolution. The evolutionary mechanism leading to such preference and

Einstein-de Sitter Universe in the matter dominated epoch assuming an ideal gas
equation of state. For the sake of simplicity the temperature is considered
uniform. The goal of the paper is to examine the validity of the linear
approximation. With this purpose the evolution equations are developed
including quadratic terms in the derivatives of the metric perturbations and
using coordinate conditions that, in the linear case, reduce to the
longitudinal gauge. We obtain the general solution, in the coordinate space, of
the evolution equation for the scalar mode, and, in the case of spherical
symmetry, we express this solution in terms of unidimensional integrals of the
initial conditions: the initial values of the Newtonian potential and its first
time derivative. We find that the contribution of the initial first time
derivative, which has been systematically forgotten, allows to form
inhomogeneities similar to a cluster of galaxies starting with very small
density contrast. Finally, we obtain the first non linear correction to the
linearized solution due to the quadratic terms in the evolution equations. Here
we find that a non null pressure plays a crucial role in constraining the non
linear corrections. It is shown, by means of examples, that reasonable thermal
velocities at the present epoch (non bigger than $10^{-6}$) make the ratio
between the first non linear correction and the linear solution of the order of
$10^{-2}$ for a galaxy cluster inhomogeneity.

studied. The charm to tensor meson transition form factors are evaluated in the
Isgur-Scora-Grinstein-Wise (ISGW) quark model. It is shown that the
Cabibbo-allowed decay $D_s^+\to f_2(1270)\pi^+$ is dominated by the
W-annihilation contribution and has the largest branching ratio in $D\to TP$
decays. We argue that the Cabibbo-suppressed mode $D^+\to f_2(1270)\pi^+$
should be suppressed by one order of magnitude relative to $D_s^+\to
f_2(1270)\pi^+$. When the finite width effect of the tensor resonances is taken
into account, the decay rate of $D\to TP$ is generally enhanced by a factor of
$2\sim 3$. Except for $D_s^+\to f_2(1270)\pi^+$, the predicted branching ratios
of $D\to TP$ decays are in general too small by one to two orders of magnitude
compared to experiment. However, it is very unlikely that the $D\to T$
transition form factors can be enhanced by a factor of $3\sim 5$ within the
ISGW quark model to account for the discrepancy between theory and experiment.
As many of the current data are still preliminary and lack sufficient statistic
significance, more accurate measurements are needed to pin down the issue.

from SND and CMD-2 at VEPP-2M at Novosibirsk. We show how the coupling of the

processes as required by unitarity. We find that the resulting coupling for the

unlike that assumed if unitarity is neglected. This provides an object lesson
in how unitarity teaches us to add resonances. Not surprisingly the result is
crucially dependent on the pole position of the f_0(980), for which there are
still sizeable uncertainties. At present this leads to an uncertainty in the
phi -> f_0 gamma branching ratio which can only be fixed by further precision

layered (varved) deposits of a landslide dammed lake in the Santa Maria Basin

precipitation variability during this time. The comparison of these data with
present-day rainfall observations tests the hypothesis that increased rainfall
variability played a major role in landslide generation. A potential cause of
such variability is the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The causal link
between ENSO and local rainfall is quantified by using a new method of
nonlinear data analysis, the quantitative analysis of cross recurrence plots
(CRP). This method seeks similarities in the dynamics of two different
processes, such as an ocean-atmosphere oscillation and local rainfall. Our
analysis reveals significant similarities in the statistics of both modern and
palaeo-precipitation data. The similarities in the data suggest that an
ENSO-like influence on local rainfall was present at around 30,000 14C years
ago. Increased rainfall, which was inferred from a lake balance modeling in a
previous study, together with ENSO-like cyclicities could help to explain the
clustering of landslides at around 30,000 14C years ago.

now been measured with high precision ($\pm$5% or better) by different groups
and good agreement is found, even when very different methods are employed. We
review the decade long research program to measure the cross section of the
$^7Be(p,\gamma)^8B$ reaction using the Coulomb dissociation method, including
the pioneering RIKEN1 experiment carried out during March 1992, followed by
RIKEN2, GSI1, GSI2 and an MSU experiment. Our RIKEN and GSI data allow us to
rule out the much tooted large E2 contribution to the Coulomb dissociation of
$^8B$. Specifically recent results of the MSU experiment are not confirmed. The
GSI1 and GSI2 high precision measurements are in good (to perfect) agreement
with the newly published high precision measurements of direct capture with
$^7Be$ targets. From these GSI-Seattle-Weizmann high precision data we conclude
that the astrophysical cross section factor, $S_{17}(0)$, is most likely in the
range of 20 - 22 eV-b. We point out to an additional large uncertainty (-10%
+3%) that still exists due to uncertainty in the measured slope of the S-factor
and the theoretical extrapolation procedure which may still lower $S_{17}(0)$
down to approximately 18.5 eV-b. For quoting $S_{17}(0)$ with an uncertainty of
$\pm$5% or better, yet another measurement needs to be performed at very low
energies, as recently discussed by the UConn-Weizmann-LLN collaboration for the
CERN/ISOLDE facility.

branching ratios of near-threshold states in 19Ne. Populating these states
using the (p,t) reaction in inverse kinematics, we detected the recoils and
their decay products with 100% geometric efficiency using a magnetic
spectrometer. Combining our branching ratio measurements with independent
determinations of the radiative widths of these states, we calculate the
astrophysical rate of 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne. Using this reaction rate, we
perform hydrodynamic calculations of nova outbursts and conclude that no
significant breakout from the hot CNO cycles into the rp process occurs in
novae via 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne.

Rev. Lett",,"10.1016/j.physd.2004.03.008",,"physics.bio-ph q-bio",,"  We investigate a map-based model of paced cardiac muscle in the presence of
closed-loop feedback control. The model relates the duration of an action
potential to the preceding diastolic interval as well as the preceding action
potential duration and thus has some amount of `memory.' We find that the
domain of control depends on this memory, independently of the specific
functional form of the map. The memory-dependent domain of control can
encompass large feedback gains, thus providing the first possible explanation
of the recent experimental results of Hall et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett, 88, 198102
(2002)] on controlling alternans in small pieces of rapidly-paced cardiac
muscle.

SU(1,1) group with time-dependent coefficients is studied. It is shown that
there is a unitary relation between the system and a system whose Hamiltonian
is simply proportional to the generator of the compact subgroup of the SU(1,1).
The unitary relation is described by the classical solutions of a
time-dependent (harmonic) oscillator. Making use of the relation, the wave
functions satisfying the Schr\""{o}dinger equation are given for a general
unitary representation in terms of the matrix elements of a finite group
transformation (Bargmann function). The wave functions of the harmonic
oscillator with an inverse-square potential is studied in detail, and it is
shown that, through an integral, the model provides a way of deriving the
Bargmann function for the representation of positive discrete series of the
SU(1,1).

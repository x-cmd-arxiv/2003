companion star is either a B3-A2 main sequence star, or a B3-A2 sub-giant
crossing the Hertzsprung gap. The system is therefore an Intermediate or High

modulated by the effects of a highly ionized wind. WZ Sge is fainter in later
observations (starting about 45 days after optical maximum) and increasingly
""red"" in the far ultraviolet. The spectral shape increasingly resembles that
expected from a metal-enriched white dwarf photosphere, although it seems
likely that some disk contribution remains at least through the second FUSE
observation, when the visible light curve showed the system to be undergoing a
rebrightening event. The absorption lines observed on 29 September and in early
November, when the visible light curve was in a fairly steady decline toward
quiescence, are narrow, with widths (FWHM) of order 0.7-1.3 Ang. (200-400
km/s). The most natural explanation for these spectra is that the continuum
arises from a relatively massive, slowly rotating white dwarf, and that the
lines are created by a combination of metals in the atmosphere and of absorbing
material along the line of sight to the white dwarf. If the white dwarf has
log{g}= 8.5, then the white dwarf cooled from ~25,000 K on 29 September to

blue compact galaxies by analyzing their continuum spectra and the equivalent
widths of strong stellar absorption features using a technique of empirical
population synthesis based on a library of observed star-cluster spectra. Our
results indicate that blue compact galaxies are typically age-composite stellar
systems; in addition to young stars, intermediate-age and old stars contribute
significantly to the 5870 A continuum emission of most galaxies in our sample.
The stellar populations of blue compact galaxies also span a variety of
metallicities. The ongoing episodes of star formation started typically less
than a billion years ago. Some galaxies may be undergoing their first global
episode of star formation, while for most galaxies in our sample, older stars
are found to contribute up to half the optical emission. Our results suggest
that BCGs are primarily old galaxies with discontinuous star formation
histories. The absorption equivalent widths measured in the synthetic spectra
range from typically 1.5 A for Halpha, to 2 -- 5 A for Hbeta, Hgamma, and

structural effects of a solid core and of internal heating due to the
conversion of kinetic to thermal energy at pressures of tens of bars. The model
planetary radii are intended for comparisons with radii derived from
observations of transiting extrasolar planets. To provide such comparisons, we
expect that of order 10 transiting planets with orbital periods less than 200
days can be detected around bright (V<10) main-sequence stars for which
accurate, well-sampled radial velocity measurements can be readily accumulated.
Through these observations, structural properties of the planets will be
derivable, particularly for low-mass, high-temperature planets. Implications
regarding the transiting companion to OGLE-TR-56 recently announced by Konacki
et al. are discussed.
  With regard to the confirmed transiting planet, HD 209458b, we find, in
accordance with other recent calculations, that models without internal heating
predict a radius that is 35 percent smaller than the observed radius. We
explore the possibility that HD 209458b owes its large size to dissipation of
energy arising from ongoing tidal circularization of the orbit. We show that
residual scatter in the current radial velocity data set for HD 209458b is
consistent with the presence of an as-of-yet undetected second companion, and
that further radial velocity monitoring of the star is indicated.

analysis of CS 22892-052, an extremely metal-poor giant with large relative
enhancements of neutron-capture elements. A revised model stellar atmosphere
has been derived with the aid of a large number of Fe-peak transitions,
including both neutral and ionized species of six elements.Several elements,
including Mo, Lu, Au, Pt and Pb, have been detected for the first time in CS
22892-052, and significant upper limits have been placed on the abundances of
Ga, Ge, Cd, Sn, and U in this star. In total, abundance measurements or upper
limits have been determined for 57 elements, far more than previously possible.
New Be and Li detections in CS 22892-052 indicate that the abundances of both
these elements are significantly depleted compared to unevolved main-sequence
turnoff stars of similar metallicity. Abundance comparisons show an excellent
agreement between the heaviest n-capture elements (Z >= 56) and scaled solar
system r-process abundances, confirming earlier results for CS 22892-052 and
other metal-poor stars. New theoretical r-process calculations also show good
agreement with CS 22892-052 abundances as well as the solar r-process abundance
components.The abundances of lighter elements (40<= Z <= 50), however, deviate
from the same scaled abundance curves that match the heavier elements,
suggesting different synthesis conditions or sites for the low-mass and
high-mass ends of the abundance distribution. The detection of Th and the upper
limit on the U abundance together imply a lower limit of 10.4 Gyr on the age of
CS 22892-052, quite consistent with the Th/Eu age estimate of 12.8 +/- ~= 3
Gyr. An average of several chronometric ratios yields an age 14.2 +/- ~= 3 Gyr.

luminosity, the Eddington ratio can also be obtained. We confirmed the strong
anti-correlation between X-ray variability and the central black mass founded
by Lu & Yu. We further found that narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) also
follow this relation with a larger scatter and there is only a weak correlation
between the X-ray variability and the Eddington ratio, which suggest that rapid
variability and narrow lines in NLS1s are mainly due to small central black
holes in NLS1s, not the difference of circumnuclear gas around NLS1s. A strong
correlation was found between the hard X-ray photon index and the Eddington
ratio. If the suggestion of two distinct accretion classes, namely ADAF and
thin disk accretion, in AGNs (Lu & Yu) is correct, the strong photon
index-Eddington ration correlation showed that there exists a kind of two zone
accretion disk, in which the outer zone is a thin disk, and the inner zone is
an ADAF disk. Otherwise, the accretion process is the thin disk accretion and

exponential time-scale is approximately equal to the thermal timescale of the
standard accretion disk, we obtain the accretion rate, the size of soft x-ray

than twofold. We comment on the detectability of the variable stars in previous

detached eclipsing binaries (DEB) in the Small Magellanic Cloud, discovered by
OGLE collaboration, on the basis of recently available difference image
analysis (DIA) photometry. The 19 binaries brighter than 16.4 mag in I band and
with the depth of primary and secondary eclipse greater than 0.25 mag were
investigated. The solutions were obtained by a modified version of the
Wilson-Devinney program. The quality of DIA light curves - a good phase
coverage and relatively small scatter - is enough to calculate realistic
estimates for the third light l_3 and the argument of periastron. It was found
that solutions of detached, eccentric systems with flat light curve between
eclipses usually may suffer from indetermination of l_3 in contrast to those of
similar systems having some proximity effects.
  The physical properties of the stars were estimated on the basis of their
photometric elements and indices assuming the distance modulus to SMC ~18.9 and
consistency between an empirical mass-luminosity relation and the flux scaling.
The method was tested on three LMC stars of known absolute dimensions and a
good agreement was found for m-M ~18.5. Such an approach may give fast and
accurate estimates of absolute dimensions for large and homogeneous samples of
eclipsing binaries in the Magellanic Clouds and other close galaxies. Moreover,
this method allows also for independent estimation of E(B-V) in the direction
to a particular binary. The subset of six bright DEB's worth future intensive
investigations as likely distance indicators to SMC, was chosen. They are SC3
139376, SC4 53898, SC5 129441, SC6 67221, SC6 215965 and SC9 175336.

is small, \Gamma < 2\Delta_0, so that the materials are not in the dirty limit

originates from a Fermi liquid normal state. In the underdoped material the
larger energy scale may be a result of the non-Fermi liquid nature of the

of the normal state creates specific conditions for observing the different
aspects of what is presumably a central mechanism for superconductivity in

  Reaction-diffusion systems are paradigmatic examples of non-equilibrium
systems. Their long-time behaviour is strongly influenced through fluctuation
effects in low dimensions which renders the habitual mean-field cinetic
equations inapplicable. Starting from the master equation rewritten as a
Schr\""odinger equation with imaginary time, the associated quantum hamiltonian
of certain one-dimensional reaction-diffusion models is closely related to
integrable magnetic chains. The relationship with the Hecke algebra and its
quotients allows to identify integrable reaction-diffusion models and, through
the Baxterization procedure, relate them to the solutions of Yang-Baxter
equations which can be solved via the Bethe ansatz. Methods such as spectral
and partial integrability, free fermions, similarity transformations or
diffusion algebras are reviewed, with several concrete examples treated
explicitly. An outlook on how the recently-introduced concept of local scale
invariance might become useful in the description of non-equilibrium ageing
phenomena is presented, with particular emphasis on the kinetic Ising model
with Glauber dynamics.

with lambda the electron-phonon coupling and J_AF the antiferromagnetic
exchange between classical t_2g spins. The results include standard phases,
such as the CE-insulating and FM-metallic regimes, but they also unveil novel
states, such as a ferromagnetic charge-ordered (CO) orbital-ordered phase
compatible with recent experimental results by Loudon et al. (ii) For realistic
couplings, it was observed that the charge disproportionation delta of the CO
phase is far from the widely accepted extreme limit delta=0.5 of a 3+/4+ charge
separation. A far smaller delta appears more realistic, in agreement with
recent experiments by Garcia et al. and Daoud-Aladine it et al. (iii) Colossal
magnetoresistance (CMR) effects are found in calculations of cluster
resistances using the Landauer formalism. This occurs near the ubiquitous
first-order phase transitions between the insulating and metallic states. (iv)
The CE-state is found to be (very sensitive to disorder) since its long-range
order rapidly disappears when quenched-disorder is introduced, contrary to the
FM state which is more robust. This is also in qualitative agreement with
recent experiments by Akahoshi et al. and Nakajima et al. (v) The phase diagram
in the half-doped (electron doping) regime is briefly discussed as well. A
charge-ordered state is found which is the analog of the x=0.5 CE phase. It
contains a 3+/2+ charge arrangement at large lambda.

transition of the onset of slow dynamics at T_0, alteration of the nature of
motion from the saddle-to-saddle to minimum-to-minimum motion at T_c, and an
ideal glass transition at T_k. If the energy spectrum of the configurations has
a low energy tail, the model also allows a thermodynamic liquid-liquid
transition at T_l. The liquid-liquid transition of the model is correlated to
the kinetic fragile-strong transition accompanied by the anomalous slowing down
of motion. Fragility of the system is classified in terms of features of the
energy landscape such as ruggedness of the potential energy surface, size of
the cooperative motion invoked in a transition from one configuration to
another, and energy needed to deform the local structure in the cooperative
motion. A simple relation is found between diffusion constant, D and the saddle

turn out to be rather low, mainly due to Rayleigh scattering and to the
relatively large dead space between the photocathodes. A light collection

better quality aerogels are expected to improve the situation. The reduction of

to a saturation of partonic distributions. When the scale corresponding to the
density per unit transverse area, the saturation scale Q_s, becomes large
(Q_s\gg \Lambda_{QCD}), the coupling constant becomes weak (\alpha_S(Q_s)\ll 1)
which suggests that the high energy limit of QCD may be studied using weak
coupling techniques. This simple idea can be formalized in an effective theory,
the Color Glass Condensate (CGC), which describes the behavior of the small x
components of the hadronic wavefunction in QCD. The Green functions of the
theory satisfy Wilsonian renormalization group equations which reduce to the
standard linear QCD evolution equations in the limit of low parton densities.
The effective theory has a rich structure that has been explored using
analytical and numerical techniques. The CGC can be applied to study a wide

classify the latter according to their symmetry transformation properties as
well as the order at which they appear in a derivative expansion. We apply this
framework to several particle physics models, including R-parity violating
supersymmetry (RPV SUSY) and the left-right symmetric model (LRSM) with mixing
and a right-handed Majorana neutrino. We show that, in general, the pion
exchange contributions to $\nbb$-decay dominate over the short-range
four-nucleon operators. This confirms previously published RPV SUSY results and
allows us to derive new constraints on the masses in the LRSM. In particular,
we show how a non-zero mixing angle $\zeta$ in the left-right symmetry model
produces a new potentially dominant contribution to $\nbb$-decay that
substantially modifies previous limits on the masses of the right-handed

sensitive to a galactic supernova (SN) neutrino burst. The Cherenkov light
corresponding to the total energy deposited by the SN neutrinos in the ice can
be measured relative to background fluctuations with a statistical precision
much better than 1%. If the SN is viewed through the Earth, the matter effect
on neutrino oscillations can change the signal by more than 5%, depending on
the flavor-dependent source spectra and the neutrino mixing parameters.
Therefore, IceCube together with another high-statistics experiment like
Hyper-Kamiokande can detect the Earth effect, an observation that would
identify specific neutrino mixing scenarios that are difficult to pin down with
long-baseline experiments. In particular, the normal mass hierarchy can be
clearly detected if the third mixing angle is not too small, sin^2 theta_13 <
10^-3. The small flavor-dependent differences of the SN neutrino fluxes and
spectra that are found in state-of-the-art simulations suffice for this
purpose. Although the absolute calibration uncertainty at IceCube may exceed
5%, the Earth effect would typically vary by a large amount over the duration
of the SN signal, obviating the need for a precise calibration. Therefore,
IceCube with its unique geographic location and expected longevity can play a
decisive role as a ""co-detector"" to measure SN neutrino oscillations. It is
also a powerful stand-alone SN detector that can verify the delayed-explosion
scenario.

even-moded Virasoro and even(odd) moded super-Virasoro constraints to be
imposed in the NS(R) sectors. The Casimir energy is now positive in both
sectors; there are no tachyons. States for $\alpha' M^2 \leq 3$ are explicitly
constructed and found to be organized into SO(8) irreps by (super)constraints,
which include a novel ""$\sqrt{L_0}$"" operator in the NS and $\Gamma^0 \pm I$ in
the R sectors. GSO projections are not allowed. The pre-constraint states above
the ground state have matching multiplicities, indicating spacetime
supersymmetry is broken by the (super)constraints. A distinctive physical
signature of the system is a slope twice that of the open RNS string. When both
ends are fixed, all leading and subleading trajectories are eliminated,
resulting in a spectrum qualitatively similar to the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$
particles.

  (Catanzaro: Rubettino, 2001), pp. 11-18",,,,"math.LO",,"  The recapture relationship is an important element to any understanding of
the connexion between different systems of logic. Loosely speaking, one system
of logic recaptures another if it is possible to specify a subsystem of the
former system which exhibits the same patterns of inference as the latter
system. In particular if a relationship of this kind can be shown to exist
between a non-classical logic and classical logic, the non-classical system is
said to exhibit classical recapture. This has been invoked by several
proponents of non-classical logics to argue that their system retains classical
logic as a limit case, and is therefore a methodologically progressive
successor to classical logic. In this paper I advance and defend a new and more
precise account of recapture and the character of its reception by the
proponents of the recapturing system. I then indicate some of the applications
of classical recapture which this account makes possible.

configurations in the strong coupling phase are substantially more chaotic than
in the deconfinement phase. Considering the quantum case, complete eigenvalue
spectra of the Dirac operator in quenched 4d compact QED are studied on $8^3

of random-matrix theory indicating quantum chaos.

  Boundaries","24 pages, 20 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.68.066213",,"nlin.CD",,"  We analyze situations where a saddle-node bifurcation occurs on a fractal
basin boundary. Specifically, we are interested in what happens when a system
parameter is slowly swept in time through the bifurcation. Such situations are
known to be indeterminate in the sense that it is difficult to predict the
eventual fate of an orbit that tracks the pre-bifurcation node attractor as the
system parameter is swept through the bifurcation. In this paper we investigate
the scaling of (1) the fractal basin boundary of the static (i.e., unswept)
system near the saddle-node bifurcation, (2) the dependence of the orbit's
final destination on the sweeping rate, (3) the dependence of the time it takes
for an attractor to capture a swept orbit on the sweeping rate, and (4) the
dependence of the final attractor capture probability on the noise level. With
respect to noise, our main result is that the effect of noise scales with the
5/6 power of the parameter drift rate. Our approach is to first investigate all
these issues using one-dimensional map models. The simplification of treatment
inherent in one dimension greatly facilitates analysis and numerical
experiment, aiding us in obtaining the new results listed above. Following our
one-dimensional investigations, we explain that these results can be applied to
two-dimensional systems. We show, through numerical experiments on a
periodically forced second order differential equation example, that the
scalings we have found also apply to systems that result in two dimensional
maps.

independent of the emission mechanism and can be used to model both the rise

GRB pulses, allowing us to examine the fluence, pulse width, asymmetry, and
rise and decay power-law distributions. We find that the rise phase is best
modelled with a power law of average index $r = 1.31 \pm 0.11$ and that the
average decay phase has an index o.f $d = 2.39 \pm 0.12$. We also find that the
ratio between the rise and decay times (the pulse asymmetry) exhibited by the
GRB pulse shape has an average value of 0.47 which varies little from pulse to
pulse and is independent of pulse duration or intensity. We compare these
parameters with those predicted to occur if individual pulse shapes are created
purely by relativistic curvature effects in the context of the fireball model,
a process that makes specific predictions about the shape of GRB pulses. The
decay index distribution obtained from our sample shows that the average GRB
pulse fades faster than the value predicted by curvature effects, with only 39%
of our sample being consistent with the curvature model. We discuss several
refinements of the relativistic curvature scenario that could naturally account

are due to the horizontal motions associated with the g-mode pulsations on the
star. We detect seven pulsation modes from the velocity time-series and
identify the same modes in the flux variations. We discuss the properties of
these modes and use the advantage of having both velocity and flux measurements
of the pulsations to test the convective driving theory proposed for DAV stars.
Our data show limited agreement with the expected relationships between the
amplitude and phases of the velocity and flux modes. Unexpectedly, the velocity
curve shows evidence for harmonic distortion, in the form of a peak in the
Fourier transform whose frequency is the exact sum of the two largest
frequencies. Combination frequencies are a characteristic feature of the
Fourier transforms of light curves of G29-38, but before now have not been
detected in the velocities, nor does published theory predict that they should
exist. We compare our velocity combination frequency to combination frequencies
found in the analysis of light curves of G29-38, and discuss what might account
for the existence of velocity combinations with the properties we observe.
  We also use our high-resolution spectra to determine if either rotation or
pulsation can explain the truncated shape observed for the DAV star's line
core. We are able to eliminate both mechanisms: the average spectrum does not
fit the rotationally broadened model and the time-series of spectra provides
proof that the pulsations do not significantly truncate the line.

from M5 to M8, exhibit moderate to very strong H$\alpha$ emission. In half of
the IC 348 objects, the H$\alpha$ profiles are broad and asymmetric, indicative
of on-going accretion. Of these, IC348-355 (M8) is the lowest mass object to
date to show accretion-like H$\alpha$. Three of our ~M6 IC 348 targets with
broad H$\alpha$ also harbor broad OI (8446\AA) and CaII (8662\AA) emission, and
one shows broad HeI (6678\AA) emission; these features are usually seen in
strongly accreting classical T Tauri stars. We find that in very low mass
accretors, the H$\alpha$ profile may be somewhat narrower than that in higher
mass stars. We propose that low accretion rates combined with small infall
velocities at very low masses can conspire to produce this effect. In the
non-accretors in our sample, H$\alpha$ emission is commensurate with, or higher
than, saturated levels in field M dwarfs of similar spectral type. Our results
constitute the most compelling evidence to date that young brown dwarfs undergo
a T Tauri-like accretion phase similar to that in stars. This is consistent
with a common origin for most low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and isolated

the blueshifted CO outflow emerging from the protostar is located. In contrast
to the elongated envelope, those compact CH3OH condensations show much larger
line width (up to 2.0 km s-1) with centroid velocities blueshifted by ~ 0.8 km

the outflow and the ambient gas surrounding the protostar, and that such

between the electroweak transition and the primordial nucleosynthesis.
  The most dramatic event in that era is the quark--hadron transition at 10
$\mu$s. Quarks and gluons condense to form a gas of nucleons and light mesons,
the latter decay subsequently. At the end of the first second, neutrinos and
neutrons decouple from the radiation fluid. The quark--hadron transition and
dissipative processes during the first second prepare the initial conditions
for the synthesis of the first nuclei.
  As for the cold dark matter (CDM), WIMPs (weakly interacting massive
particles) -- the most popular candidates for the CDM -- decouple from the
presently known forms of matter, chemically (freeze-out) at 10 ns and
kinetically at 1 ms. The chemical decoupling fixes their present abundances and
dissipative processes during and after thermal decoupling set the scale for the
very first WIMP clouds.

two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), proved to be very powerful tools in
studying coherent wave-like phenomena in mesoscopic systems. However, they
suffer from small fringe visibility due to the many channels in each slit and
poor sensitivity to small currents due to their open geometry. Moreover, the
interferometers do not function in a high magnetic field, namely, in the
quantum Hall effect (QHE) regime, since it destroys the symmetry between left
and right slits. Here, we report on the fabrication and operation of a novel,
single channel, two-path electron interferometer that functions in a high
magnetic field. It is the first electronic analog of the well-known optical
Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer. Based on single edge state and closed
geometry transport in the QHE regime the interferometer is highly sensitive and
exhibits very high visibility (62%). However, the interference pattern decays
precipitously with increasing electron temperature or energy. While we do not
understand the reason for the dephasing we show, via shot noise measurement,
that it is not a decoherence process that results from inelastic scattering
events.

includes scattering and memory effects. From this starting point one is lead to
evolution equations for the propagator, which are nonlocal in time. Numerical
solutions showed that the propagator depends only very slightly on the center
coordinates already after moderate times, and that correlations between earlier
and later times are suppressed exponentially, which causes an effective memory
loss. Exploiting these two observations, we combine a first order gradient
expansion with a Wigner transformation to derive our kinetic equations, which
are local in time, from the nonlocal evolution equations. In contrast to
standard descriptions based on loop expansions, our kinetic equations remain
valid even for nonperturbatively large fluctuations. Additionally, employing a

the future-directed constraint before and after quantization. It is found that
this leads to different quantum theories. The Hilbert space of either theory
decomposes into the sum of certain irreducible representations of

mass occurs, although a continuum exists in the unconstrained theory

is a variant of the Cheeger constant; its positivity implies positive lower

in the infinite percolation cluster in Cayley graphs of certain amenable groups

space of all infinitesimal deformations has a representation as a direct sum of

the branch locus and the base of the double covering. The second summand is the
subspace of deformations of the double covering which induce trivial
deformations of the branch divisor. The main result of the paper is a
description of the effect of imposing singularities in the branch locus.
  As a special case we study deformations of Calabi--Yau threefolds which are
non--singular models of double cover of the projective 3--space branched along
an octic surface. We show that in that case the number of deformations can be
computed explicitly using computer algebra systems. This gives a method to
compute the Hodge numbers of these Calabi--Yau manifolds. In this case the
transverse deformations are resolutions of deformations of double covers of
projective space but not double covers of a blow--up of projective space. In

"physics/0303104","Enrique Ordaz Romay","Enrique Ordaz Romay","The Linear Momentum as a Tensor Function","15 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph physics.ed-ph",,"  At present, whenever we work in newtonian mechanics we consider momentum to
be a three-dimensional vector or a 4-dimensional one when we work in
relativistic mechanics. However, this mathematical vector model has barely 200
years and its complete installation in the physics is hardly more than 100
years old. In classical mechanics, based on point particles with mass, momentum
is considered as a vector because the speed of the particle is applied on a
single point and the mass is defined only at that point. When the extension to
classical rigid solids is made, that is, to solids that keep their shape, being
so that the speed is defined to be the same for each and every point where the
solid is defined, then the viewpoint of momentum as a vector is the simplest
and more convenient approach. Relativity (restricted and general) was developed
in the decades of 1900 and 1910 and quantum mechanics in the decades of 1920
and 1930. Relativity then impedes the existence of classical rigid solids. The
maximum speed for the transmission of signals prevents a body from varying its
status without being deformed. On the other hand, quantum physics breaks up
with the concept of point particles with mass, substituting this model for the
one of the wave function defined in an extensive region of the space
(space-time in the quantum relativity). Can we really define, the moment of a
relativistic solid or of a wave function with a simple vector?

the calculations. Reaction probabilities have also been calculated for several
values of the total angular momentum J > 0. Those have then been used to
estimate cross sections and rate constants for both channels. The calculated
cross sections can be compared with the results of previous quasiclassical
trajectory calculations and reaction dynamics experimental on the abstraction
channel. In addition, the calculated rate constants are in the reasonably good
agreement with experimental measurement.

presented a method to obtain a continuous transition from classical to quantum
mechanics starting from the usual phase space formulation of classical
mechanics. This procedure was based on a Koopman-von Neumann approach where
classical equations are reformulated into a quantumlike form. In this article,
we develop a different derivation of quantum equations, based on purely
classical stochastic arguments, taking some elements from the
Bohm-Fenyes-Nelson approach. This study starts from a remark noticed by
different authors [M. Born, Physics in My Generation (Pergamon Press, London,
1956); E. Prugovecki, Stochastic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Spacetime
(Reidel, Dordrecht, 1986)], suggesting that physical continuous observables are
stochastic by nature. Following this idea, we study how intrinsic stochastic
properties can be introduced into the framework of classical mechanics. Then we
analyze how the quantum theory can emerge from this modified classical
framework. This approach allows us to show that the transition from classical
to quantum formalism (for a spinless particle) does not require real
postulates, but rather soft generalizations.

concatenations of 1-bit and 2-bit elementary quantum gates.

the construction of elementary quantum gates. In this paper, we describe the
physical properties of these devices, and show the mathematical derivations
based on the interaction of the laser field as control with atoms, ions or
electron spins, leading to the following: (i) the 1-bit unitary rotation gates;
and (ii) the 2-bit quantum phase gates and the controlled-not gate. This paper

Ubiquitous structure on arcminute and degree scales in the polarized intensity
and polarization angle, combined with no observed structure in total intensity,
indicates that the structure in the polarized radiation must be due to Faraday
rotation and depolarization mostly in the warm nearby Galactic interstellar
medium (ISM). Beam depolarization most likely creates ""depolarization canals""
of one beam wide, while depth depolarization is responsible for creating most
of the structure on scales larger than a beam width. Rotation measures RM are
in the range -17 < RM < 10 rad/m2 with a non-zero average of about -3.4 rad/m2.
The gradient and average RM are consistent with a regular magnetic field of
about 1 uG which has a pitch angle of p = -14 degrees. 13 Extragalactic sources
in the field have |RM| < 13 rad/m2, with an estimated intrinsic source
contribution of 3.6 rad/m2. The RMs of the extragalactic sources show a
gradient (with a sign reversal) that is about 3 times larger than the gradient
in the RMs of the diffuse emission, and that is approximately in Galactic
latitude. This difference is ascribed to a vastly different effective length of
the line of sight. The observations are interpreted in terms of a
single-cell-size model of the warm ISM which contains gas and magnetic fields,
with a polarized background.

time are presented, based on average VLT FORS1 and FORS2 zero points. These

reliable membership determination of dEs can be obtained down to very faint
magnitudes -10<M_V<-12 mag (25 mag / arcsec^2) within integration times of the

method for the different simulated observing conditions we derive some simple
rules to calculate integration time and seeing needed to reach a determined
limiting magnitude at a given distance modulus for observing conditions
different to the ones adopted in the simulations. Our simulations show a small
offset of the order of 0.15 mag towards measuring too faint SBF. It is shown
that this is due to loss of fluctuation signal when recovering pixel-to-pixel
fluctuations from a seeing convolved image. To check whether our simulations
represent well the behaviour of real data, SBF measurements for a real and

our simulations are in good agreement with the achievable S/N of SBF

The ability of SDE to reproduce analytical solutions of the

of an increasing number of effects: shock acceleration, spatially dependent
diffusion coefficients and synchrotron losses. The SDEs prove to be efficient
in various shock configuration occurring in the inner jet during the

snapshots of strong single and multiple shock acceleration including realistic
spatial transport is treated. In chaotic magnetic diffusion regime, turbulence
levels $\eta_T=<\delta B^2>/(B^2+<\delta B^2>)$ around $0.2-0.3$ are found to
be the most efficient to enable particles to reach the highest energies. The

does not exhibit a power-law shape due to transverse momentum dependent
escapes. Out of this range, the confinement is not so efficient and the

sampling and the presence of a steep red power spectrum that can distort power
spectra measurement by causing severe power ``leakage''. We develop a simple
windowing method for computing red noise power spectra of uniformly sampled
data sets and test it on Monte Carlo generated sample realizations of red
power-law noise. We generalize time-domain methods of generating power-law red
noise with even integer spectral indices to the case of noninteger spectral
indices. The Jodrell Bank pulse phase residuals are dense and smooth enough
that an interpolation onto a uniform time series is possible. A windowed power
spectrum is computed revealing a periodic or nearly periodic component with a
period of about 568 days and a 1/f^3 power-law noise component with a noise
strength of 1.24 +/- 0.067 10^{-16} cycles^2/sec^2 over the analysis frequency
range 0.003 - 0.1 cycles/day. This result deviates from past analyses which
characterized the pulse phase timing residuals as either 1/f^4 power-law noise
or a quasiperiodic process. The analysis was checked using the Deeter
polynomial method of power spectrum estimation that was developed for the case
of nonuniform sampling, but has lower spectral resolution. The timing noise is
consistent with a torque noise spectrum rising with analysis frequency as f
implying blue torque noise, a result not predicted by current models of pulsar

models. Spatial fluctuations in the decay rate of the inflaton field to
ordinary matter lead to fluctuations in the reheating temperature. We argue
that in most realistic models of inflation the coupling of the inflaton to
normal matter is determined by the vacuum expectation values of fields in the
theory. If those fields are light during inflation (this is a generic situation
in the minimal models of supersymmetric inflation) they will fluctuate leading
to density perturbations through the proposed mechanism. We show that these
fluctuations could easily dominate over the ones generated through the standard
mechanism. The new scenario has several consequences for inflation model
building and observations. The proposed mechanism allows to generate the
observed level of density perturbations with a much lower scale of inflation
and thus generically predicts a smaller level of gravitational waves. The
relation between the slope of the spectrum of the produced density
perturbations and the potential of the inflaton field is different from the
standard relations obtained in the context of slow roll inflation. Because the
field responsible for the fluctuations is not the inflaton, it can have
significantly larger self couplings and thus density perturbations could be
non-Gaussian. The non-Gaussianity can be large enough to be detectable by CMB

an acceleration on the Local Group of galaxies, which can be seen in the dipole

from clusters of galaxies at gamma-ray energies between 10 keV and 10 TeV due
to inverse-Compton (IC) emission, pion-decay and non-thermal bremsstrahlung
(NTB) from cosmic-ray(CR) ions and electrons accelerated at cosmic shock and
secondary e+- from inelastic p-p collisions. We identify two main emission
region, namely the core (also bright in thermal X-ray) and the outskirts region
where accretion shocks occur. IC emission from shock accelerated CR electrons
dominate the emission in the outer regions of galaxy clusters, provided that at
least a fraction of a percent of the shock ram pressure is converted into CR
electrons. A clear detection of this component and of its spatial distribution
will allow us direct probing of cosmic accretion shocks. In the cluster core,
gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV is dominated by pion-decay mechanism and, at
lower energies, by IC emission from secondary e+-. However, IC emission from
shock accelerated electrons projected onto the cluster core will not be
negligible. We emphasize the importance of separating these emission components
for a correct interpretation of the experimental data and outline a strategy
for that purpose. Failure in addressing this issue will produce unsound
estimates of the intra-cluster magnetic field strength and CR ion content.
According to our estimate future space borne and ground based gamma-ray
facilities should be able to measure the whole nonthermal spectrum both in the
cluster core and at its outskirts. The importance of such measurements in
advancing our understanding of non-thermal processes in the intra-cluster
medium is discussed.

is affected by the presence of magnetic activity. In the 2-colour diagram we
find no colour change across the ""M dwarf gap"" (which would be indicative of
dust formation). For Teff=2800--3150K, the colours of Praesepe and Pleiades

Praesepe sources cooler than 2500K agree with the dusty models, but Pleiades

formation does not begin until lower Teffs in sources with lower surface
gravities. We also identify unresolved binaries in both clusters, and estimate

growth (for purely ejectional flows), and exponential instabilities of both

inherent to swirling MHD flows per se and what is the degree of its dependence

Alfv\'en waves (AW), slow magnetosonic waves (SMW) and fast magnetosonic waves

which shows a charge ordering transition at a temperature $T_{CO}$ ~ 245K. The
noise measurements were made using an ac bias with and without a dc bias
current imposed on it. We find that the spectral power $S_V(f)$ contains two
components - one broad band 1/f part that exists for all frequency and
temperature ranges and a single frequency Lorentzian of frequency $f_c$ which
is strongly temperature dependent. The Lorentzian in $S_V(f)$ which appears due
to Random telegraphic noise (RTN) as seen in the time series of the
fluctuation, is seen in a very narrow temperature window around $T_{CO}$ where
it makes the dominating contribution to the fluctuation. When the applied dc
bias is increased beyond a certain threshold current density $J_{th}$, the
electrical conduction becomes non-linear and one sees appearance of a
significant Lorentzian contribution in the spectral power due to RTN. We
explain the appearance of the RTN as due to coexisting Charge ordered (CO) and
reverse orbitally ordered (ROO) phases which are in dynamical equilibrium over
a mesoscopic length scale ($\approx 30nm$) and the kinetics being controlled by
an activation barrier $E_{a} ~ 0.45eV. The 1/f noise is low for $T>>T_{CO}$ but
increases by nearly two orders in a narrow temperature range as $T_{CO}$ is
approached from above and the probability distribution function (PDF) deviates
strongly from a Gaussian. We explain this behavior as due to approach of charge
localization with correlated fluctuators which make the PDF non-Gaussian.

However, the new modified methodology does not, in general, lead to a tree but
a graph, or several graphs that need not be inter-connected. The asset tree,
due to the minimum spanning tree criterion, is forced to ``accept'' edge
lengths that are far less optimal (longer) than the asset graph, thus resulting
in higher overall length for the tree. The same criterion also causes asset
trees to be more fragile in structure when measured by the single-step survival
ratio. Over longer time periods, in the beginning the asset graph decays more
slowly than the asset tree, but in the long-run the situation is reversed. The
vertex degree distributions indicate that the possible scale free behavior of

electrons in a two-dimensional square lattice interacting near the
saddle-points of the band, when the correlations at momentum ${\bf Q} = (\pi,
\pi)$ prevail in the system. The detailed consideration of the spin degrees of
freedom allows to discern the way in which the SU(2) spin invariance is
preserved in the renormalization process. Regarding the spin correlations, we
find two different universality classes which correspond, in the context of the
extended Hubbard model, to having the bare on-site interaction $U$ repulsive or
attractive. The first class is characterized by a spin instability which
develops through the condensation of particle-hole pairs with momentum ${\bf
Q}$, with the disappearance of the Fermi line in the neighborhood of the
saddle-points. Within that class, the attractive or repulsive character of the
nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ dictates whether there is or not a d-wave
superconducting instability in the system. For the Hubbard model with just
on-site interaction, we show that some of the irrelevant operators are able to
trigger the superconducting instability. The naturalness of the competing
instabilities is guaranteed by the existence of a range of doping levels in
which the chemical potential of the open system is renormalized to the level of
the saddle-points. We incorporate this effect to obtain the phase diagram as a
function of the bare chemical potential, which displays a point of optimal
doping separating the regions of superconductivity and spin instability.

where agents attempt to use some (possibly fictitious) causal correlations

correlation is estimated using the past history itself, and is used by a
fraction of agents to devise active trading strategies. The impact of these
strategies on the price modify the observed correlations. A potentially
unstable feedback loop appears and destabilizes the market from an efficient
behaviour. For large enough feedbacks, we find a `phase transition' beyond
which non trivial correlations spontaneously set in and where the market
switches between two long lived states, that we call conventions. This
mechanism leads to overreaction and excess volatility, which may be
considerable in the convention phase. A particularly relevant case is when the
source of information is the price itself. The two conventions then correspond
then to either a trend following regime or to a contrarian (mean reverting)
regime. We provide some empirical evidence for the existence of these
conventions in real markets, that can last for several decades.

From ${\bf {\bar F}}_t$, one may construct the passive electromagnetic field

the cosmic expansion. But since quantum-mechanical states should be unaffected
by the expansion, this classic calculation is hardly relevant for
quantum-mechanical systems such as atoms, so there is no reason to think that
the cosmic expansion should apply to them. Finally, it is shown that the main

with the mean field approximation employed, we show that the confined phase
must be accompanied by the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry for both
fundamental and adjoint quarks. Then we proceed to numerical analysis to look
into the coupled dynamics of the Polyakov loop and the chiral order parameter.
In the case of fundamental quarks, the pseudo-critical temperature inferred
from the Polyakov loop behavior turns out to coincide with the pseudo-critical
temperature of the chiral phase transition. We discuss the physical implication
of the coincidence of the pseudo-critical temperatures in two extreme cases;
one is the deconfinement dominance and the other is the chiral dominance. As
for adjoint quarks, the deconfinement transition of first order persists and
the chiral phase transition occurs distinctly at higher temperature than the
deconfinement transition does. The present model study gives us a plausible
picture to understand the results from the lattice QCD and aQCD simulations.

Kharkov conference. He starts by giving a comprehensive account of the
beginnings of quantum theory, emphasising that particle-like properties arise
as a consequence of treating wave-motions quantum-mechanically. He then goes on
to his recent discovery of quantization of ``wave fields'' and problems of
gauge invariance. The most surprising aspect of Jordan's presentation is
however his strong belief that his field quantization is a transitory not yet
optimal formulation of the principles underlying causal, local quantum physics.
The expectation of a future more radical change coming from the main architect
of field quantization already shortly after his discovery is certainly quite
startling. I try to answer the question to what extent Jordan's 1929
expectations have been vindicated. The larger part of the present essay
consists in arguing that Jordan's plea for a formulation without ``classical
correspondence crutches'', i.e. for an intrinsic approach (which avoids
classical fields altogether), is successfully addressed in past and recent
publications on local quantum physics.

Chemical rockets require a very large weight of propellant, travel very slowly
compared to light speed, and require significant energy to maintain operation
over periods of years. For example, the 722 kg Voyager spacecraft required
13,600 kg of propellant to launch and would take about 80,000 years to reach
the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, about 4.3 light years away. There have been
various attempts at developing ideas on which one might base a spacecraft that
would permit deep space travel, such as spacewarps. In this paper we consider
another suggestion from science fiction and explore how the quantum vacuum
might be utilized in the creation of a novel spacecraft. The spacecraft is
based on the dynamic Casimir effect, in which electromagnetic radiation is
emitted when an uncharged mirror is properly accelerated in the vacuum. The
radiative reaction produces a dissipative force on the mirror that tends to
resist the acceleration of the mirror. This force can be used to accelerate a
spacecraft attached to the mirror. We also show that, in principal, one could
obtain the power to operate the accelerated mirror in such a spacecraft using
energy extracted from the quantum vacuum using the standard Casimir effect
witha parallel plate geometry. Unfortunately the method as currently conceived
generates a miniscule thrust, and is no more practical than a spacewarp, yet it
does provide an interesting demonstration of our current understanding of the
physics of the quantized electromagnetic field in vacuum.

quantum information theory. We propose a new application of this resource to
the theory of quantum measurements. According to Naimark's theorem any rank 1
generalised measurement (POVM) M may be represented as a von Neumann
measurement in an extended (tensor product) space of the system plus ancilla.
By considering a suitable average of the entanglements of these measurement
directions and minimising over all Naimark extensions, we define a notion of
entanglement cost E_min(M) of M.
  We give a constructive means of characterising all Naimark extensions of a
given POVM. We identify various classes of POVMs with zero and non-zero cost
and explicitly characterise all POVMs in 2 dimensions having zero cost. We
prove a constant upper bound on the entanglement cost of any POVM in any
dimension. Hence the asymptotic entanglement cost (i.e. the large n limit of
the cost of n applications of M, divided by n) is zero for all POVMs.
  The trine measurement is defined by three rank 1 elements, with directions
symmetrically placed around a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We give an
analytic expression for its entanglement cost. Defining a normalised cost of
any d-dimensional POVM by E_min(M)/log(d), we show (using a combination of
analytic and numerical techniques) that the trine measurement is more costly
than any other POVM with d>2, or with d=2 and ancilla dimension 2. This
strongly suggests that the trine measurement is the most costly of all POVMs.

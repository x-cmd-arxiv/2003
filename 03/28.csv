nine young stellar objects and 12 RGB candidates. We have used the most recent
$\rm K_{0}-[15]$ relation by Jeong et al. (2002) based on recent theoretical
modeling of dust formation of AGB stars to determine mass-loss rates. However,
the uncertainties in the mass-loss rates are rather large. The mass-loss rates
of the supergiants are comparable with those in the solar neighbourhood while
the long-period Variables cover a mass-loss range from $\rm -5 < log

mass-loss rate range between $\rm -6.5 < log \dot{{\it{M}}} < -9$. We used the
equivalent width of the CO bandhead at 2.3 $\rm \mu m$, the NaI doublet and the
CaI triplet to estimate metallicities using the relation by Ram\'{\i}rez et al.
(\cite{Ramirez2000}). The metallicity distribution of the ISOGAL objects shows
a mean [Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.25 dex with a dispersion of $\rm \pm 0.40 dex$ which is
in agreement with the values of Ram\'{i}rez et al. (\cite{Ramirez2000}) for

comparison with the solar neighbourhood sample of Lan\c{c}on & Wood (LW) shows

however, forming a nuclear ring. Here we suggest that bars in the early

central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are created by gas that is driven deep
into the centers of galaxies by bars in the early stages of disk formation. The
coincidence of the QSO epoch with galaxy formation, the short lifetimes of
QSOs, and the existence of SMBHs in the centers of most bright galaxies are all
naturally accounted for by disk dynamics in this model. The progenitor SMBHs
are the seeds for brighter QSO flares during galaxy mergers. We present a new
study of bar weakening by central mass concentrations, which shows that bars
are less easily destroyed than previously thought. An extremely massive and
compact central mass can, however, dissolve the bar, which creates a

element abundance ratios, to model the Ca4227 absorption line indices of
early-type galaxies (Trager et al.), and to derive calcium element abundances.
We find that calcium, although being an alpha-element, is depressed with
respect to the other alpha-elements by up to a factor 2. This confirms
quantitatively earlier speculations that early-type galaxies are calcium
underabundant. We find a clear correlation between alpha/Ca ratio and central
velocity dispersion, which implies that more massive galaxies are more calcium
underabundant. Interestingly this correlation extends down to the dwarf
spheroidal galaxies of the Local Group for which alpha/Ca ratios have been
measured from high-resolution spectroscopy of individual stars (Shetrone et
al.). The increase of the calcium underabundance with galaxy mass balances the
higher total metallicities of more massive galaxies, so that calcium abundance
in early-type galaxies is fairly constant and in particular does not increase
with increasing galaxy mass. This result may be the key to understand why the
CaII triplet absorption of early-type galaxies at 8600 A is constant to within
5 per cent over a large range of velocity dispersions (Saglia et al.; Cenarro
et al.). The origin of the calcium underabundance in early-type galaxies
remains yet to be understood. We argue that formation timescales are
disfavoured to produce calcium underabundance, and that the option of
metallicity dependent supernova yields may be the most promising track to
follow.

continuous monitoring of its early optical afterglow decay, as well as
high-quality optical spectra that determined a redshift of z3=2.328 for its

several absorption lines. Spectral observations show multiple absorbers at
z3A=2.323, z3B= 2.317, and z3C= 2.293 blueshifted by 450, 990, and 3,155 km/s
respectively relative to the host galaxy Lyman-alpha emission. We argue that
these correspond to a fragmented shell nebula that has been radiatively
accelerated by the gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow at a distance greater than
0.3 pc from a Wolf-Rayet star progenitor. The chemical abundance ratios
indicate that the nebula is overabundant in carbon and silicon. The high level
of carbon and silicon is consistent with a swept-up shell nebula gradually
enriched by a WCL progenitor wind over the lifetime of the nebula prior to the
GRB onset. The detection of statistically significant fluctuations and color
changes about the jet-like optical decay further supports this interpretation
since fluctuations must be present at some level due to inhomogeneities in a
clumpy stellar wind medium or if the progenitor has undergone massive ejection
prior to the GRB onset. This evidence suggests that the mass-loss process in a
Wolf-Rayet star might lead naturally to an iron-core collapse with sufficient
angular momentum that could serve as a suitable GRB progenitor.

spectra are correlated with Seyfert type in the sense that steeper nuclear SEDs
(nu*f_nu increasing with increasing wavelength) tend to be found in Seyfert 2s
and flatter SEDs (nu *f_nu constant) in Seyfert 1-1.5s. The galaxies optically
classified as Seyferts 1.8s and 1.9s display values of alpha_IR as in type 1
objects, or values intermediate between those of Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s. The
intermediate SEDs of many Seyfert 1.8-1.9s may be consistent with the presence
of a pure Seyfert 1 viewed through a moderate amount (A_V <5mag) of foreground
galaxy extinction. We find, however, that between 10 and 20% of galaxies with
broad optical line components have steep infrared SEDs.
  Torus models usually adopt high equatorial opacities to reproduce the
infrared properties of Seyfert 1s and 2s, resulting in a dichotomy of infrared
SEDs (flat for type 1s, and steep for type 2s). Such a dichotomy, however, is
not observed in our sample. The wide range of spectral indices observed in the

objects with intermediate spectral indices cannot be reconciled with
predictions from existing optically thick torus models. We discuss possible
modifications to improve torus models, including low optical depth tori, clumpy
dusty tori, and high-optical-depth tori with an extended optically thin

that jets should be moving at about 0.23c with a jet kinetic energy of ~5 x
10^{50} erg, a similar energy scale to the GRB jets. The weak radio emission
from SN 2002ap has been used to argue against the jet hypothesis, but we show
that this problem can be avoided. However, the jet cannot be kept ionized
because of adiabatic cooling without external photoionization or heating
source. We found that only the radioactivity of 56Ni is a possible source,
indicating that the jet is formed and ejected from central region of the core
collapse. Then we point out that the jet will eventually sweep up enough
interstellar medium and generate shocks in a few to 10 years, producing strong
radio emission that can be spatially resolved, giving us a clear test for the
jet hypothesis. Discussions are given on possible implications for the GRB-SN
connection in the case that the jet is real. We suggest existence of two
distinct classes of GRBs from similar core-collapse events but by completely
different mechanisms. Cosmologically distant GRBs (~10^{50} erg) are collimated
jets generated by central activity of core collapses. SN 2002ap could be a
failed GRB of this type with a large baryon load. On the other hand, much less
energetic ones like GRB 980425 are rather isotropic, which may be produced by
hydrodynamical shock acceleration at the outer envelope. We propose that the
radioactive ionization for the SN 2002ap jet may give a new explanation also

optical and X-ray objects with redshifts ranging from 0.111 to 1.086. They all
show emission lines. The three with the highest redshifts are clearly QSOs. The
others with lower redshifts may either be QSOs or compact emission-line
galaxies. In addition to these six there are nine QSOs lying very close to M82
which were discovered many years ago. There is no difference between optical
spectra of these latter QSOs, only two of which are known to be X-ray sources,
and the X-ray emitting QSOs. The redshifts of all fifteen range between 0.111
and 2.05. The large number of QSOs and their apparent association with ejected
matter from M82 suggest that they are physically associated with the galaxy,
and have large intrinsic redshift components. If this is correct, the absolute
magnitudes lie in the range -8 < M_v < -10. Also we speculate that the luminous
variable X-ray source which has been detected by Chandra in the main body of
M82 some 9 arcseconds from the center is another QSO in the process of ejection
from the nucleus, and propose some observational tests of this hypothesis.

antiferromagnetic, charge and orbitally ordered (AFCOO) manganites. At very low
temperatures, the virgin magnetization curves of some of these compounds
exhibit several, sharp steps giving rise to a staircase-like shape. This
staircase effect is shown to be sensitive to various experimental parameters.
Several potential interpretations of the staircase effect are discussed in
relation to this set of results. A martensitic-like scenario, involving a
leading role of the structural distortions associated to the collapse of the
orbital ordering, is found to be the most plausible interpretation.

to a N=2 extended supersymmetry of composite operators of spinon and holons,
corresponding to the effective ""hadronic"" degrees of freedom. In this work we
elaborate further on this idea by describing in some detail the dynamics of a
specific composite model corresponding to an Abelian Higgs model (SQED). The
abelian nature of the gauge group seems to be necessitated both by the
composite structure used, but also by electric charge considerations for the
various composites. We demonstrate the passage from a pseudogap to an
unconventional superconducting phase, which notably is an exact
non-perturbative analytic result, due to the underlying N=2 supersymmetric
Abelian gauge theory. We believe that these considerations may provide a first
step towards a non-perturbative understanding of the phase diagrams of
strongly-correlated electron systems.

we examine this phenomenon from the point of view of the holographic dual

gravity side is shown to be precisely dual to the ""boundary operator product
expansion"" of operators as they approach the defect. From the field theory
point of view, the condition for localization is that a ""reduced operator""
appearing in this expansion acquires negative anomalous dimension. In
particular, a very light localized graviton exists when a mode arising from the
reduction of the ambient stress-energy tensor to the defect has conformal
dimension Delta ~ d-1. The part of the stress tensor containing the defect
dynamics has dimension Delta = d-1 in the free theory, but we argue that it
acquires an anomalous dimension in the interacting theory, and hence does not
participate in localization in the regime of small backreaction of the brane.
We demonstrate that such an anomalous dimension is consistent with the
conservation of the full stress-energy tensor. Finally, we analyze how to
compute the anomalous dimensions of reduced operators from gravity at leading
order in the interactions with the brane.

factors on the complex momentum-squared plane is exploited to continue
analytically the ultraviolet asymptotic form calculable by perturbation theory
into the infrared non-perturbative solution. We require the non-perturbative
multiplicative renormalizability to write down the renormalization group
equation. These requirements enable one to settle the value of the exponent
characterizing the infrared asymptotic solution with power behavior which was
originally predicted by Gribov and has recently been found as approximate
solutions of the coupled truncated Schwinger--Dyson equations. For this
purpose, we have obtained all the possible superconvergence relations for the
propagators and form factors in both the generalized Lorentz gauge and the
modified Maximal Abelian gauge. We show that the transverse gluon propagators
are suppressed in the infrared region to be of the massive type irrespective of
the gauge parameter, in agreement with the recent result of numerical
simulations on a lattice. However, this method alone is not sufficient to
specify some of the ghost propagators which play the crucial role in color
confinement. Combining the above result with the renormalization group equation
again, we find an infrared enhanced asymptotic solution for the ghost
propagator. The coupled solutions fulfill the color confinement criterion due
to Kugo and Ojima and also Nishijima, at least, in the Lorentz--Landau gauge.
We also point out that the solution in compatible with color confinement leads
to the existence of the infrared fixed point in pure Yang--Mills theory without
dynamical quarks. Finally, the Maximal Abelian gauge is also examined in
connection with quark confinement.

discuss how one can use this complexity measure to study what can and cannot be
achieved by formal axiomatic mathematical theories. In particular, I'll show
(a) that there are natural information-theoretic constraints on formal
axiomatic theories, and that program-size complexity provides an alternative
path to incompleteness from the one originally used by Kurt Godel. Furthermore,
I'll show (b) that in pure mathematics there are mathematical facts that are

determining the successive binary digits of the precise numerical value of the

believe that these meta-theorems (a,b) showing (a) that the complexity of
axiomatic theories can be characterized information-theoretically and (b) that
God plays dice in pure mathematics, both strongly suggest a quasi-empirical
view of mathematics. I.e., math is different from physics, but perhaps not as
different as people usually think. I'll also discuss the convergence of
theoretical computer science with theoretical physics, Leibniz's ideas on

232-Th, and nat-Pb following the absorption of photons with energies from 68
MeV to 3.77 GeV using the RELDIS Monte-Carlo code. This code implements the
cascade-evaporation-fission model of intermediate-energy photonuclear
reactions. It includes multiparticle production in photoreactions on
intranuclear nucleons, pre-equilibrium emission, and the statistical decay of
excited residual nuclei via competition of evaporation, fission, and
multifragmentation processes. The calculations show that in the GeV energy
region the fission process is not solely responsible for the entire total
photoabsorption cross section, even for the actinides: ~55-70% for 232-Th,
\~70-80% for 238-U, and ~80-95% for 233-U, 235-U, and 237-Np. This is because
certain residual nuclei that are created by deep photospallation at GeV photon
energies have relatively low fission probabilities. Using the recent
experimental data on photofission cross sections for 237-Np and 233,235,238-U
from the Saskatchewan and Jefferson Laboratories and our calculated fission
probabilities, we infer the total photoabsorption cross sections for these four
nuclei. The resulting cross sections per nucleon agree in shape and in
magnitude with each other. However, disagreement in magnitude with
total-photoabsorption cross-section data from previous measurements for nuclei
from C to Pb calls into question the concept of a ``Universal Curve'' for the
photoabsorption cross section per nucleon for all nuclei.

the transition form factors. The model provides an unified description of the
photo- and electroproduction data and of the vector meson and dilepton decays
of the nucleon resonances. The constraints on the transition form factors from
the quark counting rules are taken into account explicitly. The remaining
parameters of the model are fixed by fitting the available photo- and
electroproduction data and using results of the multichannel partial-wave
analysis of the $\pi N$ scattering. The results are used to describe dilepton
spectra measured at BEVALAC in proton-proton collisions.

  Synchrotron Radiation","60 pages, 39 figures",,,"DESY 03-31","physics.acc-ph",,"  In this paper we discuss a method for nondestructive measurements of the
longitudinal profile of sub-picosecond electron bunches for X-Ray Free Electron
Lasers (XFELs). The method is based on the detection of the Coherent
Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) spectrum produced by a bunch passing a dipole
magnet system. This work also contains a systematic treatment of synchrotron
radiation theory which lies at the basis of CSR. Standard theory of synchrotron
radiation uses several approximations whose applicability limits are often
forgotten: here we present a systematic discussion about these assumptions.
Properties of coherent synchrotron radiation from an electron moving along an
arc of a circle are then derived and discussed. We describe also an effective
and practical diagnostic technique based on the utilization of an
electromagnetic undulator to record the energy of the coherent radiation pulse
into the central cone. This measurement must be repeated many times with
different undulator resonant frequencies in order to reconstruct the modulus of
the bunch form-factor. The retrieval of the bunch profile function from these
data is performed by means of deconvolution techniques: for the present work we
take advantage of a constrained deconvolution method. We illustrate with
numerical examples the potential of the proposed method for electron beam
diagnostics at the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) accelerator. Here we choose, for
emphasis, experiments aimed at the measure of the strongly non-Gaussian
electron bunch profile in the TTF femtosecond-mode operation. We demonstrate
that a tandem combination of a picosecond streak camera and a CSR spectrometer
can be used to extract shape information from electron bunches with a narrow
leading peak and a long tail.

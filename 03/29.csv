LWDM model in which the mass of the dark matter particles is taken to be m_X=10
keV. The linear power spectrum for the LWDM model has a characteristic cut-off
at a wavenumber k=200 /Mpc, suppressing the formation of low mass (< 10^6 Msun)
nonlinear objects early on. The absence of low mass halos in the WDM model
makes the formation of primordial gas clouds with molecular hydrogen very
inefficient at high redshifts. The first star-forming gas clouds form at z~21
in the WDM model, considerably later than in the CDM counterpart, and the
abundance of these gas clouds differs by an order of magnitude between the two
models. We carry out radiative transfer calculations by embedding massive
Population III stars in the gas clouds. We show that the volume fraction of
ionized gas rises up close to 100% by z=18 in the CDM case, whereas that of the
WDM model remains extremely small at a level of a few percent. Thus the WDM
model with m_X=10 keV is strongly inconsistent with the observed high optical
depth by the WMAP satellite.

Effects of spatial transport within a homogeneous scattering cloud are also
included within the formalism. The Kompaneets equation that we solve includes
both the recoil and energy diffusion terms, and therefore our solution for the
Green's function approaches the Wien spectrum at large times. We show that the
Green's function can be used to generate all of the previously known
steady-state and time-dependent solutions to the Kompaneets equation. The new
solution allows the direct determination of the spectrum, without the need to
numerically solve the partial differential equation. Based upon the Green's

resulting from the reprocessing of an optically thin bremsstrahlung initial
spectrum with a low-energy cutoff. The new bremsstrahlung solution possesses a
finite photon number density, and therefore it displays proper equilibration to
a Wien spectrum at large times. The relevance of our results for the
interpretation of emission from variable X-ray sources is discussed, with
particular attention to the production of hard X-ray time lags, and the Compton

a presence of the second planet in this system. The preliminary
double-Keplerian orbital fit to the observations, announced by the discovery
team, describes a highly unstable, self-disrupting configuration. Because the
observational window of the HD 160691 system is narrow, the orbital parameters
of the hypothetical second companion are unconstrained. In this paper we try to
find out whether a second giant planet can exist up to the distance of Jupiter
and search for the dynamical constraints on its orbital parameters. Our
analysis employs a combination of fitting algorithms and simultaneous
examination of the dynamical stability of the obtained orbital fits. It reveals
that if the semi-major axis of the second planet is smaller than $\simeq 5.2$
AU, the observations are consistent with quasi-periodic, regular motions of the
system confined to the islands of various low-order mean motion resonances,
e.g., 3:1, 7:2, 4:1, 5:1, or to their vicinity. In such cases the second planet
has smaller eccentricity $\simeq 0.2-0.5$ than estimated in the previous works.
We show that the currently available Doppler data rather preclude the 2:1 mean
motion resonance expected by some authors to be present in the HD 160691

in this paper, which is a combination of the genetic minimization algorithm and
the MEGNO analysis, can be efficiently used for predicting stable planetary
configurations when only a limited number of observations is given or the data
do not provide tight constraints on the orbital elements.

late-type stars. The open cluster and Mt. Wilson star observations suggest that
rotating stars lie primarily on two sequences, initially called I and C. Some
stars lie in the intervening gap. These sequences, and the fractional numbers
of stars on each sequence evolve systematically with cluster age, enabling us
to construct crude rotational isochrones allowing `stellar gyrochronology', a
procedure, upon improvement, likely to yield ages for individual field stars.
The age and color dependences of the sequences allow the identification of the
underlying mechanism, which appears to be primarily magnetic. The majority of
solar- and late-type stars possess a dominant Sun-like, or Interface magnetic
field, which connects the convective envelope both to the radiative interior of
the star and to the exterior where winds can drain off angular momentum. These
stars spin down Skumanich-style. An age-decreasing fraction of young G, K, and
M stars, which are rapid rotators, possess only a Convective field which is not
only inefficient in depleting angular momentum, but also incapable of coupling
the surface convection zone to the inner radiative zone, so that only the outer
zone is spun down, and on an exponential timescale. These stars do not yet
possess large-scale dynamos. The large-scale magnetic field associated with the
dynamo, apparently created by the shear between the decoupled radiative and
convective zones, (re)couples the convective and radiative zones and drives a
star from the Convective to the Interface sequence through the gap on a
timescale that increases as stellar mass decreases. (Abstract is truncated

completion of cosmological reionization at z~6, on the other hand, are capable
of producing large HII regions around them (Stromgren spheres) to allow their
intrinsic Lyman-alpha emission lines to be transmitted without overwhelming
absorption (Cen & Haiman 2000). We suggest that targeted observations at the
Stromgren spheres of known luminous quasars at z >= 6 would be able to detect
Lyman-alpha emission lines of galaxies inside the Stromgren spheres largely
unattenuated. A tunable, very narrowband filter of \Delta\lambda\over \lambda ~
0.1% or a narrowband filter of \Delta\lambda\over \lambda ~1% with follow-up
spectroscopic identifications will be required. Such observations could
directly observe the sources of cosmological reionization including possibly
the Pop III galaxies at z=6-20 by JWST. Possible applications include
determinations of the ionization state of the intergalactic medium, the sizes
of the Stromgren spheres, the ages of the quasars, the luminosity function of
high redshift galaxies and its evolution, the spatial distribution of galaxies

all six were fit with a density power-law index of 2.0; however, in half of the

1.5 can be rejected at the 95% confidence level. Further, we modeled the
systems using the pure Larson-Penston (LP) and Shu solutions with only age and
sound speed as parameters. Overall, the LP solution provides a better fit to
the data, both in likelihood and providing the observed luminosity, but the age
of the systems required by the fits are surprising low (1000-2000 yrs). We
suggest that either there is some overall time scaling of the self-similar

the stage where models need to incorporate more of the fundamental physics of

well described by the ionization energy based Fermi-Dirac statistics. However,
these transport models are not appropriate for cuprates below the
characteristics ($T^*$) and critical temperatures ($T_c$), metals with free
electrons and strong electron-phonon scattering. Ionization energy is found to
be an essential parameter to accurately predict variations of resistivity's
magnitude with doping, charge carriers' concentrations, scattering rate
constants as well as the effective mass. Apart from that, iFDS based
resistivity models provide the comprehensive information on
crossover-temperature (metallic $\to$ insulating transition temperature) in the
normal state of high-$T_c$ superconductors.

neutron diffraction, Daoud-Aladine et al.[PRL89,97205(2002)] have proposed a
new ground state structure for the half-doped manganites R0.5Ca0.5MnO3, where R
is a trivalent ion like Bi,La,Pr,Sm or Y. Their proposal describes the CE
magnetic structure attributed to these materials as an arrangement of dimers
along the ferromagnetic Mn zig-zag chains that form it. However, the dimers'
proposal is in conflict with the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson rules, which give
a coherent description of many transition metal insulating compounds and
predict the coexistence of Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions in equal parts in the half-doped
manganites. On the other hand, Rivadulla et al.[PRB 66, 174432 (2002)] have
studied several single crystal samples of half-doped manganites and propose a
phase diagram in terms of the tolerance factor which contains both types of
structures. In the present work we have calculated the magnon dispersion
relations for the CE magnetic structure, arising for each type of proposal: the
charge ordered and the dimer phases, respectively. We consider a
three-dimensional unit cell containing 16 spins, and compare the magnetic
excitations along different paths in the first Brillouin zone. We conclude that
measurement of the magnon dispersion relations should allow a clear distinction
between the two proposals, predicting qualitative differences arising along
specific directions of propagation in the first Brillouin zone.

symmetry breaking scale f is several TeV, where we have kept the normalization
of f constant in the different models. For example, the ``minimal''
implementation of SU(6)/Sp(6) is bounded by f>3.0 TeV throughout most of the

theory, which is equipped with a mass parameter mu. An early such study in flat
spacetime (mu=0) served to sharpen intuition about D-brane interactions,
showing in particular the key role of the ``stringy halo'' that surrounds a
D-brane. The halo marks the edge of the region within which tachyon
condensation occurs, opening a gateway to new non-trivial vacua of the theory.
It seems pertinent to study the fate of the halo for non--zero mu. We focus on
the simplest cases of a Lorentzian brane with p=1 and an Euclidean brane with
p=-1, the D--instanton. For the Lorentzian brane, we observe that the halo is
unaffected by the presence of non--zero mu. This most likely extends to other
(Lorentzian) p. For the Euclidean brane, we find that the halo is affected by
non-zero mu. As this is related to subtleties in defining the exchange
amplitude between Euclidean branes in the open string sector, we expect this to
extend to all Euclidean branes in this background.

all remaining holes have side 2, and the holes are distributed symmetrically

to the difference between the number of down-pointing and up-pointing unit

These spin models were subsequently generalized to so-called 4-weight spin
models by Bannai and Bannai; these could be used to construct partition
functions, but did not lead to braid group representations in any obvious way.
Jaeger showed that spin models were intimately related to certain association
schemes. Yamada gave a construction of a symmetric spin model on $4n$ vertices

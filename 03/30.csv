focus of a meter class telescope. Between 70 GHz and 300 GHz, where foreground
contamination is minimum, it is extremely important to reach the best trade-off
between the improvement of the angular resolution and the minimization of the
straylight contamination mainly due to the Galactic emission. We focus here, as
a working case, on the 30 and 100 GHz channels of the Planck Low Frequency
Instrument (LFI). We evaluate the GSC introduced by the most relevant Galactic
foreground components for a reference set of optical configurations. We show
that it is possible to improve the angular resolution of 5-7% by keeping the
overall GSC below the level of few microKelvin. A comparison between the level
of straylight introduced by the different Galactic components for different
beam regions is presented. Simple approximate relations giving the rms and
peak-to-peak levels of the GSC are provided. We compare the results obtained at
100 GHz with those at 30 GHz, where GSC is more critical. Finally, we compare
the results based on Galactic foreground templates derived from radio and IR
surveys with those based on WMAP maps including CMB and extragalactic source
fluctuations.

refine our partition of phase space until we reach a set of states which
predict their own future, i.e. which are Markovian. Macrostates arrived at in

may appear in the low energy neutrinos emitted in triton decay, with maximum
neutrino energy of 18.6 KeV. The technical challenges to this end can be
summarized as building a very large TPC capable of detecting low energy
recoils, down to a few 100 eV, within the required low background constraints.
More specifically We propose the development of a spherical gaseous TPC of
about 10-m in radius and a 200 Mcurie triton source in the center of curvature.
One can list a number of exciting studies, concerning fundamental physics
issues, that could be made using a large volume TPC and low energy
antineutrinos:1) The oscillation length involving the small mixing angle in the
electronic neutrino disappearancei experiment is comparable to the length of
the detector. Measuring the counting rate of neutrino-electron elastic
scattering will give a precise measurement of the oscillation parameters free
of systematic errors. First estimations show that a sensitivity of a few
percent for the measurement of the above angle. 2) The low energy detection
threshold offers a unique sensitivity for the neutrino magnetic moment which is
about two orders of magnitude beyond the current experimental limit. 3)
Scattering at such low neutrino energies has never been studied and any
departure from the expected behavior may be an indication of new physics beyond
the standard model. We present results of theoretical calculation and studies
of possible measurements.

of nature should be invariant or covariant under a general coordinate
transformation. In general relativity, the equivalence principle tells us the
existence of a local inertial coordinate system and the fundamental laws in the
local inertial coordinate system which are the same as those in inertial
reference system. Then, after a general coordinate transformation, the
fundamental laws of nature in arbitrary coordinate system or in arbitrary
curved space-time can be obtained. However, through a simple example, we find
that, under a general coordinate transformation, basic physical equations in
general relativity do not transform covariantly, especially they do not
preserve their forms under the transformation from a local inertial coordinate
system to a curved space-time. The origination of the violation of the general
covariance is then studied, and a general theory on general coordinate
transformations is developed. Because of the the existence of the
non-homogeneous term, the fundamental laws of nature in arbitrary curved
space-time can not be expressed by space-time metric, physical observable and
their derivatives. In other words, basic physical equations obtained from the
equivalence principle and the principle of general covariance are different
from those in general relativity. Both the equivalence principle and the
principle of general covariance can not be treated as foundations of general
relativity. So, what are the foundations of General Relativity? Such kind of
essential problems on General Relativity can be avoided in the physical picture
of gravity. Quantum gauge theory of gravity, which is founded in the physics
picture of gravity, does not have such kind of fundamental problems.

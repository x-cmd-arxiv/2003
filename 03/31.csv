Ly-alpha absorption spectra, we investigate the non-Gaussian features of the
transmitted flux fluctuations, and their effect upon the power spectrum of this
field. We find that the spatial distribution of the local power of the
transmitted flux on scales k >= 0.05 s/km is highly spiky or intermittent. The
probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the local power are long-tailed.
The power on small scales is dominated by small probability events, and
consequently, the uncertainty in the power spectrum of the transmitted flux
field is generally large. This uncertainty arises due to the slow convergence
of an intermittent field to a Gaussian limit required by the central limit
theorem (CLT). To reduce this uncertainty, it is common to estimate the error
of the power spectrum by selecting subsamples with an ""optimal"" size. We show
that this conventional method actually does not calculate the variance of the
original intermittent field but of a Gaussian field. Based on the analysis of
intermittency, we propose an algorithm to calculate the error. It is based on a
bootstrap re-sampling among all independent local power modes. This estimation
doesn't require any extra parameter like the size of the subsamples, and is
sensitive to the intermittency of the fields. This method effectively reduces
the uncertainty in the power spectrum when the number of independent modes
matches the condition of the CLT convergence.

optical emission from the reverse shock drops below that from the forward shock
within 100s of seconds of the burst. The typical frequency $\nu_m$ of the
synchrotron emission from the forward shock passes through the optical band
typically on a timescale of minutes to hours. Before the passage of $\nu_m$,
the optical flux evolves as $t^{-1/4}$ and after the passage, the decay
steepens to $t^{-(3p-2)/4}$, where $p$ is the exponent for the assumed
power-law energy distribution of nonthermal electrons and is typically $\sim
2$. The steepening in the slope of temporal decay should be readily
identifiable in the early afterglow light curves. We propose that such a
steepening was observed in the R-band light curve of GRB 021004 around day 0.1.
Available data at several radio frequencies are consistent with this
interpretation, as are the X-ray observations around day~1. The early evolution

distribution of solids is governed by many processes: gas-solid coupling,
coagulation, sedimentation, evaporation/condensation, so that the distribution
of planetesimals emerging from a turbulent disk does not necessarily reflect
that of gas. In order to describe this evolution we use a method developed in
Stepinski and Valageas which, using a series of simplifying assumptions, is
able to simultaneously follow the evolution of gas and solid particles for up
to $10^7 {\rm yr}$. Then, the distribution of planetesimals obtained after
$10^7 {\rm yr}$ is used to study the migration rate of a giant planet through
the migration model introduced in \cite{DP1}. This allows us to investigate the
dependence of the migration rate on the disk mass, on its time evolution and on
the value of the dimensionless viscosity parameter alpha. We find that in the
case of disks having a total mass of $10^{-3}-10^{-1} M_{\odot}$, and
$10^{-4}<\alpha<10^{-1}$, planets can migrate inward over a large distance
while if $M_{\rm d}<10^{-3} M_{\odot}$ the planets remain almost at their
initial position for $\alpha>10^{-3}$ and only in the case $\alpha<10^{-3}$ the
planets move to a minimum value of orbital radius of $\simeq 2 {\rm AU}$.
Moreover, the observed distribution of planets in the period range 0-20 days

component for the rms quadrupole normalisation Qrms and primordial spectral
index n and find results in excellent agreement with those derived from the

Gorski et al.(1996) in which the galactic emission has been taken into account

evaluate the extent of foreground contamination in the COBE-DMR data. We
include an all-sky Halpha survey (Dickinson, Davies & Davis 2003) to determine
a reliable free-free template. In particular we find that, after subtraction of
the thermal dust emission predicted by the Finkbeiner, Davis & Schlegel (1999)

indicates the presence of an anomalous dust correlated component which is well

cases are considered: the chain is connected to electrodes and in the other
case the chain is confined giving zero dc conduction. The concentration of
charge is varied using a gate electrode. At low temperatures and with the
presence of an injection barrier, the mobility is an oscillatory function of
density. This is due to the phenomenon of charge density pinning. Mobility
changes occur due to the co-operative pinning and unpinning of the
distribution. At high temperatures, we find that the electron-electron
interaction reduces the mobility monotonically with density, but perhaps not as
much as one might intuitively expect because the path summation favour the
in-phase contributions to the mobility, i.e. the sequential paths in which the
carriers have to wait for the one in front to exit and so on. The carrier
interactions produce a frequency dependent mobility which is of the same order
as the change in the dc mobility with density, i.e. it is a comparably weak
effect. However, when combined with an injection barrier or intrinsic disorder,
the interactions reduce the free volume and amplify disorder by making it
non-local and this can explain the too early onset of frequency dependence in
the conductivity of some high mobility quasi-one-dimensional organic materials.

given by Bouchaud and Dean, is valid for a general class of mean-field trap
models: it relies only on the way a perturbation affects the transition rates,
but is independent of the distribution of trap depths and the form of the
unperturbed transition rates, and holds for all observables that are
uncorrelated with the energy. The model with Glauber dynamics and an
exponential distribution of trap depths, as considered by Barrat and Mezard,
does not fall into this class if the perturbation is introduced in the standard
way by shifting all trap energies. I show that a similar relation between

at low temperatures. The results point to intriguing parallels between trap
models with energetic and entropic barriers.

superfunctions on $T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal M}_{cl}\times \{\theta\}$ being
associated with these systems are studied. Various types of antibrackets and
differential operators acting on $C^{k}\bigl(T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal M}_{cl} \times
\{\theta\} \bigr)$ are considered. Component (on $\theta$)formulation for GSTF
quantities and operations is produced. Analogy between ordinary Hamiltonian
classical mechanics and GSTF in Hamiltonian formulation is proposed.
Realization of the GSTF general scheme is demonstrated on 6 models.

which are locally finitely generated over a discrete valuation ring $V$ of
mixed characteristic. Typically, we can only conclude that a particular
Conjecture holds for such a ring provided the residual characteristic of $V$ is
sufficiently large in terms of the complexity of the data, where the complexity
is primarily given in terms of the degrees of the polynomials over $V$ that
define the data, but possibly also by some additional invariants such as
(homological) multiplicity. Thus asymptotic versions of the Improved New
Intersection Theorem, the Monomial Conjecture, the Direct Summand Conjecture,
the Hochster-Roberts Theorem and the Vanishing of Maps of Tors Conjecture are
given.
  That the results only hold asymptotically, is due to the fact that
non-standard arguments are used, relying on the Ax-Kochen-Ershov Principle, to
infer their validity from their positive characteristic counterparts. A key
role in this transfer is played by the Hochster-Huneke canonical construction
of big Cohen-Macaulay algebras in positive characteristic via absolute integral

fixed free group $F_k$ has strongly linear time generic-case complexity. This
is done by showing that the ``hard'' part of the algorithm terminates in linear
time on an exponentially generic set of input pairs. We then apply these
results to one-relator groups. We obtain a Mostow-type isomorphism rigidity
result for random one-relator groups: If two such groups are isomorphic then
their Cayley graphs on the \emph{given generating sets} are isometric. Although
no nontrivial examples were previously known, we prove that one-relator groups
are generically \emph{complete} groups, that is, they have trivial center and
trivial outer automorphism group. We also prove that the stabilizers of generic
elements of $F_k$ in $Aut(F_k)$ are cyclic groups generated by inner
automorphisms and that $Aut(F_k)$-orbits are uniformly small in the sense of
their growth entropy. We further prove that the number $I_k(n)$ of
\emph{isomorphism types} of $k$-generator one-relator groups with defining
relators of length $n$ satisfies \[ \frac{c_1}{n} (2k-1)^n \le I_k(n)\le
\frac{c_2}{n} (2k-1)^n, \] where $c_1=c_1(k)>0, c_2=c_2(k)>0$ are some
constants independent of $n$. Thus $I_k(n)$ grows in essentially the same

scales observed both by WMAP and COBE DMR appears to be lower than the one
predicted by the standard model of cosmology with almost scale free primordial
perturbations arising from a period of inflation
\cite{cobe,Bennett:2003bz,Spergel,Peiris}. One can either interpret this as a
manifestation of cosmic variance or as a physical effect that requires an
explanation. We discuss various mechanisms that could be responsible for the
suppression of such low $\ell$ multipoles. Features in the late time evolution
of metric fluctuations may do this via the integral Sachs-Wolfe effect. Another
possibility is a suppression of power at large scales in the primordial
spectrum induced by a fast rolling stage in the evolution of the inflaton field
at the beginning of the last 65 e-folds of inflation. We illustrate this effect
in a simple model of inflation and fit the resulting CMB spectrum to the
observed temperature-temperature (TT) power spectrum. We find that the WMAP
observations suggest a cutoff at $k_c=4.9^{+1.3}_{-1.6}\times
10^{-4}$Mpc$^{-1}$ at 68% confidence, while only an upper limit of $k_c <
7.4\times 10^{-4}$Mpc$^{-1}$ at 95%. Thus, although it improves the fit of the
data, the presence of a cutoff in power spectrum is only required at a level
close to $2\sigma$. This is obtained with a prior which corresponds to equal
distribution wrt $k_c$. We discuss how other choices (such as an equal
distribution wrt $\ln k_c$ which is natural in the context of inflation) can
affect the statistical interpretation.

the V773 Tau pre-main sequence triple system, a weak-line T Tauri (WTTS) system
in which the presence of an evolved, ``fossil'' protoplanetary disk has been
inferred on the basis of a significant infrared excess. Our images reveal a
fourth object bound to the system, V773 Tau D. While it is much fainter than
all other components at 2 micron, it is the brightest source in the system at
4.7 micron. We also present medium-resolution K band adaptive optics
spectroscopy of this object, which is featureless with the exception of a weak
Br gamma emission line. Based on this spectrum and on the spectral energy
distribution of the system, we show that V773 Tau D is another member of the
small class of ``infrared companions'' (IRCs) to T Tauri stars. It is the least
luminous, and probably the least massive, component of the system, as opposed
to most other IRCs, which suggests that numerous low-luminosity IRCs such as
V773 Tau D may still remain to be discovered. Furthermore, it is the source of
the strong IR excess in the system. We therefore reject the interpretation of
this excess as the signature of a fossil (or ``passive'') disk and further
suggest that these systems may be much less frequent than previously thought.
  We further show that V773 Tau C is a variable classical T Tauri star (CTTS)
and that its motion provides a well constrained orbital model. We show that
V773 Tau D can be dynamically stable within this quadruple system if its orbit
is highly inclined. Finally, V773 Tau is the first multiple system to display
such a variety of evolutionary states (WTTS, CTTS, IRC), which may be the
consequence of the strong star-star interactions in this compact quadruple

detection of a QPO in the X-ray flux from an extra-Galactic ULX, and confirms
that the source is a compact object. Based on the QPO strength and previous
Chandra observations it appears likely that the QPO is associated with the most
luminous object in the central region of M82, CXOM82 J095550.2+694047, however,
XMM imaging alone is not sufficient to unambiguously confirm this. The other
plausible candidate is CXOM82 J095551.1+694045, however, the QPO luminosity is
comparable to the peak luminosity of this object in Chandra observations, which
argues against it being the source of the QPO. The QPO had a centroid frequency
of 54.3 +- 0.9 mHz, a coherence of 5, and an amplitude (rms) in the 2 - 10 keV
band of 8.5%. Below 0.2 Hz the power spectrum can be described by a power-law

curving continuum, with a disk-blackbody (diskbb) at T = 3.1 keV providing an
acceptable fit. A broad Fe line centered at 6.55 keV is required in all fits,

which employs the synthetic spectra of Vazdekis et al. 2003, provide a means to
address the template-mismatch problem, and are shown to provide as good or
better fits as traditional stellar templates. We anticipate the technique to be
of particular use for high-redshift galaxy kinematics. We give the measurement
of a recently defined CaT* index Cenarro et al. 2001a, and describe the global
properties of the bulge kinematics as derived from the kinematic profiles. We
detect small-amplitude minor-axis rotation, generally due to inner isophotal
twists as a result of slightly triaxial bulges or misaligned inner disks; such
inner features do not show peculiar colors or distinct CaT* index values.
Velocity dispersion profiles, which extend well into the disk region, show a
wide range of slopes. Flattened bulges tend to have shallower velocity
dispersion profiles. The inferred similarity of bulge and disk radial velocity
dispersions supports the interpretation of these bulges as thickened disks.

the pairwise velocity dispersion, a, and the real-space correlation function,
xi(r), for galaxies with both relatively low star-formation rates (for which
the present rate of star formation is less than 10% of its past averaged value)
and galaxies with higher current star-formation activity. At small separations,
the real-space clustering of passive galaxies is very much stronger than that
of the more actively star-forming galaxies; the correlation-function slopes are
respectively 1.93 and 1.50, and the relative bias between the two classes is a
declining function of radius. On scales larger than 10 h^-1 Mpc there is
evidence that the relative bias tends to a constant, b(passive)/b(active) ~ 1.
This result is consistent with the similar degrees of redshift-space
distortions seen in the correlation functions of the two classes -- the
contours of xi(sigma,pi) require beta(active)=0.49+/-0.13, and
beta(passive)=0.48+/-0.14. The pairwise velocity dispersion is highly
correlated with beta. However, despite this a significant difference is seen
between the two classes. Over the range 8-20 h^-1 Mpc, the pairwise velocity
dispersion has mean values 416+/-76 km/s and 612+/-92 km/s for the active and
passive galaxy samples respectively. This is consistent with the expectation
from morphological segregation, in which passively evolving galaxies
preferentially inhabit the cores of high-mass virialised regions.

processes operating in the planet; b) the dynamical contribution associated
with excitation of modes of oscillation. These contributions are obtained
self-consistently from a single set of the governing equations. We calculate a
critical 'equilibrium' value of angular velocity of the planet \Omega_{crit}
determined by the condition that action of the dynamical tides does not alter
the angular velocity at that rotation rate. We show that this can be much
larger than the corresponding rate associated with quasi-static tides and that
at this angular velocity, the rate of energy exchange is minimised. We also
investigate the conditions for the stochastic increase in oscillation energy
that may occur if many periastron passages are considered. We make some simple
estimates of time scale of circularization of initially eccentric orbit due to
tides, using a realistic model of the planet, for orbits withperiods after
circularization typical of those observed for extra-solar planets P_{obs} >
3days. We find that dynamic tides could have produced a very large decrease of
the semi-major axis of a planet with mass of the order of the Jupiter mass

discuss several unresolved issues in the context of the scenario of the orbit

groups and clusters up to about two virial radii, while passive objects show a
preference to reside closer to the halo centre. If we assume a broken power-law

the velocity dispersion $\sigma$ of host galaxies, we develop a theoretical
model of black hole formation in galactic bulges (this paper generalizes an
earlier ApJ Letter). The model assumes an initial state specified by a a
uniform rotation rate $\Omega$ and a density distribution of the form $\rho =
\aeff^2 / 2 \pi G r^2$ (so that $\aeff$ is an effective transport speed). The
black hole mass is determined when the centrifugal radius of the collapse flow
exceeds the capture radius of the central black hole (for Schwarzschild
geometry). This model reproduces the observed correlation between the estimated
black hole masses and the velocity dispersions of galactic bulges, i.e., $\mbh
\approx 10^8 M_\odot (\sigma/200 {\rm km s^{-1}})^4$, where $\sigma = \sqrt{2}
\aeff$. To obtain this normalization, the rotation rate $\Omega \approx 2
\times 10^{15}$ rad/s. The model also defines a bulge mass scale $M_B$. If we
identify the scale $M_B$ with the bulge mass, the model determines the ratio
$\mrat$ of black hole mass to the host mass: $\mrat$ $\approx$ 0.0024

values. In this scenario, supermassive black holes form quickly (in $\sim10^5$

how these results depend on the assumed initial conditions; the most important
quantity is the initial distribution of specific angular momentum in the

Gaussian initial conditions without driving; each one at two different

operating such that 5% of the total mass in the box has been accretted into

very different values of the BE fits. Finally, we briefly discuss recent

most galaxies today to have undergone a QSO phase in their youth. The current

spectral residuals at different radii of the cluster and iii) reprojecting the
unfolded profiles and comparing them directly to the measured quantities. Our

is presented. Gas density and temperature profiles are calculated for the inner
500 h_{50}^{-1} kpc (~0.35 r_200). The outer regions of the surface brightness
profile are well described with a beta model with beta=0.74, but the central
regions require the introduction of a second component. The temperature profile
is flat at the exterior with a slight dip towards the centre. The total mass
profile, calculated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, is consistent with an NFW
profile, but with a low concentration parameter c=3.75 +/- 0.74. The M/L_B
ratio profile shows that, at large scale, light traces mass to a reasonable
extent, and the M/L_B ratio at 0.35 r_200 is consistent with the trends with
mass observed in the optical. The M_Fe/L_B ratio is about two times less than
that observed for a cluster at 5 keV. The gas mass fraction rises rapidly to
level off at ~200 kpc; the value at 0.35 r_200 is ~8%. The scaling properties
of the emission measure profile are consistent with the empirical relation
\mgas \propto \Tx^{1.94}, and not with the self-similar relation \mgas \propto
\Tx^{1.5}. Comparison of the entropy profile of A1983 with that of the hot
cluster A1413 shows that the profiles are well scaled using the empirically
determined relation S \propto \Tx^{0.65}, suggesting that the slope of the S-T
relation is shallower than in the self-similar model. The form of the entropy
profiles is remarkably similar, and there is no sign of a larger isentropic
core in the cooler cluster. These data provide powerful agruments against
preheating models. In turn, there is now increasing observational support for a
trend of f_gas with system mass, which may go some way towards explaining the
observed scaling behaviour. (Abridged.)

beaming. More quantitatively, deriving the beaming Doppler factor of a given

the protons produced in neutron decays is expected. This associated proton
signal also leads to an excess in the direction of the spiral arm. For
realistic models of the regular and random galactic magnetic fields, the
resulting anisotropy as a function of the energy is obtained. We find that for
the anisotropy to become sufficiently suppressed below E\sim 10^{17.9}eV, a
significant random magnetic field component is required, while on the other
hand, this also tends to increase the angular spread of the associated proton
signal and to reduce the excess in the spiral arm direction. The source
luminosity required in order that the right ascension anisotropy be 4% for the
AGASA angular exposure corresponds to a prediction for the point-like flux from
direct neutrons compatible with the flux detected by SUGAR. We also analyse the
distinguishing features predicted for a large statistics southern observatory.

distinguish between two qualitatively different contributions to the DCF: One
which preserves rotational invariance, and one which breaks it and vanishes in
the isotropic phase. We find that the symmetry preserving contribution is
barely affected by the phase transition. However, symmetry breaking
contributions emerge in the nematic phase and may become quite substantial.
Thus the DCF in a nematic fluid is not rotationally invariant. In the isotropic
fluid, the DCF is in good agreement with the prediction of the Percus-Yevick

polyamines such as spermine and spermidine. In experiments, the aggregation
occurs above a certain threshold concentration of multivalent ions. We
demonstrate that the dependence of this threshold on the concentration of DNA
has a simple form. When the DNA concentration c_DNA is smaller than the
monovalent salt concentration, the threshold multivalent ion concentration
depends linearly on c_DNA, having the form alpha c_DNA + beta. The coefficients
alpha and beta are related to the density profile of multivalent counterions
around isolated DNA chains, at the onset of their aggregation. This analysis
agrees extremely well with recent detailed measurements on DNA aggregation in
the presence of spermine. From the fit to the experimental data, the number of
condensed multivalent counterions per DNA chain can be deduced. A few other
conclusions can then be reached: i) the number of condensed spermine ions at
the onset of aggregation decreases with the addition of monovalent salt; ii)
the Poisson-Boltzmann theory over-estimates the number of condensed multivalent
ions at high monovalent salt concentrations; iii) our analysis of the data
indicates that the DNA charge is not over-compensated by spermine at the onset
of aggregation.

few millimetres, the value of magnetic Jc is in agreement with the transport Jc

obtaining Jc for small bulk MgB2. The increase of Hirr with the sample size is
an artefact of defining Hirr by the value of Jc at which an additional
superconducting screening on 1mm scale dominates Dm.

when in one layer the carrier is in the zero (n=0) Landau level while in the
other layer - in the first (n=1) Landau level the dependence of the energy of
the pair on its momentum E(P} is found. This dependence turns out to be
nonmonotonic one : a local maximum and a local minimum appears, indicating the
emergence of a metastable bound state of two carrier with the same sign of

on the boundary ``brane universe'' and its geometry is that of an
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model. The effective action
governing the model in the mini-superspace approximation is derived. We find
that the presence of black hole horizons in the bulk gives rise to a complex
action for certain classically allowed brane configurations, but that the
imaginary contribution plays no role in the equations of motion. Classical and
instanton brane trajectories are examined in general and for special cases, and
we find a subset of configuration space that is not allowed at the classical or
semi-classical level; these correspond to spacelike branes carrying tachyonic
matter. The Hamiltonization and Dirac quantization of the model is then
performed for the general case; the latter involves the manipulation of the
Hamiltonian constraint before it is transformed into an operator that
annihilates physical state vectors. The ensuing covariant Wheeler-DeWitt
equation is examined at the semi-classical level, and we consider the possible
localization of the brane universe's wavefunction away from the cosmological
singularity. This is easier to achieve for branes with low density and/or

discrepancy has been elicited. Indeed, theory and experiment dissent by one per
cent, and though this fact could be a consequence of the mounting of the
experimental device, it might also embody a difference between the way in which
gravity behaves in classical and quantum mechanics. In this work the effects,
upon the interference pattern, of space--time torsion will be analyzed heeding
its coupling with the spin of the neutron beam. It will be proved that, even
with this contribution, there is enough leeway for a further discussion of the
validity of the equivalence principle in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.

which are defined within the orthonormal frame formalism, and leads to the
formulation of Einstein's field equations with a perfect fluid matter source as
an autonomous system of evolution equations and constraints. This framework
incorporates spatially homogeneous dynamics in a natural way as a special case,
thereby placing earlier work on spatially homogeneous cosmology in a broader
context, and allows us to draw on experience gained in that field using
dynamical systems methods. One of our goals is to provide a precise formulation
of the approach to the spacelike initial singularity in cosmological models,
described heuristically by Belinski\v{\i}, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz.
Specifically, we construct an invariant set which we conjecture forms the local
past attractor for the evolution equations. We anticipate that this new
formulation will provide the basis for proving rigorous theorems concerning the
asymptotic behavior of spatially inhomogeneous cosmological models.

the $\delta$-function-like phase factor. The requirement that this reduction
would respect natural physical properties (positivity, well-defined continuum

of the superpartners out of the spectrum induces potentially large
contributions to the Yukawa couplings of light quarks via those of the heavier
ones. These corrections can be sizeable even for moderate values of tan(beta),
and remain nonvanishing even if all superpartners decouple. When the SUSY
breaking scale is close to the electroweak scale, the Higgs exchange effects
can compete with the gauge boson and box diagram contributions to rare
processes, and their partial cancellations can lead to relaxation of the
existing bounds on flavor violation sources. In this case there exist sizeable
enhancements in flavor-changing Higgs decays. When the superpartners completely
decouple, however, the Higgs mediation becomes the dominant SUSY contribution
to rare processes the saturation of which, without a strong suppression of the
flavor mixings, prefers large tan(beta) and certain ranges for the CP-odd
phases. The decay rate of the lightest Higgs into light down quarks become
comparable with that into the bottom quark. Moreover, the Higgs decay into the
up quark is significantly enhanced. There are observable implications for rare

experiments is to study new phases of matter at extreme temperature and
density. It is expected that a nontrivial classical pion field configuration
can occasionally form during the out-of-equilibrium chiral phase transition. We
have recently shown that, contrarily to what has been assumed so far, this
configuration is not identical to the so-called disoriented chiral condensate
(DCC), proposed in the early 1990's. A detailed analysis reveals that a more
realistic picture is that of an ``unpolarized'' DCC, where the Fourier modes of
the field have completely independent orientations in isospin space instead of
being aligned with each other as in the original DCC. This has important
implications concerning the possible detection of the phenomenon. In
particular, the main expected signature of the original DCC, which is used in
most experimental searches, is absent in the unpolarized case. We point out
that the fact that no evidence of DCC formation has been reported so far in
nuclear collisions actually agrees with our present theoretical understanding.
New experimental strategies should be designed to look for the unpolarized DCC
in existing data from SPS as well as in future searches at RHIC and LHC.

single reduced transport parameter. Our formalism sheds light on cases where
neither the linearized analyis nor the kinematic theory of phase waves give an

gravitational in nature. These models also assume that the plasma densities and
charges on the grains are small enough that electromagnetic forces can be

succinct proof for a NP decision problem. Whereas all FNP problems can be
reduced to NP, there is no obvious reduction of FQMA to QMA since the solution

generalises known necessary and sufficient entropic conditions for quantum
error correction as well as the conditions for the achievability of the Holevo
bound on accessible information.

computation with atoms in optical cavities. The internal state of the atoms are
entangled by a measurement of the phase of light transmitted through the
cavity. By repeated measurements an entangled state is created with certainty,
and this entanglement can be used to implement gates on qubits which are stored
in different internal degrees of freedom of the atoms. This method, based on
measurement induced dynamics, has a higher fidelity than schemes making use of
controlled unitary dynamics.

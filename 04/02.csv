All Sky Survey. We minimize the possible contamination by stars, dust, seeing
and sky brightness by studying their cross correlation with galaxy density, and
limiting the galaxy sample accordingly. We measure the correlation function at
scales between 1-18 arcdegs using a half million galaxies. We find a best fit
power law to the correlation function has a slope of 0.76 and an amplitude of
0.11. However, there are statistically significant oscillations around this
power law. The largest oscillation occurs at about 0.8 degrees, corresponding
to 2.8 h^{-1} Mpc at the median redshift of our survey, as expected in halo
occupation distribution descriptions of galaxy clustering.
  We invert the angular correlation function using Singular Value Decomposition
to measure the three-dimensional power spectrum and find that it too is in good
agreement with previous measurements. A dip seen in the power spectrum at small
wavenumber k is statistically consistent with CDM-type power spectra. A fit of
CDM-type power spectra to k < 0.2 h Mpc^{-1} give constraints of
\Gamma_{eff}=0.116 and \sigma_8=0.96. This suggest a K_s-band linear bias of
1.1+/-0.2. This \Gamma_{eff} is different from the WMAP CMB derived value. On
small scales the power-law shape of our power spectrum is shallower than that
derived for the SDSS. These facts together imply a biasing of these different
galaxies that might be nonlinear, that might be either waveband or luminosity
dependent, and that might have a nonlocal origin.

for absorption features produced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
The presence of these molecules in the interstellar medium has been postulated
to explain the infrared emission features seen in the 3-13 $\mu$m spectra of
numerous sources. UV spectra are uniquely capable of identifying specific PAH
molecules. We obtained high S/N UV spectra of stars which are significantly
more reddened than those observed in previous studies. These data put limits on
the role of small (30-50 carbon atoms) PAHs in UV extinction and call for
further observations to probe the role of larger PAHs. PAHs are of importance
because of their ubiquity and high abundance inferred from the infrared data
and also because they may link the molecular and dust phases of the
interstellar medium. A presence or absence of ultraviolet absorption bands due
to PAHs could be a definitive test of this hypothesis. We should be able to
detect a 20 \AA wide feature down to a 3$\sigma$ limit of $\sim$0.02 A$_V$. No
such absorption features are seen other than the well-known 2175 \AA bump.

a model where the cores consist of very optically thick C18O clumps cannot

not very optically thick. The CO emission is compared to previous observations
of dust continuum emission to deduce apparent molecular abundances. The
abundance values depend somewhat on the temperature but relative to `normal
abundance' values, the CO appears to be depleted by about a factor of 10 at the
core positions. CO condensation on dust grains provides a natural explanation
for the apparent depletion both through gas-phase depletion of CO, and through
a possible increase in dust emissivity in the cores. The high brightness of
HCO+ relative to CO is then naturally accounted for by time-dependent
interstellar chemistry starting from `evolved' initial conditions. Theoretical
work has shown that condensation of H2O, which destroys HCO+, would allow the

explained by the higher mean redshift of this sample but must be intrinsic. Our
small sample contains five quasars with unusually red colors, including three
that appear very heavily reddened. Our data are fitted well with normal blue
quasar spectra attenuated by more than 2.5 magnitudes of extinction in the
I-band.
  The red quasars are only seen at low redshifts (z<1.3). Even with a magnitude
limit I<20.5, our survey is deep enough to detect only the most luminous of
these red quasars at z~1; similar objects at higher redshifts would fall below
our in I-band limit. Indeed, the five most luminous objects (using dereddened
magnitudes) with z<1.3 are all red. Our data strongly support the hypothesis
that radio quasars are dominated by a previously undetected population of red,
heavily obscured objects. Unless highly reddened quasars are preferentially
also highly luminous, there must be an even larger, as yet undiscovered,
population of red quasars at lower luminosity. We are likely to be finding only
the most luminous tip of the red quasar iceberg.
  Five of our six z<1 quasars are associated with Deeprange cluster candidates
of similar estimated redshifts. This association is very unlikely to be the
result of chance. It has some surprising implications, including the

45%. The mass to light ratio in our ensemble increases by a factor of ~2 over
the cluster mass range (10^{14}-10^{15}M_sun). We examine the total baryon
fraction, showing that it is an increasing function of cluster mass. Using the
mass to light ratio of massive clusters, we find that Omega_M=0.19+/-0.03;
using the total baryon fraction we find that Omega_M=0.28+/-0.03, in good

the cluster iron mass fraction. The stellar mass fraction decreases by a factor
of 1.8 from low to high mass clusters, and the ICM to stellar mass ratio
increases from 5.9 to 10.4 over the same mass range. Together, these
measurements suggest a decrease of star formation efficiency with increasing
cluster mass and provide constraints on models of the thermodynamic history of
the intracluster medium. The cluster iron mass to total mass ratio is constant

have taken place before the bulk of stars in cluster galaxies formed.

compare the amplitude and configuration dependence of the functions with
ray-tracing simulations and find excellent agreement for different scales and

measure than the convergence. In addition, the symmetry properties of the shear
three-point functions provide a new and precise way of disentangling the

properties of galaxy-group and cluster halos from lensing surveys. Shear
correlations on small scales arise from the lensing matter within halos of mass
M > 10^13 solar masses. Thus the measurement of two- and three-point
correlations can be used to extract information on halo density profiles,
primarily the inner slope and halo concentration. We demonstrate the
feasibility of such an analysis for forthcoming surveys. We include covariances
in the correlation functions due to sample variance and intrinsic ellipticity
noise to show that 10% accuracy on profile parameters is achievable with
surveys like the CFHT Legacy survey, and significantly better with future
surveys. Our statistical approach is complementary to the standard approach of
identifying individual objects in survey data and measuring their properties.

unresolved component with equivalent width of 40 eV and a broad component with
full width at half maximum of 40000 km/s and equivalent width of 120 eV. An

Alternatively, most of the flux in the broad component could also be modeled as
reflection emission which mimics emission line like feature due to the presence
of iron K-shell edge at 7.1eV, however, the reflection fraction is much higher
than that inferred from the BeppoSax observations. The disk inclination angle
of about 47 deg, inferred from the disk-line fits, and the absorption column of

photoelectric absorption, suggest that our line of sight passes through the
outer edge of a putative torus and are consistent with those expected for a

holes in dense star clusters. We focus on the early dynamical evolution of
young clusters containing a few thousand to a few million stars. One natural
formation path for a central seed black hole in these systems involves the
development of the Spitzer instability, through which the most massive stars
can drive the cluster to core collapse in a very short time. The sudden
increase in the core density then leads to a runaway collision process and the
formation of a very massive merger remnant, which must then collapse to a black
hole. Alternatively, if the most massive stars end their lives before core
collapse, a central cluster of stellar-mass black holes is formed. This cluster
will likely evaporate before reaching the highly relativistic state necessary
to drive a runaway merger process through gravitational radiation, thereby
avoiding the formation of a central massive black hole. We summarize the
conditions under which these different paths will be followed, and present the
results of recent numerical simulations demonstrating the process of rapid core
collapse and runaway collisions between massive stars.

dwarf (WD) stars appropriate for the study of massive ZZ Ceti stars. We follow
the complete evolution of massive WD progenitors from the zero-age main
sequence through the thermally pulsing and mass loss phases to the WD regime.
Abundance changes are accounted for by means of a full coupling between nuclear
evolution and time-dependent mixing due to diffusive overshoot, semiconvection
and salt fingers. In addition, time-dependent element diffusion for
multicomponent gases has been considered during the WD stage. We find that
before the ZZ Ceti stage is reached, element diffusion has strongly smoothed
out the chemical profile to such a degree that the resulting internal abundance
distribution does not depend on the occurrence of overshoot episodes during the
thermally pulsing phase. The mass of the hydrogen envelope left at the ZZ Ceti
domain amounts to $M_H \approx 2.3 \times 10^{-6}$ \msun. This is about half as
large as for the case when element diffusion is neglected. The implications of
our new models for the pulsational properties of massive ZZ Ceti stars are
discussed. In this regard, we find that the occurrence of core overshooting
during central helium burning leaves strong imprints on the theoretical period
spectrum of massive ZZ Ceti stars. Finally, we present a simple new
prescription for calculating the He/H profile which goes beyond the trace

stars form in DLAs, and that the FUV radiation they emit heats the gas by the
grain photoelectric mechanism. We infer the heating rate from the cooling rate
measured by the strength of CII* 1335.7 absorption. Since the heating rate is
proportional to the dust-to-gas ratio and the SFR per unit area, we deduce the
SFR per unit area for DLAs in which both quantities have been measured. We
consider models in which the the dust comprises carbonaceous or silicate
grains. We present two-phase models where the cold neutral medium (CNM) and
warm neutral medium (WNM) are in pressuer equilibrium. In the CNM model the the
sightline goes throught the CNM and WNM, while in the WNM model it goes only
through the WNM. Since the grain photoelectric heating efficiency is at least
10 times higher in the CNM than in the WNM, CII* absorption mainly arises in
the CNM in the CNM model. But in the WNM model all of the CII* absorption
arises in the WNM. We use CII* absorption lines to derive the SFR per unit area
for a sample of ~ 30 DLAs in which the dust-to-gas ratio has been inferred from
element depletion patterns. We show that the resulting SFR per unit area
corresponds to an average over the star forming volume of galaxy hosting the
DLA rather than to local star formation along the line of sight. We find the
average SFR per unit area and equals10$^{-2.2}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$

Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) throughout the entire Universe.
Observations of gravitational waves from this class of sources will have
important repercussions on our understanding of the behaviour of gravity in the
highly non-linear relativistic regime, the distribution and interaction of
massive black holes at high redshift and the formation and evolution of cosmic
structures. It is therefore important to address how accurately LISA can
measure the source parameters and explore the implications for astronomy and
cosmology. Present observations and theoretical models suggest that massive
black holes could be spinning, possibly rapidly in some cases. In binary
systems, the relativistic spin-orbit interaction causes the orbital plane to
precess in space producing a characteristic signature on the emitted
gravitational waves. In this paper we investigate the effect of spins on the
gravitational wave signal registered at the LISA output and the implications
for parameter estimation. We consider the in-spiral phase of binary systems in
circular orbit undergoing the so-called ""simple precession"" and we approximate
the gravitational radiation at the restricted 1.5PN order. We show that the
presence of spins changes dramatically the signature of the signal recorded by
LISA. As a consequence, the mean square errors associated to the parameter
measurements are significantly smaller than the ones obtained when the effect
of spins is neglected. For a binary system of two $10^6 \Ms$ black holes, the
angular resolution and the relative error on the luminosity distance improve by
a factor $\approx$ 3-to-10; the fractional errors on the chirp mass and the
reduced mass decrease by a factor $\sim 10$ and $\sim 10^3$, respectively.

galaxy. The X-ray-to-infrared luminosity ratio is consistent with this result.
Together with the X-ray data, XMM-Newton obtained UV images of NGC 1511,
tracing massive stars heating the ambient gas, which is then seen in H\alpha
emission. UV, H\alpha and near-infrared imagery suggest that NGC 1511 is
disturbed, most likely by its two small companions, NGC 1511a and NGC 1511b.

upper limit of 1.6% for the fraction of luminosity in a diffuse intragroup

in the scattering at the Curie temperature for wave vectors below ~0.065 A^-1.
Strong relaxation effects are observed for this domain scattering, for the

that the transition is not continuous in nature. There is a large oxygen
isotope effect observed for the T_C in the polycrystalline samples. For the

abrupt transition to the paramagnetic, insulating state. Application of
uniaxial stress in the x=0.3 single crystal sharply enhances the polaron

the Wightman function, the vacuum expectation values of the field square, the
vacuum energy density, radial and azimuthal stress components in the region

the generalized Abel-Plana formula for the series over zeros of combinations of
the cylinder functions. This formula allows us to extract from the vacuum
expectation values the parts due to a single sphere on background of the global
monopole gravitational field, and to present the ""interference"" parts in terms
of exponentially convergent integrals, useful, in particular, for numerical

of the self--action and interaction terms. The first one contains well known
surface divergences and needs a further regularization. The interaction forces
between the spheres are finite for all values $a<b$ and are attractive for a
Dirichlet scalar. The asymptotic behavior of the vacuum densities is

representations, that are local excitations of a reference one fulfilling Haag
duality, a symmetric tensor $\mathrm{C}^*$-category $\Bim$ of bimodules of the

introducing an equivalent formulation of the theory in terms of the presheaf

infinite, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of conjugates.

The Cuntz groupoid is not principal and the spectral theorem for bimodules does
not apply in full generality. We characterize the bimodules (over a natural
masa) which are determined by their spectra in the Cuntz groupoid; these are
exactly the ones which are invariant under the guage automorphisms and exactly
the ones which are generated by the Cuntz partial isometries which they

  We investigate analytic subalgebras of $O_n, n$ finite, by studying cocycles
on the Cuntz groupoid. In contrast to AF groupoids, there are no cocycles which
are integer valued or bounded and vanish precisely on the natural diagonal.
$O_n$ contains a canonical UHF subalgebra; each strongly maximal triangular
subalgebra of the UHF subalgebra has an extension to a strongly maximal
triangular subalgebra of $O_n$ and each trivially analytic subalgebra of the
UHF subalgebra has a proper analytic extension.

P11(1440), D13(1520) and S11(1535). During the last few years photoproduction
experiments have largely contributed to a better understanding of these states,
but the strong suppression of the resonance structure in total photoabsorption
experiments from nuclei is still not understood. The D13-resonance dominates
the resonance structure due to its large photon coupling. In this contribution
new results for the excitation and decay modes of the D13 on the free nucleon
and first results for the in-medium behavior of the resonance are summarised.

emphasis is laid on the production of neutral mesons which due to the

study of excited states of the nucleon. Experiments carried out during the last
ten years with the TAPS-detector at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI) have very

and the propagation to the on-shell mass induces a net shift and squeezing of

mapping from spike signals which are output from the neural processing system

locally in a reconstructed state space embodying both the dynamics of the
source of the sensory signal and the dynamics of the neural circuit doing the

neuron model and input from a low dimensional dynamical system, the Lorenz
system. We show that one may accurately learn the dynamical input/output
connection and estimate with high precision the details of the input signals
from spike timing output alone. This form of ""reading the neural code"" has a
focus on the neural circuitry as a dynamical system and emphasizes how one
interprets the dynamical degrees of freedom in the neural circuit as they
transform analog environmental information into spike trains.

for a wide range of interaction strengths and particle number, and compared to
pairing in nuclei. Especially systems, where the pairing gap exceeds the level
spacing but is smaller than the shell splitting $\hbar\omega$, are studied
which applies to most trapped Fermi atomic systems as well as to finite nuclei.
When solving the gap equation for a large trap with such multi-level pairing,
one finds that the matrix elements between nearby harmonic oscillator levels
and the quasi-particle energies lead to a double logarithm of the gap, and a
pronounced shell structure at magic numbers. It is argued that neutron and
proton pairing in nuclei belongs to the class of multi-level pairing, that
their shell structure follows naturally and that the gaps scale as $\sim
A^{-1/3}$ - all in qualitative agreement with odd-even staggering of nuclear
binding energies. Pairing in large systems are related to that in the bulk
limit. For large nuclei the neutron and proton superfluid gaps approach the
asymptotic value in infinite nuclear matter: $\Delta\simeq 1.1$ MeV.

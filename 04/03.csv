Fermi acceleration at relativistic shocks. The particle trajectories in tangled
magnetic fields are integrated out exactly from entry to exit through the
shock, and the conditional probability of return as a function of ingress and
egress pitch angles is constructed by Monte-Carlo iteration. These upstream and
downstream probability laws are then used in conjunction with the energy gain
formula at shock crossing to reproduce Fermi acceleration. For pure Kolmogorov
magnetic turbulence upstream and downstream, the spectral index is found to
evolve smoothly from s=2.09 +/- 0.02 for mildly relativistic shocks with
Lorentz factor Gamma=2 to s=2.26 +/- 0.04 in the ultra-relativistic limit Gamma
>> 1. The energy gain is ~Gamma^2 at first shock crossing, and ~2 in all
subsequent cycles as anticipated by Gallant & Achterberg (1999). The

Lac object PKS 2005-489. Previous multiwavelength monitoring campaigns of PKS
2005-489 have found complex variability behavior both in flux density and in
broadband spectrum, with different modes and timescales from days to hours.
During this campaign, PKS 2005-489 was observed to be in an unusual state,
bright in the optical but faint in the X-ray, just prior to an X-ray flare that
began on 2 September 2000. PKS 2005-489 was also observed to have a flatter
optical spectrum than prior epochs. A linear increase in optical flux density
was observed during the first 5.2 days of the campaign. However, intraday and
color variability were not detected. The large discrepancy between the ratio of
X-ray to optical flux density observed during this campaign and that observed
in prior epochs indicates a lack of long-term correlation between the two
wavebands; and it illustrates that simple particle injection events in the jet
are insufficient to explain the long-term variability behavior of this object.
Twenty-three in-field standard stars are identified for future optical
monitoring programs.

use of synthesis codes. The limit is defined by the following statement: The
total luminosity of the cluster modeled must be larger than the individual
contribution of any of the stars included in the assumed isochrones. This limit
is independent of the assumptions on the IMF and almost independent on the star
formation history. We have obtained the LLL for a wide range of ages (5 Myr to
20 Gyr) and metallicities (Z=0 to Z=0.019) from Girardi et al. (2002)
isochrones. Using the LLL and the results of evolutionary synthesis models we
have also obtained the minimal cluster mass, Mmin, for which the results of
synthesis models may suffer from a severe bias in the computation of colors. We
show that the results of synthesis models for clusters with mass equal to Mmin
have a relative dispersion about or larger than 32% (i.e. a dispersion of 0.35
mag) in the corresponding photometric bands. This effect is more important for
near infrared bands (except in the case where Asymptotic Giant Branch stars
dominate the luminosity in optical bands). In particular, Mmin takes values
between 10^4 and 10^5 Mo for the K band. From the observational point of view,
we show that in surveys that reach luminosities near the LLL, the color
distributions will be skewed toward the color with lower effective sources
(toward the red in general), and that the skewness is a signature of the
distribution of initial cluster masses in the survey. We also apply the LLL to
Globular Clusters showing that sampling effects are relevant in these clusters
and that they can explain (at least partially) the bias of the observed colors
with respect to the predictions of synthesis models.

total mass, age, and star-formation mode) may have very different stellar mass
spectra due to the incomplete sampling of the underlying mass function; such
differences are especially relevant in the high-mass tail due to the smaller
absolute number of massive stars. The dispersion in the number of massive stars
also produces a dispersion in the properties of the corresponding ionising
spectra. In this paper, we lay the bases for the future analysis of this effect
by evaluating the dispersion in the ionising fluxes of synthetic spectra. As an
important consequence, we found that the intensities of synthetic fluxes at
different ionisation edges are strongly correlated, a fact suggesting that no
additional dispersion will result from the inclusion of sampling effects in the
analysis of diagnostic diagrams; this is true for HII regions on all scales.
Additionally, we find convincing suggestions that the He II lines are strongly
affected by sampling, and so cannot be used to constrain the evolutionary
status of stellar clusters. We also establish the range of applicability of
synthesis models set by the Lowest Luminosity Limit for the ionising flux, that
is the lowest limit in cluster mass for which synthesis models can be applied
to predict ionising spectra. This limit marks the boundary between the
situations in which the ionising flux is better modeled with a single star as
opposed to a star cluster; this boundary depends on the metallicity and age,
ranging from 10^3 to more than 10^6 Mo. As a consequence, synthesis models
should not be used to try to account for the properties of clusters with
smaller masses.

narrow emission-line ratios requiring a Seyfert 2 classification. This weak

WR stars (Vink et al. \cite{Vink00}, \cite{Vink01}; Nugis & Lamers
\cite{NuLa00}) and of the wind anisotropies induced by rotation. We find that
the rotation velocities $v$ of WR stars are modest, i.e. about 50 km s$^{-1}$,
not very dependant on the initial $v$ and masses. For the most massive stars,
the evolution of $v$ is very strongly influenced by the values of the mass loss
rates; below $\sim$12 M$_\odot$ the evolution of rotation during the MS phase
and later phases is dominated by the internal coupling. Massive stars with
extreme rotation may skip the LBV phase.
  Models having a typical $v$ for the O--type stars have WR lifetimes on the
average two times longer than for non--rotating models. The increase of the WR
lifetimes is mainly due to that of the H--rich eWNL phase. Rotation allows a
transition WN/WC phase to be present for initial masses lower than 60
M$_\odot$. The durations of the other WR subphases are less affected by
rotation. The mass threshold for forming WR stars is lowered from 37 to 22
M$_\odot$ for typical rotation. The comparisons of the predicted number ratios
WR/O, WN/WC and of the number of transition WN/WC stars show very good
agreement with models with rotation, while this is not the case for models with
the present--day mass loss rates and no rotation. As to the chemical abundances
in WR stars, rotation brings only very small changes for WN stars, since they
have equilibrium CNO values. However, WC stars with rotation have on average
lower C/He and O/He ratios. The luminosity distribution of WC stars is also
influenced by rotation.

lambda_obs < 930nm, we could simultaneously determine photometric redshifts
with an accuracy of sigma_z<0.03 and obtain spectral energy distributions. The
redshift range covered by the sample is 1.2<z<4.8, which implies that even at
z~3, the sample reaches below luminosities corresponding to M_B = -23,
conventionally employed to distinguish between Seyfert galaxies and quasars. We
clearly detect a broad plateau-like maximum of quasar activity around z~2 and
map out the smooth turnover between z~1 and z~4. The shape of the LF is
characterised by some mild curvature, but no sharp `break' is present within
the range of luminosities covered. Using only the COMBO-17 data, the evolving
LF can be adequately described by either a pure density evolution (PDE) or a
pure luminosity evolution (PLE) model. However, the absence of a strong L*-like
feature in the shape of the LF inhibits a robust distinction between these
modes. We present a robust estimate for the integrated UV luminosity generation
by AGN as a function of redshift. We find that the LF continues to rise even at
the lowest luminosities probed by our survey, but that the slope is
sufficiently shallow that the contribution of low-luminosity AGN to the UV
luminosity density is negligible. Although our sample reaches much fainter flux
levels than previous data sets, our results on space densities and LF slopes
are completely consistent with extrapolations from recent major surveys such as
SDSS and 2QZ.

particular warping and/or precession of the accretion disk. Recent theoretical
work predicts the stability to disk warping of X-ray binaries as a function of
the mass ratio, binary radius, viscosity and accretion efficiency, and here we
examine the constraints that can be placed on such models by current
observations.
  In paper I we used a dynamic power spectrum (DPS) analysis of long-term X-ray
datasets (CGRO, RXTE), focusing on the remarkable, smooth variations in the
superorbital period exhibited by SMC X-1. Here we use a similar DPS analysis to
investigate the stability of the superorbital periodicities in the neutron star
X-ray binaries Cyg X-2, LMC X-4 and Her X-1, and thereby confront stability
predictions with observation. We find that the period and nature of
superorbital variations in these sources is consistent with the predictions of
warping theory.
  We also use a dynamic lightcurve analysis to examine the behaviour of Her X-1

significant phase shift some 15 cycles before the ALS, which indicates a change
in the disk structure or profile leading into the ALS.

reactions display non-equilibrium continuous transitions separating active from
inactive, absorbing states, where stochastic fluctuations cease entirely. Their
critical properties can be analyzed via a path-integral representation of the
corresponding classical master equation, and the dynamical renormalization
group. An overview over the ensuing universality classes in single-species
processes is given, and generalizations to reactions with multiple particle
species are discussed as well. The generic case is represented by the processes
A <-> A + A, and A -> 0, which map onto Reggeon field theory with the critical
exponents of directed percolation (DP). For branching and annihilating random
walks (BARW) A -> (m+1) A and A + A -> 0, the mean-field rate equation predicts
an active state only. Yet BARW with odd m display a DP transition for d <= 2.
For even offspring number m, the particle number parity is conserved locally.
Below d_c' = 4/3, this leads to the emergence of an inactive phase that is
characterized by the power laws of the pair annihilation process. The critical
exponents at the transition are those of the `parity-conserving' (PC)
universality class. For local processes without memory, competing pair or
triplet annihilation and fission reactions k A -> (k - l) A, k A -> (k+m)A with
k=2,3 appear to yield the only other universality classes not described by
mean-field theory. In these reactions, site occupation number restrictions play
a crucial role.

justified to describe complex systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion. Finally,
a notion of generalized thermodynamics emerges in the context of the the
violent relaxation of collisionless stellar systems and two-dimensional
vortices due to the existence of Casimir invariants and incomplete relaxation.
A thermodynamical analogy can also be developed to analyze the nonlinear
dynamical stability of stationary solutions of the Vlasov and 2D Euler-Poisson
systems. On general grounds, we suggest that generalized entropies arise due to
the existence of ``hidden constraints'' that modify the form of entropy that we
would naively expect. Generalized kinetic equations are therefore ``effective''

because of a zero energy state (ZES) at the interfaces. In the case of

overwhelmed by the energetic cost of opening a loop: mismatches are therefore
irrelevant (and molecular recognition of the strands is perfect). Generating
random mutations with probability $p$ on one strand, we find that large values

Green's functions does not predict an ordered magnetic ground state, while
Stoner's mean-field treatment, which is equivalent to the VCA on the Hubbard
model, does so for a wide range of parameters. A hybrid treatment, the tau-CPA,
is developed, in which a particle is assumed to be scattered from an array of
static opposite spins for a time tau related to the inverse of the band width.
The propagation is treated in the CPA over this period; thereafter the particle
sees the time-averaged effect of the scatterers and hence can be treated in the
VCA. This model, with suitable approximations, does predict magnetism for a
modified Stoner criterion.

inflationary, radiation dominated and matter dominated eras are investigated in
detail. In all three eras, the tachyonic pressure decreases with increasing
radius of the universe and is thus minimal in the matter dominated era. The
gravitational effects of the dust, however, may still strongly affect the
universe at present time. In case the tachyonic pressure is positive, it
enhances the overall matter {\em density} and is a candidate for dark matter.
In the case where the tachyonic pressure is negative, the recent acceleration
of the universe can be understood without the need for a cosmological constant.
The ordinary matter, however, has positive energy density at all times. In a
later section, the extension to a variable cosmological term is investigated
and a specific model is put forward such that recent acceleration and future
re-collapse is possible.

relate that angle to Berry's topological phase. Some particles admit both signs
of helicity, and it is then possible to define a reduced density matrix for
their polarization. However, that density matrix is physically meaningless,
because it has no transformation law under the Lorentz group, even under
ordinary rotations.

formulated in this way the effective theory of nuclear forces can be put on the
same firm theoretical grounds as the quantum mechanics of atomic phenomena. In
this case the effective theory allows one to describe with a given accuracy not
only two-nucleon scattering, but also the evolution of nucleon systems, and
places the constraints on the off-shell behavior of the two-nucleon
interaction. In this way we predict the off-shell behavior of the S wave
two-nucleon T-matrix at very low energies when the pionless theory is
applicable. Further extensions and applications of this approach are discussed.

which shows, circumventing known no-go theorems, that an objective
(noncontextual, hence local) interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM) is
possible. We consider here compound physical systems and show why the proofs of
nonlocality of QM do not hold within the SR model. We also discuss quantum
measurement theory within this model, note that the objectification problem
disappears since the measurement of any property simply reveals its unknown
value, and show that the projection postulate can be considered as an
approximate law, valid FAPP (for all practical purposes). Finally, we provide
an intuitive justification for some unusual features of the SR model.

$SL(2,\C)^{\times 4}$-covariants of a binary quadrilinear form. Interpreted in
terms of a four qubit system, this describes in particular the algebraic
varieties formed by the orbits of local filtering operations in its projective
Hilbert space. Also, this sheds some light on the local unitary invariants, and
provides all the possible building blocks for the construction of entanglement
measures for such a system.

only local operation and classical communication (LOCC) are allowed. We prove
that we cannot distinguish the states of an unextendible product basis (UPB) by
LOCC even when infinite resources (infinite-dimensional ancillas, infinite
number of operations). Moreover we give a necessary and sufficient condition
for the LOCC distinguishability of complete product bases.

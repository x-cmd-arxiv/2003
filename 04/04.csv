  Astronomy","New Astron. 10 (2004) 113-120","10.1016/j.newast.2004.06.003",,"astro-ph",,"  We show that the explosion of the first supernovae can trigger low-mass star
formation via gravitational fragmentation of the supernova-driven gas shell. If
the shell mass does not exceed the host galaxy gas mass, all explosions with
energies E_SN > 10^{51} erg can lead to shell fragmentation. However, the
minimum ambient density required to induce such fragmentation is much larger,
n_0 > 300 cm^{-3}, for Type II supernovae than for pair-instability ones, which
can induce star formation even at lower ambient densities. The typical mass of
the unstable fragments is 10^{4-7} Msun; their density is in the range
110-6x10^7 cm{-3}. Fragments have a metallicity strictly lower than 10^{-2.6}
Zsun and large values of the gravitational-to-pressure force ratio f ~ 8. Based
on these findings, we conclude that the second generation of stars produced by
such self-propagating star formation is predominantly constituted by low-mass,
long-living, extremely metal-poor (or even metal-free, if mixing is suppressed)
stars. We discuss the implications of such results for Pop III star formation
scenarios and for the most iron-poor halo star HE0107-5240.

with a very young dynamical age and extremely high near infrared luminosity. We
combine molecular spectroscopic data from the submillimeter to the near
infrared in order to interpret the rotational excitation of CO and the
ro-vibrational excitation of H2. We conclude that C-type shocks with a
paraboloidal bow shock geometry can simultaneously explain all the molecular
excitations. Extinction accounts for the deviation of the column densities from
local thermodynamic equilibrium. A difference in the extinction between the red
and blue-shifted outflow lobes may account for the measured flux difference.
The outflow is deeply embedded in a clump of density 10^5cm^-3, yet a good
fraction of atomic hydrogen, about 40%, is required to explain the excitation
and statistical equilibrium. We propose that this atomic component arises,
self-consistently, from the dissociated gas at the apex of the leading bow
shocks and the relatively long molecule reformation time. At least 20 bow
shocks are required in each lobe, although these may be sub-divided into
smaller bows and turbulent shocked regions. The total outflow mechanical power
and cooling amounts to over 30L_\odot, almost half the source's bolometric
luminosity. Nevertheless, only about 6% of the clump mass has been set in
outward motion by the outflow, allowing a collapse to continue.

present new wavelength- and phase-dependent limb darkening corrections based on
our time-dependent hydrodynamic models of the classical Cepheid zeta Gem. We
show that a model simulation of a Cepheid atmosphere, taking into account the
hydrodynamic effects associated with the pulsation, shows strong departures
from the limb darkening otherwise predicted by a static model. For most of its
pulsational cycle the hydrodynamic model predicts a larger limb darkening then
the equivalent static model. The hydrodynamics affects the limb darkening
mainly at UV and optical wavelengths. Most of these effects evolve slowly as
the star pulsates, but there are phases, associated with shocks propagating
into the photosphere, in which significant changes in the limb darkening take
place on time-scales of the order of less than a day. We assess the implication
of our model LD corrections fitting the geometric Baade-Wesselink distance of
zeta Gem for the available near-IR PTI data. We discuss the effects of our

that accretion disks around BHs consist of 1) a cold, Keplerian-rotating and
weakly magnetized mediumin the outer part, 2) a highly advective and
turbulent-free plasma inside $r_\mm{tr}=10-20$ Schwarzschild radii, where
magnetic fields are predominantly of large scale topology and in excess of
thermal equipartition, and 3) an ion-dominated torus in the vicinity of the
hole, where magnetic fields undergo a topological change into a monopole
like-configuration. The action of magnetic fields interior to $r_\mm{tr}$ is to
initiate torsional {\Alfven} waves that extract angular momentum from the
disk-plasma and deposit it into the transition layer (-TL) above the disk,
where the plasma is dissipative and tenuous. A significant fraction of the
shear-generated toroidal magnetic field reconnects in the TL, thereby heating
the plasma up to the virial-temperature and forming a super-Keplerian rotating,
and hence centrifugally accelerated outflow. The strong magnetic field in the
TL forces the electrons to cool rapidly yielding thereby an ion-dominated
outflow. The toroidal magnetic field in the TL is in thermal equipartition with
the ions, whereas the poloidal component is in equipartition with the
electrons. Such a strong toroidal magnetic field is essential for increasing
the jet-disk luminosity in the radio regime.

frequencies around 350 MHz. This ring is very prominent in Stokes Q and U, and
less so in polarized intensity P. No corresponding structure is visible in
total intensity Stokes I, which indicates that the ring is created by Faraday
rotation and depolarization processes. The polarization angle changes regularly
from the center of the ring outwards to a radius of more than 1.7 degrees.
Thus, the structure in polarization angle is not ring-like but resembles a
disk, and it is larger than the ring in P. The rotation measure (RM) decreases
almost continuously over the disk, from RM = 0 rad/m2 at the edge, to -8 rad/m2
in the center, while outside the ring the RM is slightly positive. This radial
variation of RM yields stringent constraints on the nature of the ring-like
structure, because it rules out any spherically symmetrical magnetic field
configuration, such as might be expected from supernova remnants or wind-blown
bubbles. We discuss several possible connections between the ring and known
objects in the ISM, and conclude that the ring is a predominantly magnetic
funnel-like structure. This description can explain both the field reversal
from outside to inside the ring, and the increase in magnitude of RM towards
the center of the ring. The ring-structure in P is most likely caused by a lack
of depolarization due to a very uniform RM distribution at that radius. Beyond
the ring, the RM gradient increases, depolarizing the polarized emission, so
that P decreases. In the SW corner of the field a pattern of narrow filaments
of low polarization, aligned with Galactic longitude, is observed, indicative
of beam depolarization due to abrupt changes in RM.

spectra are well fit when a broad, Gaussian-shaped absorption line with sigma =
100 eV and centered at an energy of 300 eV is added to an absorbed blackbody
model. The resulting equivalent width of the line is -150 eV. However, the
spectral resolution at these low energies of the EPIC detectors and the lower
statistical quality and restricted energy band of the RGS instruments are not
sufficient to exclude even broader lines at energies down to 100 eV or several
unresolved lines. The most likely interpretation of the absorption feature is a
cyclotron absorption line produced by protons in the magnetic field of the
neutron star. In this picture line energies of 100-300 eV yield a magnetic
field strength of 2-6x10^13 G for a neutron star with canonical mass and
radius. Folding light curves from different energy bands at a period of 10.31
s, which implies a double peaked pulse profile, shows different hardness ratios
for the two peaks. This confirms that the true spin period of RBS1223 is twice
as long as originally thought and suggests variations in cyclotron absorption
with pulse phase. We also propose that changes in photo-electric absorption
seen in phase resolved spectra of RX J0720.4-3125 by Cropper et al. (2001),
when formally fit with an absorbed blackbody model, are caused instead by
cyclotron absorption varying with pulse phase.

the data quantization alters the noise distribution and the expectation of some

introduces a power excess, that, although related to the instrument and mission

can be quite accurately subtracted, leaving a residual uncertainty of few % of

The color-color and hardness-intensity diagrams show significant secular shifts
of the atoll track, similar to what is observed for some Z sources. These are
most evident in the hardness-intensity diagram, where shifts in intensity up to
20% are observed. We find that the intensity shifts in the hardness-intensity

periodic oscillations frequency vs. intensity diagram. While the parallel
tracks in the frequency vs. color plane partially overlap, systematic long term
shifts are still evident. We also study the broad band power spectra of 4U

of an excess of power between 20 and 30 mHz, which can be fitted by a
Lorentzian. Also, the characteristic frequency of the band limited noise shows

explore the effects of small scale clustering in star-forming regions. A large
ensemble of small-N clusters with 5 stellar seeds have been modelled and the
resulting properties of stars and brown dwarfs statistically derived and
compared with observational data.
  Close dynamical interactions between the protostars and competitive accretion
driven by the cloud collapse are shown to produce a distribution of final
masses which is bimodal, with most of the mass residing in the binary
components. When convolved with a suitable core mass function, the final
distribution of masses resembles the observed IMF, both in the stellar and
sub-stellar regime. Binaries and single stars are found to constitute two
kinematically distinct populations, with about half of the singles attaining
velocities > 2 km/s, which might deprive low mass star-forming regions of their
lightest members in a few crossing times. The eccentricity distribution of
binaries and multiples is found to follow a distribution similar to that of
observed long period (uncircularized) binaries.
  We predict that many close binary stars should have wide brown dwarfs
companions. Brown dwarfs and, in general, very low mass stars, would be rare as
pure binary companions. The binary fraction should be a decreasing function of
primary mass, with low-mass or sub-stellar primaries being scarce. Where such
binaries exist, they are either expected to be close enough (semi-major axis ~
10 AU) to survive strong interactions with more massive binaries or else born
in very small molecular cloud cores.

Corrections are made to the data to account for area foreshortening and angle
between line of sight and field direction, and also the underestimation of the
flux densities. We make a systematic study of the evolution of the longitudinal
magnetic field, and analyze flare and CME occurrence in the magnetic evolution.
We find that the majority of CMEs and flares occur during or after new flux
emergence. The flux in all four active regions is observed to have deviations
from polarity balance both on the long-term (solar rotation) and on the short
term (few hours). The long-term imbalance is not due to linkage outside the
active region; it is primarily related to the east-west distance from central
meridian, with the sign of polarity closer to the limb dominating. The sequence
of short term imbalances are not closely linked to CMEs and flares and no
permanent imbalance remains after them. We propose that both kinds of imbalance
are due to the presence of a horizontal field component (parallel to the
photospheric surface) in the emerging flux.

In the absence of an applied magnetic field, the phase is steady-state (locked)
at low interlayer voltages, V<V_c, however the phase increases monotonically
with time (is unlocked) at V>V_c. The change in the system dynamics at V=V_c
gives rise to a peak in the differential tunneling conductance. The peak width
V_c is proportional to the absolute value of the tunneling matrix element
|T_{12}|, but its height does not depend on |T_{12}|; thus the peak is sharp
for small |T_{12}|. A sufficiently strong in-plane magnetic field reduces
considerably the peak height. The present results are in qualitative agreement

Bloch oscillations and the time for tunnelling across the band gap. Massive
disorder in the distribution of the fermions will wash out the interference

  ------------
  Dear sirs:
  I am a professor at Tokyo Institute of Technology. I wished to help a person
like R.Naboulsi who was trying very hard to get a fellowship to come to Japan.
I thought he was a really genius person to produce so many papers. He says most
of them are his original, but apparently not. Very regretful! I should have
noticed it much earlier.
  He has not come to Japan yet. I am the one who let him use the affiliation of
Tokyo Institute of Technology, as he asked me saying that it is the only way to
get the fellowship. I also asked my associate to upload because he says he
cannot from his computer.
  I sincerely apologize you for this unfortunate happening. I have asked my
associate to cancel all his papers uploaded already. Please understand that
this is done under a good will. He did not understand the basis of scientific
world. I just believed him too much.
  I hope you understand the situation.
  Sincerely Yours,
  Y.Watanabe,
  Prof. of Physics

In perturbative regime, we demonstrate the equivalence of the one-loop cusp
anomaly to the disk partition function in two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory
which admits a string representation. The strong coupling regime for anomalous
dimensions is discussed within the two pictures addressed recently, -- minimal
surfaces of open strings and rotating long closed strings in AdS background. In
the latter case we find that the integrability implies the presence of extra
degrees of freedom -- the string junctions. We demonstrate how the analysis of
their equations of motion naturally agrees with the spectrum found at weak
coupling.

relations. We show how the difference of structure between the Poisson brackets

oscillator whose positions and momenta mean values are not strictly equal to
the ones predicted by classical mechanics.
  This raises the question of the nature of quasi classical states in these
models. We propose an extension based on a variational principle. The action
considered is the sum of the absolute values of the expressions associated to
the non trivial Heisenberg uncertainty relations. We first verify that our
proposal works in the usual theory i.e we recover the known Gaussian functions.
Besides them, we find other states which can be expressed as products of
Gaussians with specific hyper geometrics.
  We illustrate our construction in two models defined on a four dimensional
phase space: a model endowed with a minimal length uncertainty and the non
commutative plane. Our proposal leads to second order partial differential
equations. We find analytical solutions in specific cases. We briefly discuss
how our proposal may be applied to the fuzzy sphere and analyze its
shortcomings.

asymptotically large systems, the zeros concentrate on phase boundaries which
are simple curves ending in multiple points. For models with an Ising-like

Theorem. This result allows us to control situations when in one region of the

a subproblem of this, worst-case risk assessment. Inspired by agent-based
models used for simulation of trail formation for urban planning, we use ant
colony optimization (ANTS) to determine possible avenues of approach for the
enemy, given a situation picture.
  One way of determining such avenues would be to calculate the ``potential
field'' caused by placing sources at possible goals for the enemy. This
requires postulating a functional form for the potential, and also takes long
time. Here we instead seek a method for quickly obtaining an effective
potential. ANTS, which has previously been used to obtain approximate solutions
to various optimization problems, is well suited for this. The output of our
method describes possible avenues of approach for the enemy, i.e, areas where
we should be prepared for attack. (The algorithm can also be run ``reversed''
to instead get areas of opportunity for our forces to exploit.)
  Using real geographical data, we found that our method gives a fast and
reliable way of determining such avenues. Our method can be used in a
computer-based command and control system to replace the first step of human
intelligence analysis.

significantly extended and further improved. We observe that it is not
sufficient to analyze only A and Z distributions of the product yields when

stochastic instabilities and deterministic instabilities. In the present paper,
the experimentally observed stochastic dynamics is described extensively. It is
shown that it exists a variety of dynamical behaviors, which differ by the
frequency components appearing in the dynamics. Indeed, some instabilities
exhibit only low frequency components, while in other cases, a second time
scale, corresponding to a higher frequency, appears in the motion of the center
of mass of the cloud. A one-dimensional stochastic model taking into account
the shadow effect is shown to be able to reproduce the experimental behavior,
linking the existence of instabilities to folded stationary solutions where

resonant matter is fulfilled, the probe amplification spectrum has a form of
spectral doublet. Stronger pumping leads to the appearance of a single peak of
the probe beam amplification at the transition frequency. The greater probe
intensity results in an asymmetrical transmission spectrum with amplification
at the blue wing of the absorption line and attenuation at the red one. Under
high medium density, a broad band of amplification appears. Theoretical model
is based on the solution of the Maxwell-Bloch equations for a two-level system.

complex dynamics of a coherent medium response to broadband polychromatic

A 68, 062312 (2003).","10.1103/PhysRevA.68.062312",,"quant-ph",,"  The study of quantum computation has been motivated by the hope of finding
efficient quantum algorithms for solving classically hard problems. In this
context, quantum algorithms by local adiabatic evolution have been shown to
solve an unstructured search problem with a quadratic speed-up over a classical
search, just as Grover's algorithm. In this paper, we study how the structure
of the search problem may be exploited to further improve the efficiency of
these quantum adiabatic algorithms. We show that by nesting a partial search
over a reduced set of variables into a global search, it is possible to devise
quantum adiabatic algorithms with a complexity that, although still
exponential, grows with a reduced order in the problem size.

bound on the locally accessible information. We analyze our bound and exhibit a
class of states which saturate it. Finally, we link the bound to the problem of
quantification of the nonlocality of the operations necessary to extract
locally unaccessible information.

size N with respect to the Bures measure and show that it is equal to that of a
N^2-1 dimensional hyper-halfsphere of radius 1/2. For N=2 we obtain the volume
of the Uhlmann 3-D hemisphere, embedded in R^4. We find also the area of the
boundary of the set M_N and obtain analogous results for the smaller set of all
real density matrices. An explicit formula for the Bures-Hall normalization
constants is derived for an arbitrary N.

matter dominated galaxies known, with a central mass to light ratio roughly
equal to 70. Somewhat anomalously, it appears to contain morphological
substructure in the form of a second peak in the stellar number density. It is
often argued that this substructure must be transient because it could not
survive for the > 10 Gyr age of the system, given the crossing time implied by
UMi's 8.8 km/s internal velocity dispersion. In this paper, however, we present
evidence that the substructure has a cold kinematical signature, and argue that
UMi's clumpiness could indeed be a primordial artefact. Using numerical
simulations, we demonstrate that substructure is incompatible with the cusped
dark matter haloes predicted by the prevailing Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm,
but is consistent with an unbound stellar cluster sloshing back and forth
within the nearly harmonic potential of a cored dark matter halo. Thus CDM
appears to disagree with observation at the least massive, most dark matter
dominated end of the galaxy mass spectrum.

with the astronomical data, practice, and theory behind the galaxy luminosity
function (LF). We treat galaxies as the building blocks of the Universe, but
ignore most aspects of their internal structures by considering them as point
sources. However, we do consider general morphological types in order to use
data from galaxy redshift surveys, where some kind of morphological
classification is adopted. We start with a general relativistic treatment for a
general spacetime, and then link the derived expressions with the LF definition
adopted in observational cosmology. Then equations for differential number
counts, the related relativistic density per source, and observed and total
relativistic energy densities of the universe, and other related quantities are
written in terms of the luminosity and selection functions. As an example of
how these theoretical/observational relationships can be used, we apply them to
test the LF parameters determined from the CNOC2 galaxy redshift survey, for
consistency with the Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) cosmology, which they assume, for
intermediate redshifts. We conclude that there is a general consistency for the
tests we carried out, namely both the observed relativistic mass-energy
density, and the observed relativistic mass-energy density per source, which is
equivalent to differential number counts, in an EdS Universe. In addition, we
find clear evidence of a large amount of hidden mass, as has been obvious from
many earlier investigations. At the same time, we find that the CNOC2 LF give
differential galaxy counts somewhat above the EdS predictions, indicating that
this survey observes more galaxies at 0.1 < z < 0.4 than the model's
predictions.

quark confinement model. Two equations of state are dynamically generated for
the {\it same} set of model parameters used to describe the nucleon: one
corresponds to a chiral restored phase with almost massless quarks and the
other to a chiral broken phase. The chiral symmetric phase saturates at around
five times the nuclear matter density. Using the equation of state for this
phase, compact bare quark stars are obtained with radii and masses in the

decreases very slowly from the center of the star to the periphery, remaining
above the corresponding values for the iron or the nuclear matter, even at the

may not be absolutely stable and the existence of an energy barrier between the

Sextans A has been actively forming stars at a high rate for ~ 2.5 Gyr ago,
with an increased rate beginning ~ 0.1 Gyr ago. We find a non-zero number of
stars older than 2.5 Gyr, due to the limited depth of the photometry, a
detailed star formation history at intermediate and older ages has considerable
uncertainties. The mean metallicity was found to be [M/H] ~- 1.4 over the
measured history of the galaxy, with most of the enrichment happening at ages
of at least 10 Gyr. We also find that an rms metallicity spread of 0.15 dex at
all ages allows the best fits to the observed CMD. We revisit our determination
of the recent star formation history (age <= 0.7 Gyr) using BHeB stars and find
good agreement for all but the last 25 Myr, a discrepancy resulting primarily
from different distances used in the two analyses and the differential
extinction in the youngest populations. This indicates that star formation
histories determined solely from BHeB stars should be confined to CMD regions
where no contamination from reddened MS stars is present.

certain choices of coupling parameters, the maximum neutron star mass can be
arbitrarily small. We also discuss the phenomenon of cosmological evolution of
VSL stars (analogous to the gravitational evolution in scalar-tensor theories)

type of brane models resolves the gauge hierarchy between the Planck and
electroweak scales through redshift effects due to the warp factor $a=e^{-\pi

find that, as in the Randall Sundrum case, the gauge field contribution to the
effective potential stabilises the hierarchy without fine-tuning as long as the
laplacian $\Delta_\Sigma$ on $\Sigma$ has a zero eigenvalue. Scalar fields can
stabilise the hierarchy depending on the mass and the non-minimal coupling. We
also address the quantum self-consistency of the solution, showing that the
classical brane solution is not spoiled by quantum effects.

constants of the ordinary cohomology ring H^*(G/B; Z) vanish in the Schubert
basis, and the rest are strictly positive. We present a combinatorial game, the
``root game'', which provides some criteria for determining which of the
Schubert intersection numbers vanish. The definition of the root game is
manifestly invariant under automorphisms of G, and under permutations of the
classes intersected. Although these criteria are not proven to cover all cases,
in practice they work very well, giving a complete answer to the question for
G=SL(7,C). In a separate paper we show that one of these criteria is in fact
necessary and sufficient when the classes are pulled back from a Grassmannian.
  More generally If G' -> G is an inclusion of complex reductive connected Lie
groups, there is an induced map H^*(G/B) -> H^*(G'/B') on the cohomology of the
homogeneous spaces. The image of a Schubert class under this map is a positive
sum of Schubert classes on G'/B'. We investigate the problem of determining
which Schubert classes appear with non-zero coefficient. This is the vanishing
problem for branching Schubert calculus, which plays an important role in
representation theory and symplectic geometry, as shown in [Berenstein-Sjamaar
2000]. The root game generalises to give a vanishing criterion and a
non-vanishing criterion for this problem.

These Lie algebras have a Poisson bracket structure. In this paper, the
isomorphism classes of these Lie algebras are determined by employing a
``sandwich'' method and by studying some features of these Lie algebras. It is
obtained that two Hamiltonian Lie algebras are isomorphic if and only if their
corresponding Poisson algebras are isomorphic. Furthermore, the derivation
algebras and the second cohomology groups are determined.

  entropy of information. Also includes smaller changes to text and figures to
  improve clarity",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.69.052103",,"physics.atom-ph quant-ph",,"  In a fundamental test of quantum mechanics, we have observed 228~000 quantum
jumps of a single trapped and laser cooled $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ion. This represents a
statistical increase of two orders of magnitude over previous similar analyses
of quantum jumps. Compared to other searches for non-randomness in quantum
mechanical processes, using quantum jumps simplifies the interpretation of data
by eliminated multi-particle effects and providing near-unit detection
efficiency of transitions. We measure the fractional reduction in the entropy
of information to be $< 6.5~10^{-4}$ when the value of any interval between
quantum jumps is known. We also find that the number of runs of successively
increasing or decreasing interval times agrees with the theoretically expected
values. Furthermore, we analyze 238~000 quantum jumps from two simultaneously
confined ions and find that the number of apparently coincidental transitions
is as expected. Finally, we observe 8400 spontaneous decays of two
simultaneously trapped ions and find that the number of apparently coincidental
decays from the metastable state agrees with the expected value. We find no
evidence for short- or long-term correlations in the intervals of the quantum
jumps or in the decay of the quantum states, in agreement with quantum theory.

  Backtranslation","17 pages, 13 figures. Submitted to Theor. Comp. Science",,,,"physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM",,"  Several technological applications require the translation of a protein into
a nucleic acid that codes for it (``backtranslation''). The degeneracy of the
genetic code makes this translation ambiguous; moreover, not every translation
is equally viable. The common answer to this problem is the imitation of the
codon usage of the target species. Here we discuss several other features of
coding sequences (``coding statistics'') that are relevant for the ``genomic
style'' of different species. A genetic algorithm is then used to obtain
backtranslations that mimic these styles, by minimizing the difference in the
coding statistics. Possible improvements and applications are discussed.

identifying three different scales in the problem, which then are treated
independently: An asymptotic scale, which depends uniquely on the form of the
potential at large distances; an intermediate scale, still characterized by an
exponential decay of the wave function and, finally, a short distance scale, in
which the wave function is sizable. The key feature of our method is the
introduction of an arbitrary parameter in the last two scales, which is then
used to optimize a perturbative expansion in a suitable parameter. We apply the
method to the quantum anharmonic oscillator and find excellent results.

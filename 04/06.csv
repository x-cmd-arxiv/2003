continuum emission, while measurements at offset positions indicate that H2D+
is confined within ~ 20 arcsec, where CO is highly depleted. The derived H2D+
abundance of ~ 10^{-9} is comparable with previous estimates of the electron
abundance in the core, which suggests that H2D+ is the main molecular ion in
the central 20 arcsec (2800 AU) of L1544. This confirms the expectations that
H2D+ is dramatically enhanced in gas depleted of molecules other than H2. The
measured abundance even exceeds the present model predictions by about a factor
ten. One possibility is that all CNO-bearing neutral species, including atomic
oxygen, are almost completely (> 98%) frozen within a radius of ~2800 AU.

mercury in conventional rotating liquid mirrors. The main advantages offered
include extremely low cost and, by coating a viscous liquid, the possibility of
tilting the mirror by a few tens of degrees. We also have coated ferromagnetic
liquids with these reflecting films. The resulting surfaces can be shaped by
the application of a magnetic field, yielding reflecting surfaces that can have
complicated shapes that can rapidly shift with time. These inexpensive and

equation remains the same and defines the so called hyperspherical harmonics.
For non-central models, the situation is more complicated. We contemplate two
examples in the plane: (1) the partial differential Calogero's three-body model
(without centre of mass and with an impenetrable core in the two-body
interaction), and (2) the Smorodinsky-Winternitz' superintegrable harmonic
oscillator (with one or two impenetrable barriers). These examples are solvable
due to the presence of the barriers. We contemplate a small complex shift of
the angle. This creates a problem: the barriers become ""translucent"" and the
angular potentials cease to be solvable, having the sextuple-well form for
Calogero model and the quadruple or double well form otherwise. We mimic the
effect of these potentials on the spectrum by the multiple, purely imaginary
square wells and tabulate and discuss the result in the first nontrivial
double-well case.

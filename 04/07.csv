AG should begin to reveal the lightcurve, spectrum and polarization of an
underlying SN --akin to SN1998bw-- which will peak in the NIR/optical band
around day 15. These effects will be easily observable if indeed SN1998bw is a
good ``standard candle'' for GRB-associated SNe and if the so far unknown

forward shocks in winds. An optical flash mainly arises from the relativistic
reverse shock while a radio flare is produced by the forward shock. The peak
flux densities of optical flashes are larger than 1 Jy for typical parameters,
if we do not take into account some appropriate dust obscuration along the line
of sight. The radio flare always has a long lasting constant flux, which will
not be covered up by interstellar scintillation. The non-detections of optical

investigated in order to understand the nature of these systems. The
observational data on chemical abundances of DLAs are analysed with robust
statistical methods, and the abundances are corrected for dust depletion. The
results of this analysis are compared to predictions of several classes of
chemical evolution models: one-zone dwarf galaxy models, multizone disk models,
and chemodynamical models representing dwarf galaxies. We compare the
observational data on the [alpha/Fe] and [N/alpha] ratios to the predictions
from the models. In DLAs, these ratios are only partially reproduced by the
dwarf galaxy one-zone model and by the disk model. On the other hand, the
chemodynamical model for dwarf galaxies reproduces the properties of nearly all
DLAs. We derive the formation epoch of dwarf galaxies, and we find that dwarf
galaxies make a significant contribution to the total neutral gas density in
DLAs, and that this contribution is more important at high redshifts (z > 2-3).
We propose a scenario in which the DLA population is dominated by dwarf
galaxies at high redshifts and by disks at lower redshifts. We also find that
Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) may constitute a sequence rather than present a
sharp dichotomy between the two populations. We also arise the possibility that
we could be missing a whole population of high HI density column objects, with
metallicities intermediate between those of DLAs and LBGs. Finally, we discuss
the possibility that relying only on the observations of DLAs could lead to an
underestimate of the metal content of the high redshift Universe.

activation energies as a function of current density and applied field were
calculated from dynamic magnetisation relaxation measurements. A dimensional
crossover from a 3D elastic creep regime to 2D plastic creep was observed in
the nonirradiated tape at an applied magnetic field Hcr = 0.37 T, with an
associated change in the flux hop velocity and temperature dependence of the
activation energy. After introduction of the fission-fragment damage by
irradiation, a shift in the crossover to Hcr = 0.65 T was observed. These
results indicate an enhancement of the c-axis vortex coherence by the
introduced splayed columnar defects, explaining the greater pinning efficiency
of the uranium-fission method in Bi2223 rather than the less anisotropic Y123.
Conflicting results obtained for the irradiated tape in the absence of any
temperature scaling of the activation energies demonstrate the importance of
the inclusion of scaling in the magnetisation relaxation analysis.

their asymptotic behaviour and to propose an approximate analytical form for
the 'terminator' of the Green's function continued fraction expansion for the

singularity corresponding to the incoherent part of the spectrum. The method is
applied to the spectral function of one-hole in the Majumdar-Ghosh model (the
one-dimensional $ t-J-J^{\prime}$ model at $J^{\prime}/J=1/2$). For this model,
the branch cut starts at finite energy $\omega_0$, but there is no upper bound
of the spectrum, corresponding to a linear increase of the recursion
coefficients. Further characteristics of the spectral function are band gaps in
the middle of the band and bound states below $\omega_0$ or within the gaps.
The band gaps arise due to the period doubling of the unit cell and show up as
characteristic oscillations of the recursion coefficients on top of the linear
increase.

essentially nonmonotonic: by increasing an external magnetic field the current
passes though a maximum, while the 0-phase state is held, and then the junction

densities, there are only independent single color sources, no fluctuations
occurs and the distribution is described by a single exponential. At very high
densities, only one cluster of many color sources appears and therefore there
are not fluctuations either and the hardness of the distribution is suppressed.
The Cronin effect in this framework is due to a maximum of the fluctuations
which decreases as the density increases. We obtain a good agreement with
experimental data including the low $p_T$ behaviour and the spectra for
different particles. We show that the transverse momentum and multiplicity

small radius in Poincare coordinates. A picture of strings made up of
noninteracting bits emerges in the zero radius limit. In this limit, each bit
behaves like a superparticle moving in the AdS_5 \times S^5 background,
carrying appropriate representations of the super conformal group PSU(2,2|4).
The standard Hamiltonian operator which causes evolution in the light-cone time
has continuous eigenvalues and provides a basis of states which is not suitable
for comparing with the dual super Yang-Mills theory. However, there exist
operators in the light-cone gauge which have discrete spectra and can be used
to label the states. We obtain the spectrum of single bit states and construct
multi-bit states in this basis. There are difficulties in the construction of
string states from the multi-bit states, which we discuss. A non-zero value of
the radius introduces interactions between the bits and the spectrum of
multi-bit states gets modified. We compute the leading perturbative corrections
at small radius for a few simple cases. Potential divergences in the
perturbative corrections, arising from strings near the boundary, cancel. This
encourages us to believe that our perturbative treatment could provide a
framework for a rigorous and detailed testing of the AdS/CFT conjecture, once
the difficulties in the construction of string states are resolved.

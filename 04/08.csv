  (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Most of the local active galactic nucleus (AGN) population is obscured and
much of the X-ray background originates in obscured AGNs. The contribution of
obscured accretion to the growth of massive black holes is discussed here. The
recent identification of significant samples of the X-ray sources that dominate
the X-ray background intensity has shown a redshift peak at 0.7-0.8, rather
than the redshift of 2 found for bright optical quasars. Obscured accretion has
a faster evolution than unobscured accretion. The lower redshift and luminosity
of most obscured AGNs mean that although they dominate the absorption-corrected
intensity of the X-ray background by a factor of about 3 over unobscured
objects, they make only an equal contribution to the local mass density in
black holes. Obscured and unobscured AGNs together contribute about 4 x 10^5
Msun/Mpc^3. Type 2 quasars and Compton-thick objects may give another 10^5
Msun/Mpc^3, but no more unless direct determinations from the M-sigma relation
seriously underestimate the local black hole mass density, or unless most
massive black holes are rapidly spinning (so having a higher radiative
efficiency than the 10% assumed above). Obscured accretion probably dominates
the growth of black holes with masses below a few times 10^8 Msun, whereas
optically bright quasars dominate at higher masses. The luminosity absorbed by
the dusty gas in obscured AGNs is reradiated in the mid-infrared and
far-infrared bands. The contribution of AGNs drops from about 20% of the
mid-infrared background to just a few percent of the far-infrared background.

history of star formation. In particular, we predict that the nova rates in
giant ellipticals such as M87 are 100-300 nova/yr, about a factor of ten larger
than in our Galaxy (25 nova/yr), in agreement with very recent estimates from
HST data. The best agreement with the observed rates is obtained if the
recurrence time of novae in ellipticals is assumed to be longer than in the
Milky Way. This result indicates that the star formation rate in ellipticals,
and in particular in M87, must have been very efficient at early cosmic epochs.
We predict a nova rate for the LMC of 1.7 nova/yr, again in agreement with
observations. We compute also the K- and B-band luminosities for ellipticals of
different luminous mass and conclude that there is not a clear trend for the
luminosity specific nova rate with luminosity among these galaxies. However,
firm conclusions about ellipticals cannot be drawn because of possible
observational biases in observing these objects. The comparison between the
specific nova rates in the Milky Way and the LMC indicates a trend of
increasing nova rate passing from the Galaxy towards late-type spirals and
Magellanic irregulars.

2001). Here we point out that X-ray flares should be expected from star
passages through an inactive (i.e. formerly accreting) disk. There are
thousands of stars in Sgr A* stellar cluster, and each star will pass through
the disk twice per orbit. A shock hot enough to emit X-rays is formed around
the star when the latter is inside the disk. We develop a simple yet somewhat
detailed model for the X-ray emission from the shock. The duration of the
flares, their X-ray spectra, frequency of events, and weakness of emission in
the radio and near infra-red appear to be consistent with the available
observations of X-ray flares. We therefore suggest that at least a fraction of
the observed flares is due to the star-disk passages. Such star-disk flares are
also of interest in the nuclei of nearby inactive galaxies, especially in
connection with perspective Constellation-X and XEUS X-ray missions.

hypotheses that (1) star formation in spheroids and BH fueling are proportional
to one another, and (2) the BH accretion luminosity stays near the Eddington
limit during luminous quasar phases. With the aid of this simple model, we are
able to interpret many properties of the QSO luminosity function, including the
puzzling steep decline of the characteristic luminosity from redshift z=2 to to
z=0: indeed the residual star formation in spheroidal systems is today limited
to a small number of bulges, characterized by stellar velocity dispersions a
factor of 2-3 smaller those of the elliptical galaxies hosting QSOs at z > 2. A
simple consequence of our hypotheses is that the redshift evolution of the QSO
emissivity and of the star formation history in spheroids should be roughly
parallel. We find this result to be broadly consistent with our knowledge of
the evolution of both the global star formation rate, and of the evolution of
the QSO emissivity, but we identify interesting discrepancies at both low and
high redshifts, to which we offer tentative solutions. Finally, our hypotheses
allow us to present a robust method to derive the duty cycle of QSO activity,
based on the observed QSO luminosity function, and on the present-day relation
between the masses of supermassive BHs and those of their spheroidal host
stellar systems. The duty cycle is found to be substantially less than unity,
with characteristic values in the range (3-6)x10^(-3), and we compute that the
average bolometric radiative efficiency is epsilon=0.07. Finally, we find that
the growth in mass of individual black holes at high redshift (z>2) can be
dominated by mergers, and is therefore not necessarily limited by accretion.

Compton reflection component R~0.6-1 (depending on the inclination angle
between the line of sight and the reflecting material) and a high-energy cutoff
at around 200 keV; there is also an iron line at 6.4 keV characterized by an
equivalent width of 120 eV. Seyfert 2's on the other hand show stronger neutral
absorption (NH=3-4 x 10^{22} atoms cm-2) as expected but are also characterized
by an X-ray power law which is substantially harder (Gamma~1.75) and with a
cut-off at lower energies (E_c~130 keV); the iron line parameters are instead
substantially similar to those measured in type 1 objects. There are only two
possible solutions to this problem: to assume more reflection in Seyfert 2
galaxies than observed in Seyfert 1 or more complex absorption than estimated
in the first instance. The first possibility is ruled out by the Seyfert 2 to
Seyfert 1 ratio while the second provides an average Seyfert 2 intrinsic
spectrum very similar to that of the Seyfert 1. The extra absorber is likely an
artifact due to summing spectra with different amounts of absorption, althought
we cannot exclude its presence in at least some individual sources. Our result
argues strongly for a very similar central engine in both type of galaxies as

hard flare in the energy range above 15 keV preceded the soft X-ray peak. The
hard X-ray flux of the hard flares at maximum was more than a factor of three
stronger than at any other point in the outbursts. The rise of the hard X-ray
flare to this maximum, was consistent with a monotonically brightening low/hard
state spectrum. After the peak of the hard flare, a sharp spectral transition
occurred with spectral pivoting in the range 8--12 keV. Our timing analysis
shows that during the hard flare the power spectra were mainly composed of
band-limited noise and a $\sim$ 1--20 Hz QPO, which correlate in frequency.
Immediately after the hard flare, the power spectra turned into power law
noise. The spectral and timing properties during and after the hard flares are

the RC absolute magnitude in V, I and K, by applying our empirical main
sequence fitting method, which utilizes a large sample of local field dwarfs
with accurate HIPPARCOS parallaxes. The age and metallicity range of these 9
clusters enable us to make a quantitative assessment of the age and metallicity
dependencies of the population corrections predicted by the theoretical models
of Girardi & Salaris (2001). We find excellent agreement between the empirical
data and the models in all 3 pass-bands, with no statistically significant
trends or offsets, thus fully confirming the applicability of the models to
single-age, single-metallicity stellar populations. Since, from the models, the
population correction is a complicated function of both metallicity and age, if
this method is used to derive distances to composite populations, it is
essential to have an accurate assessment of the SFR and AMR of the system in
question, if errors of several tenths of a magnitude are to be avoided.

antenna system composed of several reflector surfaces. Typically, at
mm-wavelengths, telescopes are composed of mirrors and shields, and an accurate
prediction of the whole system response is therefore complicated. This is the
case for the optical system of the ESA Planck mission. Planck represents the
third generation of mm-wave instruments designed for space observations of CMB
anisotropies over the whole sky, and has unprecedented sensitivity and angular
resolution. The Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) is one of the two instruments
onboard the satellite. LFI consists of an array of 46 cooled HEMT-based
receivers coupled to the 1.5 meter off-axis dual reflector telescope by an
array of 23 dual profiled corrugated feed horns working at four frequencies
between 30 and 100 GHz. Owing to the small level of CMB anisotropies, the
control of the systematic effects is mandatory, and this is assured by means of
a dedicated instrument design and by an accurate knowledge of instrument
characteristics. The telescope is a source of systematic errors both in the
main beam region (aberrations) and in the sidelobes region (straylight
contamination) and efficient and accurate radiation pattern simulations of the
telescope-feed system are needed. We report on the simulations of the full
pattern applied to the Planck/LFI-Telescope system. These simulations, based on
advanced GTD methods, are used to evaluate the straylight rejection of the
entire optical system, by applying a new approach for evaluating the sidelobes
in a rigorous way, even at very low levels.

The dominant period and amplitude of pulsation have been derived and the stars
have been classified as Mira or Semi-Regular pulsators. Furthermore, the
cross-identification with near-infrared DENIS and 2MASS magnitudes available
within the ISO-MCMS allowed us: (i) to investigate the properties of these
stars in the combined near- and mid-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams, (ii) to
derive the bolometric magnitude by integrating the spectral energy distribution
and (iii) to estimate the mass-loss rate. The stars have been divided into
carbon- (C-) and oxygen-rich (O-rich) using the (J-Ks, Ks) colour-magnitude
diagram and their period and amplitude distributions have been compared. C-rich
AGB stars have a sharp peak in their period distribution at about 250 days and
have on average a larger amplitude than O-rich AGB stars. This effect, not
previously detected from the study of similar stars in the LMC and in the
Baade's window, might be closely related to the metallicity of the environment
in which the stars have formed.

first derive the $^{56}$Ni mass from the $M_V$ magnitude on the radioactive
tail using a standard approach. A confirmation of the correlation between
$^{56}$Ni mass and plateau $M_V$ magnitude found recently by Hamuy (2003) is
evident. There is strong evidence of a correlation between steepness of the $V$
light curve slope at the inflection time and the $^{56}$Ni mass. If confirmed,
this relation may provide distance and extinction independent estimates of the
amount of $^{56}$Ni in SNe IIP. We then apply upgraded radioactive models of
H$\alpha$ luminosity at the nebular epoch and claim that it may be a good
indicator of $^{56}$Ni, if mass, energy and mixing properties vary moderately
(within factor $\sim 1.4$) among SNe IIP . This method of the $^{56}$Ni mass
determination from H$\alpha$ luminosities yields results which are consistent
with the photometric mass of $^{56}$Ni mass to within 20%. This result also
implies that the parameters of SNe IIP events (mass, energy and mixing
properties) are rather similar among the majority of SNe IIP, except for rare
cases of SN II intermediate between IIP and IIL (linear), of which SN 1970G is
an example.

corresponding simulation results for several thermodynamic properties. Then we
have determined the phase diagram of the model, by using either the SCOZA, or
the MHNC, or the PT predictions for one of the coexisting phases, and the
simulation data for the other phase, in order to separately ascertain the
accuracy of each theory. It turns out that the overall appearance of the phase
portrait is reproduced fairly well by all theories, with remarkable accuracy as
for the melting line and the solid-vapor equilibrium. The MHNC and SCOZA
results for the liquid-vapor coexistence, as well as for the corresponding
critical points, are quite accurate. All results are discussed in terms of the
basic assumptions underlying each theory. We have selected the MHNC for the
fluid and the first-order PT for the solid phase, as the most accurate tools to
investigate the phase behavior of the model in terms of purely theoretical
approaches. The overall results appear as a robust benchmark for further
theoretical investigations on higher order C(n>60) fullerenes, as well as on

"cs/0304009","Gilles Daniel","Gilles Daniel","Stochastic Volatility in a Quantitative Model of Stock Market Returns","MSc thesis (2002), 83 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.CE",,"  Standard quantitative models of the stock market predict a log-normal
distribution for stock returns (Bachelier 1900, Osborne 1959), but it is
recognised (Fama 1965) that empirical data, in comparison with a Gaussian,
exhibit leptokurtosis (it has more probability mass in its tails and centre)
and fat tails (probabilities of extreme events are underestimated). Different
attempts to explain this departure from normality have coexisted. In
particular, since one of the strong assumptions of the Gaussian model concerns
the volatility, considered finite and constant, the new models were built on a
non finite (Mandelbrot 1963) or non constant (Cox, Ingersoll and Ross 1985)
volatility. We investigate in this thesis a very recent model (Dragulescu et
al. 2002) based on a Brownian motion process for the returns, and a stochastic
mean-reverting process for the volatility. In this model, the forward
Kolmogorov equation that governs the time evolution of returns is solved
analytically. We test this new theory against different stock indexes (Dow
Jones Industrial Average, Standard and Poor s and Footsie), over different
periods (from 20 to 105 years). Our aim is to compare this model with the
classical Gaussian and with a simple Neural Network, used as a benchmark. We
perform the usual statistical tests on the kurtosis and tails of the expected
distributions, paying particular attention to the outliers. As claimed by the
authors, the new model outperforms the Gaussian for any time lag, but is
artificially too complex for medium and low frequencies, where the Gaussian is
preferable. Moreover this model is still rejected for high frequencies, at a
0.05 level of significance, due to the kurtosis, incorrectly handled.

as $\sim 180 {\rm MeV}$, we see the quenched chiral logs clearly in
$m_{\pi}^2/m$ and $f_P$, the pseudoscalar decay constant. We analyze the data
to determine how low the pion mass needs to be in order for the quenched
one-loop chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) to apply. With the constrained
curve-fitting method, we are able to extract the quenched chiral log parameter
$\delta$ together with other low-energy parameters. Only for $m_{\pi} \leq 300
{\rm MeV}$ do we obtain a consistent and stable fit with a constant $\delta$
which we determine to be 0.24(3)(4) (at the chiral scale $\Lambda_{\chi}=0.8
{\rm GeV}$). By comparing to the $12^3 \times 28$ lattice, we estimate the
finite volume effect to be about 2.7% for the smallest pion mass. We also
fitted the pion mass to the form for the re-summed cactus diagrams and found
that its applicable region is extended farther than the range for the one-loop
formula, perhaps up to $m_{\pi} \sim 500-600$ MeV. The scale independent
$\delta$ is determined to be 0.20(3) in this case. We study the quenched
non-analytic terms in the nucleon mass and find that the coefficient $C_{1/2}$
in the nucleon mass is consistent with the prediction of one-loop $\chi$PT\@.
We also obtain the low energy constant $L_5$ from $f_{\pi}$. We conclude from
this study that it is imperative to cover only the range of data with the pion
mass less than $\sim 300 {\rm MeV}$ in order to examine the chiral behavior of
the hadron masses and decay constants in quenched QCD and match them with
quenched one-loop $\chi$PT\@.

probability of obtaining a peak of strength S or more by chance at a specified
frequency is exp(-S). This inevitably leads to severe aliasing of the power
spectrum. The strongest peak in the range 0 - 100 in a power spectrum formed by
a likelihood procedure is at 26.57 (period 13.75 days) with S = 11.26. For the

alias of the stronger peak at 26.57. We note that 26.57 falls in the band 26.36

equatorial section of the Sun for normalized radius larger than 0.1.

transformations and \emph{``ipso facto''} they lead to problems when we try
quantizing them straightforwardly. To circumvent this problem we need to
specify a gauge condition to fix the gauge so that the fields that are
connected by gauge invariance are not overcounted in the process of
quantization. The usual way we do this in the light-front is through the
introduction of a Lagrange multiplier, $(n\cdot A)^{2}$, where $n_{\mu}$ is the
external light-like vector, i.e., $n^{2}=0$, and $A_{\mu}$ is the vector
potential. This leads to the usual light-front propagator with all the ensuing
characteristics such as the prominent $(k\cdot n)^{-1}$ pole which has been the
subject of much research. However, it has been for long recognized that this
procedure is incomplete in that there remains a residual gauge freedom still to
be fixed by some ``ad hoc'' prescription, and this is normally worked out to
remedy some unwieldy aspect that emerges along the way. In this work we propose
\emph{two} Lagrange multipliers with distinct coefficients for the light-front
gauge that leads to the correctly defined propagator with no residual gauge
freedom left. This is accomplished via $(n\cdot A)^2+(\partial \cdot A)^2$
terms in the Lagrangian density. These lead to a well-defined and exact though
Lorentz non invariant propagator.

weak versions of the Tau Conjecture and in so doing show that the Tau
Conjecture follows from an even more plausible hypothesis.
  Our results follow from a new p-adic analogue of earlier work relating real
algebraic geometry to additive complexity. For instance, we can show that a
nonzero univariate polynomial of additive complexity s can have no more than
15+s^3(s+1)(7.5)^s s! =O(e^{s\log s}) roots in the 2-adic rational numbers Q_2,
thus dramatically improving an earlier result of the author. This immediately
implies the same bound on the number of ordinary rational roots, whereas the
best previous upper bound via earlier techniques from real algebraic geometry
was a quantity in Omega((22.6)^{s^2}).

exchange component of the $NN$ potential, which emphasizes the role of
intermediate $\pi N$ subamplitudes. The relationship between power counting in
$\pi N$ and $NN$ processes is discussed and results are expressed directly in
terms of observable subthreshold coefficients. Interactions are determined by
one- and two-loop diagrams, involving pions, nucleons, and other degrees of
freedom, frozen into empirical subthreshold coefficients. The full evaluation
of these diagrams produces amplitudes containing many different loop integrals.
Their simplification by means of relations among these integrals leads to a set
of intermediate results. Subsequent truncation to $O(q^4)$ yields the
relativistic potential, which depends on six loop integrals, representing
bubble, triangle, crossed box, and box diagrams. The bubble and triangle
integrals are the same as in $\pi N$ scattering and we have shown that they
also determine the chiral structures of box and crossed box integrals.
Relativistic threshold effects make our results to be not equivalent with those
of the heavy baryon approach. Performing a formal expansion of our results in
inverse powers of the nucleon mass, even in regions where this expansion is not
valid, we recover most of the standard heavy baryon results. The main
differences are due to the Goldberger-Treiman discrepancy and terms of
$O(q^3)$, possibly associated with the iteration of the one-pion exchange
potential.

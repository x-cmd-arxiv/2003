Hidden Broad Line Regions (HBLRs) in Seyfert 2 galaxies is regulated by the
rate at which matter accretes onto a central supermassive black hole, in units
of Eddington rate. We use the intrinsic (i.e. unabsorbed) X-ray luminosities of
these sources and their black hole masses (estimated by using the well known
relationship between nuclear mass and bulge luminosity in galaxies) to derive
the nuclear accretion rate in units of Eddington. We find that virtually all
HBLR sources have accretion rate larger than a threshold value of
$\dot{m}_{thres} \simeq 10^{-3}$ (in Eddington units), while non-HBLR sources
lie at $\dot{m} \ls \dot{m}_{thres}$.
  These data nicely fit predictions from a model proposed by Nicastro (2000),
in which the Broad Line Regions (BLRs) are formed by accretion disk
instabilities occurring in proximity of the critical radius at which the disk
changes from gas pressure dominated to radiation pressure dominated. This
radius diminishes with decreasing accretion rates; for low enough accretion
rates (and therefore luminosities), the critical radius becomes smaller than
the innermost stable orbit, and BLRs cannot form.

has approximately the same speed and direction as an earlier superluminal

that either galaxies on the red sequence formed a long time ago (z>2) or else
their star formation is universally delayed with preservation of a small spread
in age formation. The latter possibility is ruled out by the mere existence of
galaxies at high redshift. While the old age of ellipticals was already been
claimed for a small heterogeneous collection of clusters, most of which are
rich ones, we found that it holds for a ten to one hundred larger sample,
representative of all clusters and groups detected on the EDR--SDSS. Hence, we
claim the possible universality of the color of the galaxies on the red

(also called groups), not studied in previous works, for which the hierarchical
and monolithic scenarios of elliptical formation predict different colors for
the brightest ellipticals. The observed red sequence color does not depend on
cluster/group richness at a level of 0.02 mag, while a 0.23 mag effect is
expected according to the hierarchical prediction. Therefore, the stellar

present tailored photoionization models based on improved calculations with
respect to previous models. In particular, we use the photoionization models to
study quantitatively the effect of collisional excitation of Balmer lines on
the determination of the helium abundance (Y) in the individual regions. This
effect is twofold: first, the intensities of the Balmer lines are enhanced with
respect to the pure recombination value, mimicking a higher hydrogen abundance;
second, the observed reddening is larger than the true extinction, due to the
differential effect of collisions on different Balmer lines. In addition to
these effects, our analysis takes into account the following features of HII
regions: (i) the temperature structure, (ii) the density structure, (iii) the
presence of neutral helium, (iv) the collisional excitation of the HeI lines,
(v) the underlying absorption of the HeI lines, and (vi) the optical thickness
of the HeI lines. The object that shows the highest increase in Y after the

starburst provides over half the IR emission, with a mean fractional luminosity
of 82%. When combined with other galaxy samples we find that starburst and AGN
luminosities correlate over 6 decades in IR luminosity suggesting that a common
factor governs both luminosities, plausibly the gas masses in the nuclear

indication of the starburst luminosity, or the fractional AGN luminosity, and
therefore that this ratio is not a reliable diagnostic of the power source in
ULIRGs. We propose that the scatter in the radio-IR correlation in ULIRGs is
due to a skewed starburst IMF and/or relic relativistic electrons from a
previous starburst, rather than contamination from an obscured AGN. We show
that most ULIRGs undergo multiple starbursts during their lifetime, and by
inference that mergers between more than two galaxies may be common amongst
ULIRGs. Our results support the evolutionary model for ULIRGs proposed by
Farrah et al 2001, where they can follow many different evolutionary paths of
starburst and AGN activity in transforming merging spiral galaxies into
elliptical galaxies, but that most do not go through an optical QSO phase. The
lower level of AGN activity in our local sample than in z~1 HLIRGs implies that
the two samples are distinct populations. We postulate that different galaxy

crucial parameters on the continuum spectrum of synchrotron radiation without
the more complex modeling of spectral ageing scenarios. An important merit of
the SCP-$alpha$ diagram is the enhanced reliability of extracting multiple
injection spectra, $alpha_{inj}$. Different from the colour-colour diagram,
tracks of different $alpha_{inj}$s, especially when the synchrotron particles
are young, exhibit less overlap and less smearing in the SCP-$alpha$ diagram.
Three giant radio galaxies(GRGs) and a sample of Compact steep spectrum(CSS)
souces are presented. GRGs exhibit asymmetries of their injection spectral
indices $alpha_{inj}$ in the SCP-$alpha_{high}$ diagram. The obtained
$alpha_{inj}$s and the trends in the sources are cross-checked with the
literature and show remarkable confidence. Besides the spectral steepening,
spectral flattening is prominent in the radio lobes. The spectral flattening is
a clue to efficient re-acceleration processes in the lobes. It implies
interaction with the surrounding intergalactic or intra-cluster medium is an
important characteristic of GRGs. In the SW lobe of DA240, there is a clear
sign of CI and KP/JP bifurcation at the source extremity. This indicates a
highly relativistic energy transportation from the core or in situ acceleration
in this typical FR I lobe. Our analysis proves, if exists, KP spectra imply the
existence of strong $B_{sync}$ field with $B_{sync} > B_{CMB}$. In the CSS
sources, our result confirms the CI model and $B_{sync} >> B_{CMB}$. The
synchrotron self-absorption is significant in the CSS sample.

universe, and recovers the observed optical and X-ray luminosity functions of
quasars at redshifts up to z~6 based on the hierarchical evolution of galaxy
halos in a Lambda-CDM cosmology. With only one free parameter and a simple
algorithm, our model yields the observed evolution in the number density of
optically bright or X-ray faint quasars between 2<z<6 across 3 orders of
magnitude in bolometric luminosity and 3 orders of magnitude in comoving
density per logarithm of luminosity. The self-regulation condition identifies
the dynamical time of galactic disks during the epoch of peak quasar activity
(z~2.5) as the origin of the inferred characteristic quasar lifetime of ~10
million years. Since the lifetime becomes comparable to the Salpeter e-folding
time at this epoch, the model also implies that the Mbh-sigma relation is a
product of feedback regulated accretion during the peak of quasar activity. The
mass-density in black-holes accreted by that time is consistent with the local
black-hole mass density of ~(0.8-6.3) times 10^5 solar masses per cubic Mpc,
which we have computed by combining the Mbh-sigma relation with the measured
velocity dispersion function of SDSS galaxies (Sheth et al.~2003). Applying a
similar self-regulation principle to supernova-driven winds from starbursts, we
find that the ratio between the black hole mass and the stellar mass of
galactic spheroids increases with redshift as (1+z)^1.5 although the Mbh-sigma
relation is redshift-independent.

relativistic properties of star and its disk. As we know, the Hartle-Thorne
metric can describe geometry of star as well as the space-time out-side of it,

stable orbit exactly as that of general relativity. It also reproduces the
marginally bound orbit and specific mechanical energy at the marginally stable
orbit with at most 4% and 10% error respectively. Using this potential we study
the global parameter space of the accretion disk. Thus, we find out the

rotation to the central object, the valid disk parameter region dramatically

cosmological clustering of radio sources is roughly constant at A~0.001 from 3
to 40 mJy, but has increased to A~0.007 at 200 mJy. This can be explained if
powerful (FRII) radio galaxies probe more massive structures at z~1 compared to
average power radio galaxies, consistent with powerful high-z radio galaxies
generally having massive (forming) elliptical hosts in rich cluster
environments. For FRIIs we derive a spatial (comoving) correlation length of
r_0=14\pm3 h^{-1} Mpc. This is close to that measured for extremely red objects
(EROs) associated with a population of old elliptical galaxies at z~1 by Daddi
et al. (2001). Based on their similar clustering properties, we propose that
EROs and powerful radio galaxies may be the same systems seen at different
evolutionary stages. Their r_0 is ~2 times higher than that of QSOs at a
similar redshift, and comparable to that of bright ellipticals locally. This
suggests that r_0 (comoving) of these galaxies has changed little from z~1 to
z=0, in agreement with current LCDM hierarchical models for clustering
evolution of massive early-type galaxies. Alternatively, the clustering of
radio galaxies can be explained by the galaxy conservation model. This then
implies that radio galaxies of average power are the progenitors of the local
early-type field population, while the most powerful radio galaxies will evolve
into a present-day population with r_0 similar to that of local rich clusters.

displacement field $\bi u$ and the lattice velocity ${\bi v}=\p {\bi u}/\p t$.
Damping is assumed to arise from the shear viscosity in the momentum equation.
The elastic energy density is a periodic function of the shear and tetragonal
strains, which enables formation of slips at large strains. In this work we
neglect defects such as vacancies, interstitials, or grain boundaries. The
simplest slip consists of two edge dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors.
The formation energy of a slip is minimized if its orientation is parallel or
perpendicular to the flow in simple shear deformation and if it makes angles of
$\pm \pi/4$ with respect to the stretched direction in uniaxial stretching.
  High-density dislocations produced in plastic flow do not disappear even if
the flow is stopped. Thus large applied strains give rise to metastable,
structurally disordered states. We divide the elastic energy into an elastic
part due to affine deformation and a defect part. The latter represents degree
of disorder and is nearly constant in plastic flow under cyclic straining.

frame in which the universe is smallest. Although we are not likely to be at
the centre of the universe, we must live in the preferred frame (if we are at
rest with respect to the cosmological expansion). We show that the preferred
topological frame must also be the comoving frame in a homogeneous and
isotropic cosmological spacetime. Some implications of topologically
identifying time are also discussed.

representation of the gauge group. If we propagate the particle along some
path, the parallel transport of the gauge connection acts on this
representation. The Lagrangian density of the gauge field depends on the
curvature of the connection which can be calculated from the holonomy around
(infinitesimal) loops. For Abelian symmetry groups, say G=U(1), there exists a
generalization, known as p-form electrodynamics, in which (p-1)-dimensional
charged objects can be propagated along p-surfaces and in which the Lagrangian
depends on a generalized curvature associated with (infinitesimal) closed
p-surfaces. In this article, we use Lie 2-groups and ideas from higher category
theory in order to formulate a discrete gauge theory which generalizes these
models at the level p=2 to possibly non-Abelian symmetry groups. An important
feature of our model is that it involves both parallel transports along paths
and generalized transports along surfaces with a non-trivial interplay of these
two types of variables. Our main result is the geometric picture, namely the
assignment of non-Abelian quantities to geometrical objects in a coordinate
free way. We construct the precise assignment of variables to the curves and
surfaces, the generalized local symmetries and gauge invariant actions and we
clarify which structures can be non-Abelian and which others are always
Abelian. A discrete version of connections on non-Abelian gerbes is a special
case of our construction. Even though the motivation sketched so far suggests
applications mainly in string theory, the model presented here is also related
to spin foam models of quantum gravity and may in addition provide some insight
into the role of centre monopoles and vortices in lattice QCD.

product of single integrals. This fact is deeply related to a cohomological
nature of our formulae. Our approach is also based on the deformation of
hyper-elliptic integrals and their main property -- deformed Riemann bilinear
relation. Jimbo and Miwa also suggested a nice conjecture which relates
solution of the qKZ on level -4 to any correlation function of the XXX model.

that we recently developed for systems of bosons and show that quantum states
of fermionic fields can be described, in the Heisenberg picture, as linear
combinations of randomly distributed paths that do not interfere between
themselves and obey classical Dirac equations. Every physical observable is
assigned a time-dependent value on each path in a way that respects the
anticommutative algebra between quantum operators and we observe that these
values on paths do not necessarily satisfy the usual algebraic relations
between classical observables. We use these pseudoclassical paths to define the
dynamics of quantum fluctuations in systems of fermions and show that, as we
found for systems of bosons, the dynamics of fluctuations of a wide class of
observables that we call ""collective"" observables can be approximately
described in terms of classical stochastic concepts. Finally, we apply this
formalism to describe the dynamics of local fluctuations of globally conserved
fermion numbers.

configuations such as solitons, instantons, and sphalerons. However, no direct
use has yet been made of the quite extensive literature on ``localized wave''
configurations developed by the engineering, optics, and mathematics
communities. In this article I will exhibit a particularly simple ``physical
wavelet'' -- it is a Lorentz covariant classical field configuration that lives
in physical Minkowski space. The field is everwhere finite and nonsingular, and
has quadratic falloff in both space and time. The total energy is finite, the
total action is zero, and the field configuration solves the wave equation.
These physical wavelets can be constructed for both complex and real scalar
fields, and can be extended to the Maxwell and Yang-Mills fields in a
straightforward manner. Since these wavelets are finite energy, they are
guaranteed to be classically present at finite temperature; since they are zero
action, they can contribute to the quantum mechanical path integral at zero
``cost''.

flat or spherical and the solution is identical to the space-like two brane or

bosonic string moving in antisymmetric and dilaton background fields. This
space-time geometry we shall call the stringy geometry. In particular, the
presence of the antisymmetric field leads to the space-time torsion, and the
presence of the dilaton field leads to the space-time nonmetricity. We
generalize the geometry of surfaces embedded in space-time to the case when
torsion and nonmetricity are present. We define the mean extrinsic curvature
for Minkowski signature and introduce the concept of mean torsion. Its
orthogonal projection defines the dual mean extrinsic curvature. In this
language, one field equation is just the equality of mean extrinsic curvature
and dual mean extrinsic curvature, which we call self-duality relation. In the
torsion and nonmetricity free case, the world-sheet is a minimal surface,
specified by the requirement that mean extrinsic curvature vanishes. Generally,
it is stringy self-dual (anti self-dual) surface. In the presence of the
dilaton field, which breaks conformal invariance, the conformal factor which
connects intrinsic and induced metrics, is determined as a function of the
dilaton field itself. We also derive the integration measure for the space-time
with stringy nonmetricity.

forms in a hybrid or a quark star. Moreover, we find that a huge amount of
energy, of the order of $10^{53}$ erg, can be released in the conversion from a
(metastable) hadronic star into a (stable) hybrid or quark star, if the
presence of a color superconducting phase is taken into account. Accordingly to
the scenario proposed in Astrophys.J.586(2003)1250, the energy released in this
conversion can power a Gamma Ray Burst. This mechanism can explain the recent
observations indicating a delay, of the order of days or years, between a few
Supernova explosions and the subsequent Gamma Ray Burst.

a line bunch. In fact, since a bunch with vertical extent can always be thought
of as a superposition of displaced charge lines, all the relevant physical
aspects of the problem are included in the study of that simple model. Our
generalization results in a physically meaningful and quantitative explanation

simulations of several balanced functions and the two constant functions of a

derive an evolution equation for the purity of general Gaussian states both in

initial squeezed state evolving in a squeezed thermal bath whose asymptotic

well-calibrated photometric surveys, such as DPOSS, 2MASS, and SDSS,
spectroscopic identification of important targets is no longer a simple issue.
In order to enhance the returns from a spectroscopic survey, candidate sources
are often preferentially selected to be of interest, such as brown dwarfs or
high redshift quasars. This approach, while useful for targeted projects, risks
missing new or unusual species. We have, as a result, taken the alternative
path of spectroscopically identifying interesting sources with the sole
criterion being that they are in low density areas of the g - r and r - i
color-space defined by the DPOSS survey. In this paper, we present three
peculiar broad absorption line quasars that were discovered during this
spectroscopic survey, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach. PSS
J0052+2405 is an Iron LoBAL quasar at a redshift z = 2.4512 with very broad
absorption from many species. PSS J0141+3334 is a reddened LoBAL quasar at z =
3.005 with no obvious emission lines. PSS J1537+1227 is a Iron LoBAL at a
redshift of z = 1.212 with strong narrow Mgii and Feii emission. Follow-up high
resolution spectroscopy of these three quasars promises to improve our
understanding of BAL quasars. The sensitivity of particular parameter spaces,
in this case a two-color space, to the redshift of these three sources is
dramatic, raising questions about traditional techniques of defining quasar
populations for statistical analysis.

compelling evidence that the hosts of quasars with M_V < -24 mag are virtually
all massive ellipticals, with basic properties indistinguishable from those
displayed by their quiescent counterparts. The masses of these spheroids are as
expected given the relationship between black hole and spheroid mass now
established for nearby galaxies, as is the growing prevalence of significant
disk components in the hosts of progressively fainter active nuclei. In fact,
from spectroscopic measurements of the velocity of the broad-line region in
quasars, it has now proved possible to obtain an independent dynamical estimate
of the masses of the black holes that power quasars. I summarize recent results
from this work, which can be used to demonstrate that the black hole-spheroid
mass ratio in quasars is the same as that found for quiescent galaxies, namely
M_bh = 0.0012 M_sph. These results offer the exciting prospect of using
observations of quasars and their hosts to extend the study of the black
hole-spheroid mass ratio out to very high redshifts (z > 2). Moreover, there is
now good evidence that certain ultraviolet quasar emission lines can provide
robust estimates of black hole masses from the observed optical spectra of
quasars out to z > 2, and perhaps even at z > 4. By combining such information
with deep, high-resolution infrared imaging of high-redshift quasar hosts on
8-m class telescopes, there is now a real prospect of clarifying the evolution
of the black hole spheroid connection over cosmological time scales.

  The ratios are larger than the isotopic ratios for carbon and oxygen
appropriate for ambient interstellar material. Since for both carbon and oxygen
the more abundant isotopomer is enhanced, selective isotopic photodissociation
plays the key role in the fractionation process for these directions. The
enhancement arises because the more abundant isotopomer has lines that are more
optically thick, resulting in more self shielding from dissociating radiation.
A simple argument involving the amount of self shielding [from N(12CO)] and the
strength of the ultraviolet radiation field premeating the gas (from the amount
of vibrationally excited H_2) shows that selective isotopic photodissociation
controls the fractionation seen in these two sight lines, as well as the sight

are examined to account for some peculiar properties of hypernovae as well as
peculiar abundance patterns of metal-poor stars. The explosion is supposed to
be driven by bipolar jets which are powered by accretion onto a central
remnant. We explore the features of the explosions with varying progenitors'
masses and jet properties. The outcomes are different from conventional
spherical models. (1) In the bipolar models, Fe-rich materials are ejected at
high velocities along the jet axis, while O-rich materials occupy the central
region whose density becomes very high as a consequence of continuous accretion
from the side. This configuration can explain some peculiar features in the
light curves and the nebular spectra of hypernovae. (2) Production of $^{56}$Ni
tends to be smaller than in spherical thermal bomb models. To account for a
large amount of $^{56}$Ni observed in hypernovae, the jets should be initiated
when the compact remnant mass is still smaller than $2-3\msun$, or the jets
should be very massive and slow. (3) Ejected isotopes are distributed as
follows in order of decreasing velocities: $^{64}$Zn, $^{59}$Co, $^{56}$Fe,
$^{44}$Ti, and $^{4}$He at the highest velocities, $^{55}$Mn, $^{52}$Cr,
$^{32}$S, and $^{28}$Si at the intermediate velocities, and $^{24}$Mg, $^{16}$O
at the lowest velocities. (4) The abundance ratios (Zn, Co)/Fe are enhanced
while the ratios (Mn, Cr)/Fe are suppressed. This can account for the abundance
pattern of extremely metal-poor stars. These agreements between the models and
observations suggest that hypernovae are driven by bipolar jets and have
significantly contributed to the early Galactic chemical evolution.

the spectrum of the supernova is remarkably similar to the type Ic `hypernova'

significant concentration around a central cD galaxy and morphological

systems in HI absorption. The ``high velocity'' system is the most prominent of
these; it is redshifted from systemic by about 150 km/s. In HI VLBI it is seen
towards both jets, but appears to be restricted to a shell 1 to 2 pc away from

the free-free absorption. WSRT spectroscopy shows 1667 and 1665 MHz OH main
line absorption over at least the full ~250 km/s velocity range seen in HI. In
the ``high velocity'' system, the profiles of the OH main lines and HI are
similar, which suggests co-location of molecular and atomic gas. The OH
satellite lines are also detected in the ``high velocity'' system: 1612 MHz in

mag beyond the turn-over magnitude of the GC luminosity function for each
galaxy. Specific frequencies (S_N values) of GCs were evaluated by comparing
the numbers of GCs found in our WFPC2 pointings with those in the Milky Way
which would be detected in the same metric area. The S_N values of spirals with
B/T <= 0.3 (i.e., spirals with a Hubble type later than about Sb) are
consistent with a value of S_N = 0.55 +- 0.25. We suggest that this population
of GCs represents a `universal', old halo population that is present around
each galaxy. Most galaxies in our sample have S_N values that are consistent
with a scenario in which GC systems are made up of (i) the aforementioned halo
population plus (ii) a population that is associated with bulges, which grows
linearly with the mass of the bulge. Such scenarios include the `merger
scenario' for the formation of elliptical galaxies as well as the `multi-phase
collapse' scenario, but it seems inconsistent with the `secular evolution'
scenario of Pfenniger & Norman (1990), in which bulges are formed from disc
stars by means of the redistribution of angular momentum through bar
instabilities and/or minor perturbations. However, there is one bulge-dominated
spiral galaxy in our sample (NGC 7814) with a low S_N value that is consistent
with those of the latest-type spirals. Thus, our results suggest that the
formation histories of galaxy bulges of early-type spirals can be significantly
different from one galaxy to another. (abridged)

Toolkit's Monitoring and Discovery Service (MDS), the European Data Grid
Relational Grid Monitoring Architecture (R-GMA), and Hawkeye, part of the

to number of users, number of resources, and amount of data collected. Our

different design goals. In the four sets of experiments we conducted to
evaluate the performance of the service components under different

as well as the need to have primary components at well connected sites due to
high load seen by all systems.

considered one of the most secure in quantum field theory in curved space-time.
Yet this prediction rests on two dubious assumptions: that ordinary physics may
be applied to vacuum fluctuations at energy scales increasing exponentially
without bound; and that quantum-gravitational effects may be neglected. Various
suggestions have been put forward to address these issues: that they might be
explained away by lessons from sonic black hole models; that the prediction is
indeed successfully reproduced by quantum gravity; that the success of the link
provided by the prediction between black holes and thermodynamics justifies the
prediction.
  This paper explains the nature of the difficulties, and reviews the proposals
that have been put forward to deal with them. None of the proposals put forward
can so far be considered to be really successful, and simple dimensional
arguments show that quantum-gravitational effects might well alter the
evaporation process outlined by Hawking. Thus a definitive theoretical
treatment will require an understanding of quantum gravity in at least some
regimes. Until then, no compelling theoretical case for or against radiation by
black holes is likely to be made.
  The possibility that non-radiating ""mini"" black holes exist should be taken
seriously; such holes could be part of the dark matter in the Universe.
Attempts to place observational limits on the number of ""mini"" black holes
(independent of the assumption that they radiate) would be most welcome.

solutions of the second, zeroth and infinite kinds, perfect-fluid solutions and
vacuum solutions of the first kind are treated. The kinematic self-similarity
vector is either parallel or orthogonal to the fluid flow in the perfect-fluid
and vacuum cases, while the `tilted' case, i.e., neither parallel nor
orthogonal case, is also treated in the dust case. In the parallel case, there
are no dust solutions of the second (except when the self-similarity index
$\alpha$ is 3/2), zeroth and infinite kinds, and in the orthogonal case, there
are no dust solutions of the second and infinite kinds. Except in these cases,
the governing equations can be integrated to give exact solutions. It is found
that the dust solutions in the tilted case belong to a subclass of the Lema{\^
i}tre-Tolman-Bondi family of solutions for the marginally bound case. The flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) solution is the only dust solution of the
second kind with $\alpha=3/2$ in the tilted and parallel cases and of the
zeroth kind in the orthogonal case. The flat, open and closed FRW solutions
with $p=-\mu/3$, where $p$ and $\mu$ are the pressure and energy density,
respectively, are the only perfect-fluid first-kind self-similar solutions in
the parallel case, while a new exact solution with $p=\mu$, which we call the
``singular stiff-fluid solution'', is the only such solution in the orthogonal
case. The Minkowski solution is the only vacuum first-kind self-similar

are matrix-multiplied in a specified order (usually dictated by a permutation

to a O(N) thermodynamic entropy characteristic of the lower dimensional theory,

the entropy coming from the bulk fields in one higher dimension with O(1)
contributions from the classical solution ensures that the subleading terms in
thermodynamic quantities are of the expected form. While the spin components of
the collective field transform properly under dilatational, translational and
rotational isometries of $AdS$, special conformal transformations mix fields of
different spins indicating a need for a nonlocal map between the two sets of

curves with formal coordinates. By computing the curvature of this line bundle,
we conclude that we actually need a fractional power of this line bundle so as
to obtain a flat connection after tensoring. In order to functorially extract
this fractional power, we need to construct a preferred section of the line
bundle.

make easier the analysis of the sensitivity of their solutions to initial

the values of the initial condition participate to the solution at all

of the k-space quantities using a method previously developed for the kinematic
dynamo problem (Nazarenko, 2003). Working with the $k$-space moments allows to
introduce new useful measures of intermittency such as the mean polarization
and the spectral flatness. Our study of the 2D turbulence shows that the energy
cascade is scale invariant and Gaussian whereas the enstrophy cascade is
intermittent. In 3D, we show that the statistics of turbulence wavepackets
deviates from gaussianity toward dominance of the plane polarizations. Such
turbulence is formed by ellipsoids in the $k$-space centered at its origin and
having one large, one neutral and one small axes with the velocity field
pointing parallel to the smallest axis.

in this work can even lead to a higher improved output yield when it is
combined with the hashing protocol, as compared with the combined algorithm
consisting of the Oxford and the hashing protocol.

  Machine and the Universal NOT gate","9 pages, 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The universal quantum cloning machine and the universal NOT gate acting on a
single qubit can be implemented very generally by slightly modifying the
protocol of quantum state teleportation. The experimental demonstration of the
1 to 2 cloning process according to the above scheme has been realized for a
qubit encoded in photon polarization.

important features of quantum computation, and which allows to design fast
algorithms for solving specific problems. In particular, we show that Deutsch's
problem can be trated within the S model of computation in the same way as
within quantum computation; also Grover's search problem of an unsorted
database finds a surprisingly fast solution. The correct understanding of these
results put into a new perspective the relationship between quantum and
classical computation.

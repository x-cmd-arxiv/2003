fluctuations of the WMAP group, who set the two adiabatic spectral indices

somewhat, e.g., from 0.76 of n_ad2 = n_ad1 models to 0.84 with a prior n_iso <

degeneration between the correlation component and the optical depth tau.

by a strong negative correlation, but then one needs a large tau to fit the TE

LCDM model. In particular, the quadrupole C_2 is reported to have a smaller
value than allowed by cosmic variance. This has been interpreted as a possible
indication of new physics. In this paper we re-analyse the WMAP data using the
2-point angular correlation and its higher-order moments. This method, which
requires a full covariance analysis, is more direct and provides better
sampling of the largest modes than the standard harmonic decomposition. We show
that the WMAP data is in good agreement (~ 30% probability) with a LCDM model
when the WMAP data is considered as a particular realization drawn from a set
of realistic LCDM simulations with the corresponding covariance. This is also
true for the higher-order moments, shown here up to 6th order, which are
consistent with the Gaussian hypothesis. The sky mask plays a major role in
assessing the significance of these agreements. We recover the best fit model
for the low-order multipoles based on the 2-point correlation with different
assumptions for the covariance. Assuming that the observations are a fair
sample of the true model, we find C_2 = 123 +/- 233, C_3= 217 +/- 241 and C_4 =
212 +/- 162 (in mu K^2). The errors increase by about a factor of 5 if we
assume the \lcdm model. If we exclude the Galactic plane |b|<30 from our
analysis, we recover very similar values within the errors (ie C_2=172, C_3=
89, C_4=129). This indicates that the Galactic plane is not responsible for the
lack of large-scale power in the WMAP data.

mapped by M giant star tracers detected in the complete Two Micron All-Sky

radius, but with a break in the density profile from stars in tidal tails. We
argue that much of the observed structure beyond the 224' core radius may be
unbound as the satellite undergoes catastrophic disruption. A striking, >150
deg trailing tidal tail extends from the Sgr center and arcs across the South
Galactic Hemisphere. A prominent leading debris arm extends from the Sgr center
northward of the Galactic plane to an ~40 kpc apoGalacticon, loops towards the
North Galactic Cap (NGC) and descends back towards the Galactic plane,
foreshortened and covering the NGC. The Sgr tails lie along a well-defined
orbital plane that shows little precession, which supports the notion of a
nearly spherical Galactic potential. The Sun lies near the path of leading Sgr
debris; thus, former Sgr stars may be near or in the solar neighborhood. The
number of M giants in the Sgr tails is >15% that within the King limiting
radius of the Sgr center. That several gigayear old M giants are so widespread
along the Sgr tidal arms not only places limits on the dynamical age of these
arms but poses a timing problem that bears on the recent binding energy of the
Sgr core and that is naturally explained by recent and catastrophic mass loss.
Sgr appears to contribute >75% of the high latitude, halo M giants; no evidence
for M giant tidal debris from the Magellanic Clouds is found. Generally good
correspondence is found between the M giant, all-sky map of the Sgr system and
all previously published detections of potential Sgr debris with the exception
of Sgr carbon stars -- which must be subluminous to resolve the discrepancy.

With the full Sloan Digital Sky Survey the statistical errors will be below 1
percent for the galaxy-galaxy correlations and significantly larger for
QSO-galaxy correlations. Thus accurate constraints on parameters of the galaxy
halo occupation distribution can be obtained from small scale measurements and
on the bias parameter from large scales. Since the lensing induced

galaxies, these measurements can provide the basis for interpreting galaxy
clustering measurements which measure the second and higher order moments.

Relativistic fine structure is considered through the Breit-Pauli R-matrix

treatment for total electron-ion recombination subsuming both radiative and
di-electronic recombination processes. Self-consistency is ensured by using an
identical wavefunction expansion for the inverse processes of photoionization
and photo-recombination. Radiation damping of resonances, important for H-like
and He-like core ions, is included. Compared to previous LS coupling results
without radiative decay of low-n (<= 10) resonances, the presents results show
significant reduction in O VI recombination rates at high temperatures. In
addition to the total rates, level-specific photoionization cross sections and
recombination rates are presented for all fine structure levels n (lSLJ) up to

cosmological perturbations in a universe containing photons, baryons,
neutrinos, cold dark matter, and a scalar quintessence field. By formulating
the evolution in terms of a differential equation involving a matrix acting on
a vector comprised of the perturbation variables, we can use the familiar
language of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. As the largest eigenvalue of the
evolution matrix is fourfold degenerate, it follows that there are four
dominant modes with non-diverging gravitational potential at early times,
corresponding to adiabatic, cold dark matter isocurvature, baryon isocurvature
and neutrino isocurvature perturbations. We conclude that quintessence does not
lead to an additional independent mode.

In an extensive series of numerical $N$-body simulations with a high spatial

quantify the diffusion of magnetic field lines which is attributed to the
presence of resistivity in ideal and non-ideal MHD codes. The method relies (1)
on integration of magnetic lines in between periodic boundaries, (2) on
measurements of the dispersion of magnetic field lines with the left and the
right periodic boundaries and (3) on a statistical analysis of shifts of a
large set of magnetic lines. The proposed method makes it possible to detect
topological evolution of magnetic field. We perform a series of resistive MHD
simulations of the Parker instability in uniformly rotating galactic disks. We
follow the topological evolution of the magnetic field evolving due to the
Parker instability and relate it to the ratio of total to uniform magnetic
field in galactic disks. We find that after the onset of the Parker
instability, the magnetic field becomes first tangled and later on it evolves
toward a uniform state due to the presence of resistivity. A similar effect of
a varying contribution of a turbulent magnetic field is observed in arms and
inter-arm regions of galaxies.

in the study of accreting black holes. The line is thought to result from the
reprocessing of external X-rays by the surface of the accretion disk. However,
as is observed in the solar corona, illumination by energetic particles may
also produce line emission. In principle, such a process may be uncorrelated
with the observed X-rays and could explain some of the unexpected variability
behavior of the Fe line. This paper compares predictions of iron K flux
generated by impacting electrons and protons to that from photoionization.
Non-thermal power-laws of electrons are considered as well as thermal
distributions of electrons and virialized protons. The electrons are thought to
originate in a magnetically dominated accretion disk corona, while the protons
are considered in the context of a two phase (hot/cold) accretion scenario. In
each case, the Fe K flux from particle impact is found to be < 1% of that
produced by photoionization by a hard X-ray power-law (normalized to the same
energy flux as the particles). Thus, the electrons or protons must strike the
disk with 100--10,000 times more energy flux than radiation for particle impact
to be a significant producer of Fe K flux. This situation is difficult to
reconcile with the observations of hard X-ray spectra, or the proposed particle
acceleration mechanisms in the accretion disk corona. Truncated accretion flows
must be externally illuminated by hard X-rays in order to produce the Fe line,
as proton impact is very inefficient in generating line emission. In contrast
to the Sun, our conclusion is that, with the possible exception for localized
regions around magnetic footpoints, particle impact will not be an important
contributor to the X-ray emission in accreting black holes.

found that the spin relaxation rate increases rapidly with the drift field,

When the electrons are injected with a high energy, a pronounced decrease is
observed in the spin relaxation length due to an initial increase in the spin
precession frequency. Hence, high-field or high-energy transport conditions may
not be desirable for spin-based devices.

energies become more favorable when short chain segments sequentially adjacent
to the contacting residues adopt native-like conformations. At a given
interaction strength, this scheme leads to folding rates that are
logarithmically well correlated with CO (correlation coefficient $r=0.914$) and
span more than 2.5 orders of magnitude, whereas folding rates of the
corresponding G\=o models with additive contact energies have much less
logarithmic correlation with CO and span only approximately one order of

cooperativity and linear chevron plots similar to that observed experimentally

increase by several orders of magnitude in a non-Arrhenius manner as a

ways dissimilar to that of a liquid. In particular, structural relaxation is
nearly exponential in time at each wave vector, indicating that the mode
coupling effects dominating liquid relaxation are comparatively weak within
this model. Relaxation properties of the model are instead well reproduced by
the simplest dynamical extension of a static Hartree approximation. This
approach is qualitatively accurate even for temperatures at which the mode
coupling approximation predicts loss of ergodicity. These results suggest that

Ru-1212Gd to magnetic field inhomogeneities when it is moved in the
superconducting magnet of the SQUID magnetometer during the measurements, we
suggest that the reported different behaviors can be the result of different
field profiles in the superconducting magnet and not of different
superconducting properties. In order to avoid the artifacts arising from moving
the sample in an inhomogeneous field, we did measurements on a stationary
Ru-1212Gd sample employing a home made SQUID magnetometer. The measured curves
showed none of the suspicious ``symptoms'' present in the curves measured with
a magnetometer employing sample movement (e.g. no reversal of the features
observed in the superconducting state of Ru-1212Gd by a field reversal) and if
verified by measurements on stationary samples by other groups a universal
behavior in the superconducting state of Ru-1212Gd can be revealed by the SQUID

has propagated through a noisy reverberant channel. This is done by blindly
rescaling the cepstral time series by a non-linear function, with the form of
this scale function being determined by previously encountered cepstra from
that channel. The rescaled form of the time series is an invariant property of
it in the following sense: it is unaffected if the time series is transformed
by any time-independent invertible distortion. Because a linear channel with
stationary noise and impulse response transforms cepstra in this way, the new
technique can be used to remove the channel dependence of a cepstral time
series. In experiments, the method achieved greater channel-independence than
cepstral mean normalization, and it was comparable to the combination of
cepstral mean normalization and spectral subtraction, despite the fact that no
measurements of channel noise or reverberations were required (unlike spectral
subtraction).

per day originated by $\nu_\mu$ CC interactions in the rock. The LVD total mass
is $\sim2 kt$. This allows to get 30 more CNGS events per day as internal $(NC

statistical error can be reached in 7 days. Taking into account the time

a negligible level, of the order of 1.5 events per day.

  Data: Evidence for Rieger-Type Periodicities and their Interpretation as
  R-Mode Oscillations","15 pages, 5 figures",,,,"hep-ph",,"  Previous power-spectrum analyses of the Homestake and GALLEX-GNO
radiochemical solar neutrino data have shown evidence of the effects of solar
rotation and also indications of oscillations with two periods that are well
known in solar physics: one at about 154 days period (the Rieger periodicity)
and another at about 52 days period. We here analyze both data sets, taken
together, to test the hypothesis that the above periodicities, and a related
periodicity with a period of about 77 days, are due to r-mode oscillations with
spherical harmonic indices l = 3 and m = 1, 2, and 3. These would have
frequencies nuR/6, nuR/3, and nuR/2, where nuR is the sidereal rotation rate
where the waves are excited. We first form a statistic that combines
information from power spectra formed from Homestake and GALLEX-GNO data. From
this statistic, we form another statistic to search for a sidereal rotation
frequency that leads simultaneously to four peaks in the Homestake-GALLEX-GNO
spectrum: one corresponding to the synodic rotation frequency nuR - 1, and the
other three corresponding to the l = 3 r-modes. We find that, in the range 0 to
20 cycles per year, there is one notable peak at 13.88 cycles per year; This
falls in the rotation frequency range of the radiative zone. The corresponding
synodic rotation period is 28.4 days, and the corresponding r-mode periods are
157, 78, and 52 days. By applying the shuffle test to the data, we find that
the probability of obtaining by chance a peak this big or bigger in the
rotation-frequency band of the radiative-zone is less than 0.1%. The modulation
of the neutrino flux is attributed to the poloidal motion of a magnetic
structure that moves in and out of the narrow beam of neutrinos that originate
in the solar core and are detected on Earth.

production. This computation is relevant for the theoretical analysis of the
direct detection of dark matter in current experiments. We consider first the
supergravity scenario with universal soft terms and GUT scale. In this scenario
the charge and colour breaking constraints turn out to be quite important, and
$\tan\beta\lsim 20$ is forbidden. Larger values of $\tan\beta$ can also be
forbidden, depending on the value of the trilinear parameter $A$. Finally, we
study supergravity scenarios with an intermediate scale, and also with
non-universal scalar and gaugino masses where the cross section can be very
large.

a key problem of many fundamental and applied sciences. Information processing
by computation with attractors (steady states, limit cycles and strange
attractors) has been a subject of many publications. In this paper we discuss a
new direction in information dynamics based on neurophysiological experiments
that can be applied for the explanation and prediction of many phenomena in
living biological systems and for the design of new paradigms in neural
computation. This new concept is the Winnerless Competition (WLC) principle.
The main point of this principle is the transformation of the incoming identity
or spatial inputs into identity-temporal output based on the intrinsic
switching dynamics of the neural system. In the presence of stimuli the
sequence of the switching, whose geometrical image in the phase space is a
heteroclinic contour, uniquely depends on the incoming information. The key
problem in the realization of the WLC principle is the robustness against noise
and, simultaneously, the sensitivity of the switching to the incoming input. In
this paper we prove two theorems about the stability of the sequential
switching and give several examples of WLC networks that illustrate the
coexistence of sensitivity and robustness.

diffusive, so that the oscillators are almost uncoupled, while there is an

low temperatures of the disordered medium in order to keep the full contrast of
the CBS interference. This criterion is usually achieved with standard laser
cooling techniques. Secondly, a non trivial internal atomic structure leads to
a dramatic decrease of the CBS contrast. Experiments with Rubidium atoms (with
a non trivial internal structure) and with Strontium (with the simplest
possible internal structure) show this behaviour and confirm theoretical

the black hole candidate (BHC) transient XTE J1650-500 at the end of its first,
and currently only, outburst. By monitoring the source at low luminosities over
several months, we found 6 bright ~100 second X-ray flares and long time scale
oscillations of the X-ray flux. The oscillations are aperiodic with a
characteristic time scale of 14.2 days and an order of magnitude variation in
the 2.8-20 keV flux. The oscillations may be related to optical
""mini-outbursts"" that have been observed at the ends of outbursts for other
short orbital period BHC transients. The X-ray flares have durations between 62
and 215 seconds and peak fluxes that are 5-24 times higher than the persistent
flux. The flares have non-thermal energy spectra and occur when the persistent
luminosity is near 3E34 (d/4 kpc)^2 erg/s (2.8-20 keV). The rise time for the
brightest flare demonstrates that physical models for BHC systems must be able
to account for the situation where the X-ray flux increases by a factor of up
to 24 on a time scale of seconds. We discuss the flares in the context of
observations and theory of Galactic BHCs and compare the flares to those
detected from Sgr A*, the super-massive black hole at the Galactic center. We
also compare the flares to X-ray bursts that are seen in neutron star systems.
While some of the flare light curves are similar to those of neutron star
bursts, the flares have non-thermal energy spectra in contrast to the blackbody
spectra exhibited in bursts. This indicates that X-ray bursts should not be
taken as evidence that a given system contains a neutron star unless the
presence of a blackbody component in the burst spectrum can be demonstrated.

X-rays (2-8 kev) to search for the possible presence of an obscured AGN. In
every case, a hard X-ray source is detected in the nuclear region. If we divide
the sample according to the optical/IR spectroscopic classification (starburst
vs. AGN), we find that the 5 ``starburst'' ULIRGs have hard X-ray luminosities
about an order-of-magnitude smaller than the 3 ``AGN'' ULIRGs. NGC 6240 has an
anomalously high hard X-ray luminosity compared to the ``starburst'' ULIRGs.
The Fe Kalpha line is convincingly detected in only two ULIRGs. The weakness of
the Fe-K emission in these ULIRGs generally suggests that the hard X-ray
spectrum is not dominated by reflection from high N_H neutral material. The
hard X-ray continuum flux ranges from a few X 10^3 to a few X 10^-5 of the
far-IR flux, similar to values in pure starbursts, and several
orders-of-magnitude smaller than in Compton-thin AGN. The upper limits on the
ratio of the Fe Kalpha to far-IR flux are below the values measured in
Compton-thick type 2 Seyfert galaxies. While very large column densities of
molecular gas are observed in the nuclei of these galaxies, we find no evidence
that the observed X-ray sources are obscured by Compton-thick material. Thus,
our new hard X-ray data do not provide direct evidence that powerful ``buried

example, the hard movable partial reflector. These processes serve as a
simplified models of infection in a medium with a history-dependent
susceptibility, and for spreading in systems with an infinite number of
absorbing configurations. The memory may take the form of a history-dependent
step length, or be the result of a partial reflector whose position marks the
maximum distance the walker has ventured from the origin. In each case, a
process with memory is rendered Markovian by a suitable expansion of the state
space. Asymptotic analysis of the probability generating function shows that,
for large t, the survival probability decays as S(t) \sim t^{-delta}, where
\delta varies with the parameters of the model. We report new results for a
hard partial reflector, i.e., one that moves forward only when the walker does.
When the walker tries to jump to the site R occupied by the reflector, it is
reflected back with probability r, and stays at R with probability 1-r; only in
the latter case does the reflector move (R \to R+1). For this model, delta =
1/2(1-r), and becomes arbitrarily large as r approaches 1. This prediction is
confirmed via iteration of the transfer matrix, which also reveals
slowly-decaying corrections to scaling.

considered and its dynamics is analyzed numerically. The dynamical trap region
is assumed to be located near the x-axis where the velocity v of the system
becomes sufficiently low. The meaning of this assumption is discussed. The
observed phase transition is caused by the asymmetry in the residence time
distribution in the vicinity of zero value velocity. This asymmetry is due to a
cooperative effect of the random Langevin force in the trap region and the
regular force not changing the direction of action when crossing the trap

by (0,2) linear sigma models are believed to be stable, suggesting a remarkable
cancellation among the instanton effects in these theories. Here, we show that
this cancellation follows directly from a residue theorem, whose proof relies
only upon the right-moving world-sheet supersymmetries and suitable compactness
properties of the (0,2) linear sigma model. Our residue theorem also extends to
a new class of ""half-linear"" sigma models. Using these half-linear models, we
show that heterotic compactifications on the quintic hypersurface in CP^4 for
which the gauge bundle pulls back from a bundle on CP^4 are stable. Finally, we
apply similar ideas to compute the superpotential contributions from families
of membrane instantons in M-theory compactifications on manifolds of G_2

compensated by a parametric drive, is proposed. It is a combination of the
well-known parametrically driven nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger (NLS) and complex
cubic Ginzburg-Landau equations, and has various physical applications (in
particular, to optical systems). For the case when the zero background is
stable, we elaborate an analytical approximation for solitary-pulse (SP)
states. The analytical results are found to be in good agreement with numerical
findings. Unlike the driven NLS equation, in the present model SPs feature a
nontrivial phase structure. Combining the analytical and numerical methods, we
identify a stability region for the SP solutions in the model's parameter
space. Generally, the increase of the diffusion and nonlinear-loss parameters,
which differ the present model from its driven-NLS counterpart, lead to
shrinkage of the stability domain. At one border of the stability region, the
SP is destabilized by the Hopf bifurcation, which converts it into a localized
breather. Subsequent period doublings make internal vibrations of the breather
chaotic. In the case when the zero background is unstable, hence SPs are
irrelevant, we construct stationary periodic solutions, for which a very
accurate analytical approximation is developed too. Stability of the periodic
waves is tested by direct simulations.

"quant-ph/0304090","Ralf Schutzhold","R. Sch\""utzhold and W. G. Unruh","Hidden symmetry detection on a quantum computer","8 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The fastest quantum algorithms (for the solution of classical computational
tasks) known so far are basically variations of the hidden subgroup problem
with {$f(U[x])=f(x)$}. Following a discussion regarding which tasks might be
solved efficiently by quantum computers, it will be demonstrated by means of a
simple example, that the detection of more general hidden (two-point)
symmetries {$V\{f(x),f(U[x])\}=0$} by a quantum algorithm can also admit an
exponential speed-up. E.g., one member of this class of symmetries
{$V\{f(x),f(U[x])\}=0$} is discrete self-similarity (or discrete scale
invariance). PACS: 03.67.Lx, 89.70.+c.

state, and uses it to study the relationship between topological and quantum
entanglement. It is fundamental to view topological entanglements such as
braids as entanglement operators and to associate to them unitary operators
that are capable of creating quantum entanglement. The entanglement criterion
is used to explore this connection. The paper discusses non-locality in the
light of this criterion.

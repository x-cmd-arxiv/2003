combining observations of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and
high-redshift quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use a
semi-analytic model for reionization (Chiu and Ostriker 2000) that takes into
account a number of important physical processes both within collapsing halos
and in the intergalactic medium. Assuming that the efficiency of producing UV
photons per baryon is constant, we derive a constraint of the form sigma_8
Omega_0^0.5~0.33 in a flat, Lambda-dominated universe with h=0.72, n=0.99, and
Omega_b h^2=0.024. However, the calculated optical depth to electron scattering
of tau_es~0.06 is well below the value found by WMAP of 0.17+/-(0.04~0.07)
(Spergel et al 2003). Since the WMAP constraints on tau_es are somewhat
degenerate with the value of the spectral index n, we then permit the
primordial spectral index n to float and fix Omega_0 h^2=0.14, while
normalizing the power spectrum using WMAP. In addition, we allow the
UV-efficiency to have time-dependence. Combining the WMAP constraints with the
quasar transmission data, our analysis then favors a model with
tau_es=0.11^{+0.02}_{-0.03}, n=0.96^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, implying
sigma_8=0.83^{+0.03}_{-0.05} (95% confidence), and an effective UV-efficiency
that was at least ~10x greater at z >> 6. These results indicate that the
quasar and WMAP observations are consistent. If future observations confirm an
optical depth to electron scattering tau_es~0.1, then it would appear that no
more ""exotic"" sources of UV-photons, such as mini-quasars or AGNs, are
necessary; but our analysis indicates that a determination of tau_es>~0.17
would require a more radical solution.

very luminous galaxies that are largely hidden at optical wavelengths (because
of interstellar dust grains); this energy now forms part of the cosmic
background radiation at wavelengths near 1mm. These submillimetre (submm)
galaxies were resolved from the background in 1997 but have been difficult to
identify and study due to the poor spatial resolution of submm instruments.
This has impeded the determination of their distances (or redshifts, z), a
crucial element in understanding their nature and evolution. Here we report
spectroscopic redshifts for ten representative submm galaxies that we
identified reliably using high resolution radio observations. The median
redshift for our sample is 2.4, with a quartile range of z = 1.9-2.8. The submm
population therefore coexists with the peak activity of quasars, which are
thought to be massive black holes in the process of accreting matter,
suggesting a close relationship between the growth of massive black holes and
luminous dusty galaxies. The space density of submm galaxies at z>2 is about
1000 times greater than that of similarly luminous galaxies in the present-day
Universe, so they represent an important component of star formation at high
redshifts.

Schroedinger non-relativistic approximation. This model is based on two new
mathematical concepts: a complex analytical mechanics in Minplus complex
analysis and a periodical non random process which gives a complex Ito formula.
  This model naturally generates a concept of spin or isospin and the
Heisenberg inequalities, and leads to the Schroedinger equation using a
generalization of the least action principle adapted to the trajectories of
this type.

introduced the Lorentz-covariant world with E = mc^{2}. Feynman observed that
fast-moving hadrons consist of partons which act incoherently with external
signals. If quarks and partons are the same entities observed in different
Lorentz frames, the question then is why partons are incoherent while quarks
are coherent. This is the most puzzling question Feynman left for us to solve.
In this report, we discuss Wigner's role in settling this question. Einstein's
E = mc^{2}, which takes the form E = \sqrt{m^{2} + p^{2}}, unifies the
energy-momentum relations for massive and massless particles, but it does not
take into account internal space-time structure of relativistic particles. It
is pointed out Wigner's 1939 paper on the inhomogeneous Lorentz group defines
particle spin and gauge degrees of freedom in the Lorentz-covariant world.
Within the Wigner framework, it is shown possible to construct the internal
space-time structure for hadrons in the quark model. It is then shown that the
quark model and the parton model are two different manifestations of the same
covariant entity. It is shown therefore that the lack of coherence in Feynman's
parton picture is an effect of the Lorentz covariance.

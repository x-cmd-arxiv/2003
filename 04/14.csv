New section and figures added","Astron.Astrophys.412:35-44,2003","10.1051/0004-6361:20031425",,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  Precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background by WMAP are
believed to have established a flat $\Lambda$-dominated universe, seeded by
nearly scale-invariant adiabatic primordial fluctuations. However by relaxing
the hypothesis that the fluctuation spectrum can be described by a single power
law, we demonstrate that an Einstein-de Sitter universe with {\em zero}
cosmological constant can fit the data as well as the best concordance model.
Moreover unlike a $\Lambda$-dominated universe, such an universe has no strong
integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, so is in better agreement with the low
quadrupole seen by WMAP. The main problem is that the Hubble constant is
required to be rather low: $H_0 \simeq 46$ km/s/Mpc; we discuss whether this
can be consistent with observations. Furthermore for universes consisting only
of baryons and cold dark matter, the amplitude of matter fluctuations on
cluster scales is too high, a problem which seems generic. However, an
additional small contribution ($\Omega_X \sim 0.1$) of matter which does not
cluster on small scales, e.g. relic neutrinos with mass of order eV or a
`quintessence' with $w \sim 0$, can alleviate this problem. Such models provide
a satisfying description of the power spectrum derived from the 2dF galaxy
redshift survey and from observations of the Ly-$\alpha$ forest. We conclude
that Einstein-de Sitter models can indeed accommodate all data on the large
scale structure of the Universe, hence the Hubble diagram of distant Type Ia
supernovae remains the only {\em direct} evidence for a non-zero cosmological
constant.

system are performed by solving the Euler equations with radiative transfer. In
the present study, the specific heat ratio is assumed to be constant while
radiative cooling effect is included as a non-adiabatic process. The cooling
effect of the disc is considered by discharging energy in the vertical
directions from the top and bottom surfaces of the disc. We use the
flux-limited diffusion approximation to calculate the radiative heat flux
values. Our calculations show that a disc structure appears and the spiral
shocks are formed on the disc. These features are similar to that observed in
the case of an adiabatic gas with a lower specific heat ratio, $\gamma=1.01$.
It is found that when radiative cooling effect is accounted for, the mass of
the disc becomes larger than that assuming $\gamma=5/3$, and smaller than that
assuming $\gamma=1.01$. It is concluded that employing an adiabatic gas with a
lower specific heat ratio is almost a valid assumption for simulating accretion
disc with radiative cooling effect.

massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass
densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type
galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar
populations similar to normal early-types. The hosts of high- luminosity AGN
have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially
located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at
least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high- luminosity AGN have
strong H$\delta$ absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they
experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined
the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We
conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between

times from 1997 to 2000. From July 6 1999 to August 17 1999, the source was
also simultaneously pointed by COMPTEL on-board of the satellite CGRO.
Centaurus A has a complex spectrum with multiple extended components and a
strongly absorbed (N_H\sim 10^{23}$ cm${-2}) nucleus well fitted by a power law
(\Gamma \sim 1.8) which bends at high energies. When the BeppoSAX and COMPTEL
observations are combined together, an exponential cutoff with e-folding energy
\sim 1000 keV gives an adequate description of the spectral steepening. A
complex feature in emission at 6-7 keV is resolved into two Fe components, one
narrow cold line and an ionized line centred at 6.8 keV. Significant variations
have been observed in the iron feature, with the less prominent ionized line
seemingly being the only one responsible for them: its variations do not appear
to correlate with the strength of the continuum. The high energy cutoff and the
Fe feature suggest the presence of an accretion flow in the Centaurus A
nucleus. However the absence of a significant reflection, the narrowness of the
cold line as well as the lack of correlation between the continuum and 6.8 keV
line variations disfavour a standard cold/ionized thin disk (at least in the
inner regions). A more plausible configuration might be a hot thick optically
thin accretion flow surrounded by material with different opacities.
  Finally, we note that high energy break observed by BeppoSAX and COMPTEL
could be also reasonably explained by Inverse Compton radiation from a jet. If
this is the case, a structured jet with outer slow layers surrounding a beamed
inner region is necessary to explain the strong Fe feature observed by
BeppoSAX.

strongest total field is found in the optical arms, but mainly irregular. The
large-scale regular field is best explained by some kind of dynamo action. Only
a few galaxies show a dominant axisymmetric field pattern, most field
structures seem to be a superposition of different dynamo modes or rather

detect thirty-six sources with S/N>3 (corresponding to a flux of 16 mJy),

heavier than helium), the formation of stars with masses 100 times that of the

formed before a minimum level of metal enrichment had been reached. The value
of this minimum level is very uncertain, but is likely to be between 10^{-6}

provides a pathway for cooling the gas that leads to fragmentation of the

analytically the critical singularity near the phase transition in the
anti-ferroelectric regime, where the essential singularity similar to the
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition appears. We discuss the connection of the
six-vertex model to the conformal field theory with c=1. We also introduce
various exactly solvable models defined on two-dimensional lattices such as the
chiral Potts model and the IRF models. We show that the six-vertex model has
rich mathematical structures such as the quantum groups and the braid group.
  The graphical approach is emphasized in this review. We explain the meaning
of the Yang-Baxter equation by its diagram. Furthermore, we can understand the
defining relation of the algebraic Bethe ansatz by the graphical
representation. We can thus easily translate formulas of the algebraic Bethe
ansatz into those of the statistical models. As an illustration, we show
explicitly how we can derive Baxter's expressions from those of the algebraic
Bethe ansatz.

bialgebra. In addition, the Poisson group as a variety is an affine space, and
the Lie bialgebra as a Lie algebra is graded. Forgetting these last details,
the second pair is of the same type.
  When the Hopf algebra H we start from is already of geometric type the result
involves Poisson duality: the first Lie bialgebra associated to H = F[G] is g^*
(with g := Lie(G)), and the first Poisson group H = U(g) is of type G^*, i.e.
it has g as cotangent Lie bialgebra.

want to restrict the range of possible unfoldings to include only those which
share the same symmetries as the original RFDE, and so our previous results do
not immediately apply. In this paper, we show that with appropriate
projections, our previous results on versal unfoldings of linear RFDEs can be
adapted to the case of linear equivariant RFDEs. We illustrate our theory by
studying the linear equivariant unfoldings at double Hopf bifurcation points in

solitons in a fiber grating are presented. Various outcomes of the collision
are identified, the most interesting one being merger of the solitons into a
single zero-velocity pulse, which suggests a way to create pulses of ``standing
light"". The merger occurs with the solitons whose energy takes values between
0.15 and 0.35 of the limit value, while their velocity is limited by about 0.2
of the limit light velocity in the fiber. If the energy is larger, another
noteworthy outcome is acceleration of the solitons as a result of the
collision. In the case of mutual passage of the solitons, inelasticity of the
collision is quantified by the energy-loss share. Past the soliton's stability
limit, the collision results in strong deformation and subsequent destruction
of the solitons. Simulations of multiple collisions of two solitons in a
fiber-loop configuration are performed too. In this case, the maximum velocity
admitting the merger increases to about 0.4 of the limit velocity. Influence of
an attractive local defect on the collision is also studied, with a conclusion
that the defect does not alter the overall picture, although it traps a
small-amplitude pulse. Related effects in single-soliton dynamics are
considered too, such as transformation of an input sech signal into a gap
soliton (which is quantified by the share of lost energy), and the rate of
decay of a quiescent gap soliton in a finite fiber grating, due to energy
leakage through loose edges.

nuclei in two regions: the 50$<$Z$\le$66, 82$<$N$\le$104 region, and the
66$<$Z$<$82, 82$<$N$\le$104 region. Using the $N_pN_n$ scheme, we obtain
compact trajectories for the ground band as well as quasi-$\beta$ and
quasi-$\gamma$ bands.
  This suggests that the $N_pN_n$ scheme is useful even if one extends it to
non-yrast levels, and thus can serve as a general tool to disclose new types of
structural evolution for higher excitations, besides the yrast states which
have been investigated extensively. It is highlighted that deformations in
non-yrast quasibands of nuclei with $Z \sim 80$ and $N \sim 104$ are often very
different from those in the ground bands.

partly connected to the even number of identical particles. It is also noticed
that the $P(I_{max})$'s of bosons with spin $l$ do not follow the 1/N ($N=l+1$,

mechanism. Since the perturbation due to the electric field of the (target)
nucleus is exactly known, firm conclusions can be drawn from such measurements.
Electromagnetic matrixelements and astrophysical S-factors for radiative
capture processes can be extracted from experiments. We describe the basic
elements of the theory of nonrelativistic and relativistic electromagnetic
excitation with heavy ions. This is contrasted to electromagnetic excitation
with leptons (electrons), with their small electric charge and the absence of
strong interactions. We discuss various approaches to the study of higher order
electromagnetic effects and how these effects depend on the basic parameters of
the experiment. The dissociation of neutron halo nuclei is studied in a zero
range model using analytical methods. We also review ways how to treat nuclear
interactions, show their characteristics and how to avoid them (as far as
possible). We review the experimental results from a theoretical point of view.
Of special interest for nuclear structure physics is the appearence of low
lying electric dipole strength in neutron rich nuclei. Applications of Coulomb
dissociation to some selected radiative capture reactions relevant for nuclear
astrophysics are discussed. The Coulomb dissociation of 8B is relevant for the
solar neutrino problem. The potential of the method especially for future
investigations of (medium) heavy exotic nuclei for nuclear structure and
astrophysics is explored. We conclude that the Coulomb dissociation mechanism
is theoretically well understood, the potential difficulties are identified and
can be taken care of. Many interesting experiments have been done in this field
and many more are expected in the future.

phenotypal model, and it is asked in particular where the information
processing mechanism of that cosmological sort of selection could actually be
found. It is argued that massive black holes in the centres of galaxies may
play this important role. Some consequences on black holes in general are
discussed then pointing to the necessity to actually revisit the concepts of
virtual and actual black holes also.

Heisenberg models shows the emergence of universal scaling behavior at quantum
phase transitions. Entanglement is thus controlled by conformal symmetry. Away
from the critical point, entanglement gets saturated by a mass scale. Results
borrowed from conformal field theory imply irreversibility of entanglement loss
along renormalization group trajectories. Entanglement does not saturate in
higher dimensions which appears to limit the success of the density matrix
renormalization group technique. A possible connection between majorization and
renormalization group irreversibility emerges from our numerical analysis.

of mutually exclusive quantum states with definite probabilities through
decoherence. Its study is based on a theory of decoherence resulting from the
projection method in the quantum theory of irreversible processes, which is
general enough for giving reliable predictions. This approach leads to a
definition (or redefinition) of the coupling with the environment involving
only fluctuations. The range of application of perturbation calculus is then
wide, resulting in a rather general master equation.
  Two distinct cases of decoherence are then found: (i) A ``degenerate'' case
(already encountered with solvable models) where decoherence amounts
essentially to approximate diagonalization; (ii) A general case where the
einselected states are essentially classical. They are mixed states. Their
density operators are proportional to microlocal projection operators (or
``quasi projectors'') which were previously introduced in the quantum
expression of classical properties.
  It is found at various places that the main limitation in our understanding
of decoherence is the lack of a systematic method for constructing collective
observables.

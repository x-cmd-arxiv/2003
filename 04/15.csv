emanate from the central region (the `core') of radio loud active galaxies.
  In the most powerful of them, these jets terminate in the `hotspots', compact
high brightness regions, where the jet flow collides with the intergalactic
medium (IGM). Although it has long been established that in their inner
($\sim$parsec) regions these jet flows are relativistic, it is still not clear
if they remain so at their largest (hundreds of kiloparsec) scales. We argue
that the X-ray, optical and radio data of the hotspots, despite their
at-first-sight disparate properties, can be unified in a scheme involving a
relativistic flow upstream of the hotspot that decelerates to the
sub-relativistic speed of its inferred advance through the IGM and viewed at
different angles to its direction of motion. This scheme, besides providing an
account of the hotspot spectral properties with jet orientation, it also
suggests that the large-scale jets remain relativistic all the way to the
hotspots.

distributions of galaxy luminosities. The most extreme example has an X-ray
luminosity similar to that of the Virgo cluster but has a very low richness,
with only one galaxy brighter than L*, compared with six in Virgo. That one
galaxy, however, is optically more luminous than any galaxy in Virgo and has an
optical luminosity as bright as many of the central cD galaxies in rich Abell
clusters. The characteristic feature of the fossil groups we study is that most
of the light arises from one dominant, central galaxy. We define a fossil
system and, based on this definition, construct a small X-ray selected,
flux-limited sample of fossil groups with well known selection criteria. We
confirm that these systems are indeed groups of galaxies, but dominated by one
central luminous giant elliptical galaxy and with few, or no, L* galaxies. We
find that fossil systems represent 8%-20% of all systems of the same X-ray
luminosity. Fossil groups are at least as numerous as all poor and rich
clusters combined, and are thus a possible site for the formation of luminous
central cluster galaxies before infall into clusters occurs. The fossil systems
in our sample have significantly higher X-ray luminosities than normal groups
of similar total optical luminosities (or similar X-ray temperature, where the
latter can be measured). These enhanced X-ray luminosities may be due to
relatively cool gas in the innermost regions or due to a low central gas
entropy. We interpret fossil groups as old, undisturbed systems which have
avoided infall into clusters, but where galaxy merging of most of the L*
galaxies has occurred. An early formation epoch, before that of most groups,
could explain low central gas entropies and high X-ray luminosities.

complex velocity structure with evidence for bow-shock structures as well as
prompt entrainment and shock heating of ambient molecular gas. Individual knots
within HH 38 show distinct double peaked velocity stucture, consistent with
that expected from spatially unresolved bow shocks. A portion of the HH 47A bow
shock is resolved in our measurements, and the kinematics of the H2 trace
closely that found for H-alpha emission. The evidence indicates that the
preshock medium for HH 47A that formed in the wake of a previous ejection
contains molecular clumps. The HH 46CjetA feature in the HH 46/47 counterflow
is suggestive of a bow shock emerging from near the base of the flow, with H2
emission arising from ambient cloud material excited in the oblique flanks of
the bow shock. HH 46F is situated downstream at the boundary between an ovoid
cavity and the ambient could material, and represents either entrainment by a
stellar wind that fills the cavity or entrainment in the far wing of a giant
bow shock. For HH 120, the H2 velocity results also corroborate those found
from atomic emission, and there is substantial evidence that the preshock
medium is inhomogeneous, producing clumps of H2 emission on the wings of a bow
shock that has an apex at HH 120A.

  In this paper, we tackle the problem of deriving the properties of a
marginally resolved object from its optical visibilities. We show that they
depend on the moments of flux distribution of the object: centre, mean angular
size, asymmetry, and curtosis. We also point out that the visibility amplitude
is a second-order phenomenon, whereas the phase is a combination of a
first-order term, giving the location of the photocentre, and a third-order
term, more difficult to detect than the visibility amplitude, giving an
asymmetry coefficient of the object. We then demonstrate that optical
visibilities are not a good model constraint while the object stays marginally
resolved, unless observations are carried out at different wavelengths.
Finally, we show an application of this formalism to circumstellar discs.

sensitive to transient events on timescales of 0.125 s to a few minutes, with a
typical zenith flux density detection threshold of approximately 27 kJy. During
18 months of around-the-clock observing with three geographically separated
instruments, we detected a total of 4,318,486 radio bursts. 99.9% of these
events were rejected as locally generated interference, determined by requiring
the simultaneous observation of an event at all three sites for it to be
identified as having an astronomical origin. The remaining 3,898 events have
been found to be associated with 99 solar radio bursts. These results
demonstrate the remarkably effective RFI rejection achieved by a coincidence
technique using precision timing (such as GPS clocks) at geographically

correction which confirms the flaring behaviour observed in previous optical

outer two peaks are associated with the accretion disc around the compact
object. The main aim of this paper is to constrain the origin of the central
peak, also called ``central spike''. We find that the central spike contributes
to the flare spectra indicating that its origin is probably the compact object.
We also detect that the central spike moves with orbital phase following an
S-wave pattern. The radial velocity semiamplitude of the S-wave is ~10 km/s
indicating that its origin is near the centre of mass of the system, which in
this case lies very close to the white dwarf. Our resolution is higher than
that of previous data which allows us to resolve structure in the central peak
of the line. The central spike in three of the HeI lines shows another peak
blueshifted with respect to the main peak. We propose that one of the peaks is
a neutral helium forbidden transition excited in a high electron density
region. This forbidden transition is associated with the permitted one (the
stronger peak in two of the lines). The presence of a high electron density
region again favours the white dwarf as their origin.

dispersions and line shapes in UGCA 292, GR8, and DDO 210 show that these three

trend between the incidence of the low-dispersion (colder) phase and the star
formation rate in five dwarf galaxies. The colder HI phase may be a necessary
ingredient for star formation, but it is clearly not sufficient. However, there
is a global trend between the star formation rate of a galaxy and the incidence
of asymmetric HI profiles. This trend probably reflects kinetic energy input
from young massive stars. Numerical simulations show that the effects of
rotational broadening (finite angular resolution) are minimal for these
galaxies. Simulations are also used to estimate the errors in the column

Lbul and BH masses are tightly correlated, and if we consider only those
galaxies with secure BH mass measurement and accurate Lbul (27 objects), the
spread of MBH-Lbul is similar to MBH-sigma, where sigma is the effective
stellar velocity dispersion. We find an intrinsic rms scatter of ~0.3 dex in
log MBH. By combining the bulge effective radii R_e measured in our analysis
with sigma, we find a tight linear correlation (rms ~ 0.25 dex) between MBH and
the virial bulge mass (propto R_e sigma^2), with <MBH/Mbul> ~ 0.002. A partial
correlation analysis shows that MBH depends on both sigma and R_e, and that
both variables are necessary to drive the correlations between MBH and other
bulge properties.

In particular we study the effects of drift in models of long-period variables,
meaning that the dust is allowed to move relative to the gas (drift models). In
addition we investigate the importance of the degree of variability of the wind
structures. The wind model contains separate conservation laws for each of the
three components of gas, dust and the radiation field. We use two different
representations for the gas opacity, resulting in models with different gas
densities in the wind. The effects which we investigate here are important for
the understanding of the wind mechanism and mass loss of AGB stars. This study
is hereby a necessary step towards more reliable interpretations of
observations. We find that the effects of drift generally are significant. They
cannot be predicted from models calculated without drift. Moreover, the
non-drift models showing the lowest mass loss rates, outflow velocities, and
the smallest variability in the degree of condensation do not form drift model
winds. The wind formation in drift models is, except for a few cases, generally
less efficient and the mass loss consequently lower than in the corresponding
non-drift models. The effects of drift are generally larger in the more
realistic models using that representation of the gas opacity which results in
lower densities. The outflow properties of these models are also -- for all
cases we have studied -- sensitive to the period of the stellar pulsations. A
check of the mass loss rates against a (recent) fit formula shows
systematically lower values, in particular in the more realistic models with a
low density. The fit is in its current form inapplicable to the new models
presented here.

is assumed to be comparable to or smaller than any relevant length of the
problem. Classical paths with extremal length partially creep along the
obstacle and their fluctuations are subject to non-holonomic constraints. If
the medium is a vacuum, the asymptotic contribution from a single classical
path of overall length L to the energy Green function at energy E is that of a
non-relativistic particle of mass E/c^2 moving in the two-dimensional space
orthogonal to the classical path for a time \tau=L/c. Dirichlet boundary
conditions at the surface of the obstacle constrain the motion of the particle
to the exterior half-space and result in an effective time-dependent but
spatially constant force that is inversely proportional to the radius of
curvature of the classical path. We relate the diffractive, classically
forbidden motion in the ""creeping"" case to the classically allowed motion in
the ""whispering gallery"" case by analytic continuation in the curvature of the
classical path. The non-holonomic constraint implies that the surface of the
obstacle becomes a zero-dimensional caustic of the particle's motion. We solve
this problem for extremal rays with piecewise constant curvature and provide
uniform asymptotic expressions that are approximately valid in the penumbra as
well as in the deep shadow of a sphere.

allow us to connect the results with observed features in real economies, e.g.,
lock-in (positive feedback), etc. We then implement the realistic notion that a
richer agent is less likely to be aggressive when bargaining over a small
amount with a poorer player. When this simple feature is added to the yard-sale
model, in addition to the accumulation of the total wealth by a single agent

layers on corrugated surfaces. The model can be applied to smectic phases of
liquid crystals, to lamellar phases of short-chain amphiphiles and to lamellar
phases of long-chain block copolymers. The corrugated surface is modelled by
having a single $q$-mode lateral corrugation of a certain height. The lamellae
deform close to the surface as a result of chemical interaction with it. The
competition between the energetic cost of elastic deformations and the gain in
surface energy determines whether parallel or perpendicular lamellar
orientation (with respect to the surface) is preferred. Our main results are
summarized in two phase diagrams, each exhibiting a transition line from the
parallel to perpendicular orientations. The phase diagrams depend on the three
system parameters: the lamellar natural periodicity, and the periodicity and
amplitude of surface corrugations. For a fixed lamellar periodicity (or polymer
chain length), the parallel orientation is preferred as the amplitude of
surface corrugation decreases and/or its periodicity increases. Namely, for
surfaces having small corrugations centered at long wavelengths. For a fixed
corrugation periodicity, the parallel orientation is preferred for small
corrugation amplitude and/or large lamellae periodicity. Our results are in

which can be used to derive a kinetic equation for a dilute gas of atoms
(bosons or fermions) with two internal states (treated as a pseudo-spin 1/2).
The collisional methods are in the spirit of Boltzmann's original derivation of
his kinetic equation where, at each point of space, the effects of all sorts of
possible binary collisions are added. We discuss two different versions of
collisional methods, the Yvon-Snider approach and the S matrix approach. The
second method uses the notion of mean field, which modifies the drift term of
the kinetic equation, in the line of the Landau theory of transport in quantum
liquids. For a dilute cold gas, it turns out that all these derivations lead to
the same drift terms in the transport equation, but differ in the precise
expression of the collision integral and in higher order gradient terms. In the
second part of the article, the kinetic equation is applied to spin waves in
trapped ultra-cold gases. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the
strongly non-hydrodynamic character of the spin waves recently observed with
trapped Rb87 atoms. The decay of the phenomenon, which takes place when the
system relaxes back towards equilibrium, is also discussed, with a short
comment on decoherence.

introducing a new dynamical variable describing the adaptation of drivers to
the surrounding traffic situation during the past few minutes (``subjective
level of service'') and couple this internal state to parameters of the
underlying model that are related to the driving style. % For illustration, we
use the intelligent-driver model (IDM) as underlying model, characterize the
level of service solely by the velocity and couple the internal variable to the

congested traffic (``frustration effect''), that is supported by single-vehicle

apparent ``stochasticity'' of the region of the scattered data points agree

perturbations. The detailed fall off properties of the perturbations, as well
as the gauge conditions that need to be imposed to make the perturbations
regular at infinity, are qualitatively different in higher dimensions; in
particular, the decay rate of a radiating solution at null infinity differs
from that of a static solution in higher dimensions. The definition of
asymptotic flatness in higher dimensions consequently also differs
qualitatively from that in $d=4$.
  We then derive an expression for the generator conjugate to an asymptotic
time translation symmetry for asymptotically flat spacetimes in $d$-dimensional
general relativity ($d$ even) within the Hamiltonian framework, making use
especially of a formalism developed by Wald and Zoupas. This generator is given
by an integral over a cross section at null infinity of a certain local
expression and is taken to be the definition of the Bondi energy in $d$
dimensions. Our definition yields a manifestly positive flux of radiated
energy.
  Our definitions and constructions fail in odd spacetime dimensions,
essentially because the regularity properties of the metric at null infinity
seem to be insufficient in that case. We also find that there is no direct

the simplest case of geodesics around a Schwarzschild black hole the orbits,
though unstable, are regular. Under perturbation the unstable orbits can become
the locus of chaos. All unstable orbits, whether regular or chaotic, can be
quantified by their Lyapunov exponents. The exponents are observationally
relevant since the phase of gravitational waves can decohere in a Lyapunov
time. If the timescale for dissipation due to gravitational waves is shorter
than the Lyapunov time, chaos will be damped and essentially unobservable. We
find the timescales can be comparable. We emphasize that the Lyapunov exponents
must only be used cautiously for several reasons: they are relative and depend
on the coordinate system used, they vary from orbit to orbit, and finally they
can be deceptively diluted by transient behaviour for orbits which pass in and

about 1GeV in the typical hadronic scale, which is relatively large compared
with the excitation energy of the quark origin. This large gluonic excitation

which bilarge neutrino mixing is incorporated. Because the up-type and

with respect to the usual SU(5), the radiatively generated flavor mixing in
squark mass matrices due to the large neutrino mixing has a pattern different
from those in the conventional SU(5) and SO(10) supersymmetric GUTs. This leads
to phenomenological consequences quite different from SU(5) or SO(10)
supersymmetric GUT models. That is, it has almost no impact on B physics. On
the contrary, the model has effects in top and charm physics as well as lepton
physics. In particular, it gives promising prediction on the mass difference,
$\Delta M_D$, of the $D-{\bar D}$ mixing which for some ranges of the parameter
space with large $\tan\beta$ can be at the order of $10^9 ~\hbar ~s^{-1}$, one
order of magnitude smaller than the experimental upper bound. In some regions
of the parameter space $\Delta M_D$ can saturate the present bound. For these
ranges of parameter space, $t \to u,c+h^0$ can reach $10^{-5}-10^{-6}$ which
would be observed at the LHC and future $\gamma-\gamma$ colliders.

then, by a result of Anselmi et. al., the central charge \it{a} of the SCFT.
Our a_{trial} maximization principle almost immediately ensures that the
central charge \it{a} decreases upon any RG flow, since relevant deformations
force a_{trial} to be maximized over a subset of the previously possible
R-symmetries. Using a_{trial} maximization, we find the exact superconformal
R-symmetry (and thus the exact anomalous dimensions of all chiral operators) in
a variety of previously mysterious 4d N=1 SCFTs. As a check, we verify that our
exact results reproduce the perturbative anomalous dimensions in all

stationary state \psi_q\in W(p) then measurements of the non-commuting
Cartesian coordinates of the particle are such that their allowed values are
consistent with it being found at a finite number of sites, called ``nests''.
These lie on a sphere centered on the origin of fixed, finite radius \varrho_q.
The nests themselves are at the vertices of a rectangular parallelepiped. In
the typical cases (p>2) the number of nests is 8 for q=0 and 3, and varies from
8 to 24, depending on the state, for q=1 and 2. The number of nests is less in
the atypical cases (p=1,2), but it is never less than two. In certain states in
W(2) (resp. in W(1)) the oscillator is ``polarized'' so that all the nests lie
on a plane (resp. on a line). The particle cannot be localized in any one of
the available nests alone since the coordinates do not commute. The
probabilities of measuring particular values of the coordinates are discussed.
The mean trajectories and the standard deviations of the coordinates and
momenta are computed, and conclusions are drawn about uncertainty relations.

A.M.S. (July 2004)",,,,"math.RT math.AG math.QA",,"  We establish equivalences of derived categories of the following 3
categories:
  (1) Principal block of representations of the quantum at a root of 1;
  (2) G-equivariant coherent sheaves on the Springer resolution;
  (3) Perverse sheaves on the loop Grassmannian for the Langlands dual group.
  The equivalence (1)-(2) is an `enhancement' of the known expression for
quantum group cohomology in terms of nilpotent variety, due to Ginzburg-Kumar.
The equivalence (2)-(3) is a step towards resolving an old mystery surrounding
the existense of two completely different realizations of the affine Hecke
algebra which have played a key role in the proof of the
Deligne-Langlands-Lusztig conjecture. One realization is in terms of locally
constant functions on the flag manifold of a p-adic reductive group, while the
other is in terms of equivariant K-theory of a complex (Steinberg) variety for
the dual group. Our equivalence (2)-(3) may be viewed as a `categorification'
of the isomorphism between the corresponding two geometric realizations of the
fundamental polynomial representation of the affine Hecke algebra. The
composite of the two equivalences above yields an equivalence between abelian
categories of quantum group representations and perverse sheaves. A similar
equivalence at an even root of unity can be deduced, following Lusztig program,
from earlier deep results of Kazhdan-Lusztig and Kashiwara-Tanisaki. Our
approach is independent of these results and is totally different (it does not
rely on representation theory of Kac-Moody algebras). It also gives way to
proving Humphreys' conjectures on tilting U_q(g)-modules, as will be explained
in a separate paper.

example, a minimum localization width where the components of only two

random distribution of particle contributions, a delocalization associated with
a uniform distribution and a delocalization associated with a wave-like
structure in the Lyapunov vector. Using the localization width we show that in
quasi-one-dimensional systems of many hard disks there are two kinds of
dependence of the localization width on the Lyapunov exponent index for the
larger exponents: one is exponential, and the other is linear. Differences, due
to these kinds of localizations also appear in the shapes of the localized
peaks of the Lyapunov vectors, the Lyapunov spectra and the angle between the
spatial and momentum parts of the Lyapunov vectors. We show that the Krylov
relation for the largest Lyapunov exponent $\lambda\sim-\rho\ln\rho$ as a
function of the density $\rho$ is satisfied (apart from a factor) in the same
density region as the linear dependence of the localization widths is observed.

also the renormalization of collective vibrational modes through vertex and

occurs for infinitesimal perturbations around the lithostatic pressure taken as

shown to (i) rotate, widen or narrow the different lobes of stress transfer,
(ii) to modify the $1/r^2$ 2D-decay of elastic stress Green functions into the
generalized power law $1/r^{\gamma}$ where $\gamma$ depends on the azimuth and
on the amplitude of the modulii asymmetry. Using reasonable estimates, this
implies an enhancement of the range of interaction between earthquakes by a
factor up to 5-10 at distances of several tens of rupture length. This may
explain certain long-range earthquake triggering and hydrological anomalies in
wells and suggest to revisit the standard stress transfer calculations which
use linear elasticity. We also show that the standard double-couple of forces

fault plane, which suggests a mechanism for the non-zero isotropic component of

dynamics -- the composition of forward and backward time evolutions generated
by two slightly different Hamiltonians, such as the state autocorrelation
function (fidelity) and the purity of a reduced density matrix traced over a
subsystem (purity fidelity). Our main theoretical result is a linear response
formalism, expressing the fidelity and purity fidelity in terms of integrated
time autocorrelation function of the generator of the perturbation.
Surprisingly, this relation predicts that the decay of fidelity is the slower
the faster the decay of correlations. In particular for a static
(time-independent) perturbation, and for non-ergodic and non-mixing dynamics
where asymptotic decay of correlations is absent, a qualitatively different and
faster decay of fidelity is predicted on a time scale 1/delta as opposed to
mixing dynamics where the fidelity is found to decay exponentially on a
time-scale 1/delta^2, where delta is a strength of perturbation. A detailed
discussion of a semi-classical regime of small effective values of Planck
constant is given where classical correlation functions can be used to predict
quantum fidelity decay. Note that the correct and intuitively expected
classical stability behavior is recovered in the classical limit, as the
perturbation and classical limits do not commute. The theoretical results are
demonstrated numerically for two models, the quantized kicked top and the
multi-level Jaynes Cummings model. Our method can for example be applied to the
stability analysis of quantum computation and quantum information processing.

method to search for microlensing events towards galactic globular clusters may
increase the statistics and discriminate among different halo models.
Stimulated by this proposal, we evaluate an upper limit to the pixel lensing
event rate for such a survey. Four different dark halo models have been
considered changing both the flattening and the slope of the mass density
profile. The lenses mass function has been modelled as a homogenous power - law
for $\mu \in (\mu_l, \mu_u)$ and both the mass limits and the slope of the mass
function have been varied to investigate their effect on the rate. The target
globular clusters have been selected in order to minimize the disk contribution
to the event rate. We find that a pixel lensing survey towards globular
clusters is unable to discriminate among different halo models since the number
of detectable events is too small to allow any reliable statistical analysis.

several gamma-ray burst afterglows. Whereas the degree of polarization, $P$,
was found to vary in some sources, the position angle, $\theta_p$, was roughly
constant in all cases. Until now, the polarization has been commonly attributed
to synchrotron radiation from a jet with a tangled magnetic field that is
viewed somewhat off axis. However, this model predicts either a peak in $P$ or
a $90^\circ$ change in $\theta_p$ around the ``jet break'' time in the
lightcurve, for which there has so far been no observational confirmation. We
propose an alternative interpretation, wherein the polarization is attributed,
at least in part, to a large-scale, ordered magnetic field in the ambient
medium. The ordered component may dominate the polarization even if the total
emissivity is dominated by a tangled field generated by postshock turbulence.
In this picture, $\theta_p$ is roughly constant because of the uniformity of
the field, whereas $P$ varies as a result of changes in the ratio of the
ordered-to-random mean-squared field amplitudes. We point out that variable
afterglow light curves should be accompanied by a variable polarization. The
radiation from the original ejecta, which includes the prompt gamma-ray
emission and the emission from the reverse shock (the `optical flash' and
`radio flare'), could potentially exhibit a high degree of polarization (up to
$\sim 60%$) induced by an ordered transverse magnetic field advected from the
central source.

the ecliptic. We present theoretical models for a wide range of particle size
distributions and compositions. The observed temperature is as expected for
large (>10 um radius), low-albedo (< 0.08), rapidly-rotating, grey particles 1
AU from the Sun. In addition to the continuum, we detect a weak excess in the
9-11 um range, with an amplitude of 6% of the continuum. The shape of the
feature can be matched by a mixture of silicates: amorphous forsterite/olivine,
dirty crystalline olivine, and a hydrous silicate (montmorillonite). The
presence of hydrous silicate suggests the parent bodies of those particles were
formed in the inner solar nebula. Large particles dominate the size
distribution, but at least some small particles (radii ~1 um) are required to
produce the silicate emission feature. To compare the properties of zodiacal
dust to dust around other main sequence stars, we reanalyzed the exozodiacal

several WDM models with masses m_W = 0.75, 1.5, 3.0 keV. The substructure mass
fraction is relatively insensitive to the tilt and overall normalization of the
power spectrum. All CDM-type models yield projected substructure mass fractions
that are consistent with, but on the low side of, estimates from strong lens
systems: f = 0.4-1.5% (64 percentile) in systems M_sub < 10^9 Msun. Truncated
models produce significantly smaller fractions and are disfavored by lensing
results. We compare our predicted subhalo velocity functions to the dwarf
satellite population of the Milky Way. Assuming isotropic velocity dispersions,
we find the standard n=1 model overpredicts the number of MW satellites as
expected. Models with less small-scale power are more successful because there
are fewer subhalos of a given circular velocity and the mapping between
observed velocity dispersion and halo circular velocity is markedly altered.
The RI model, or a fixed tilt with sigma_8=0.75, can account for the MW dwarfs
without the need for differential feedback; however, these comparisons depend
sensitively on the assumption of isotropic velocities in satellite galaxies.

predictions of dusty tori show that the nuclear unresolved NIR-MIR emission is
compatible with a broad range of models: the nuclear SED alone does not
strongly constrain the torus geometry, while placing reasonable constraints on
its size and thickness. The extended MIR emission observed within the ionizing
cone is shown to be well explained by the presence of optically thick dust
clouds exposed to the central engine radiation and having a small covering
factor. Conversely, a distribution of diffuse dust particles within the
ionizing cone is discarded. A simple model for the H2 and CO emission observed
perpendicularly to the axis of the ionizing cone is proposed. We show that a
slight tilt between the molecular disc and the Compton thick central absorber
naturally reproduces the observed distribution of H2 of CO emission.

study are those attributed to slow collisional relaxation and generically
called ""dynamical friction"". We start by revisiting the problem of the sinking
of a satellite inside an initially isotropic, non-rotating, spherical galaxy,
which we follow by means of N-body simulations using about one million
particles. We then consider a quasi-spherical problem, in which the satellite
is fragmented into a set of many smaller masses with a spherically symmetric
initial density distribution. In a wide set of experiments, designed in order
to bring out effects genuinely associated with dynamical friction, we are able
to demonstrate the slow evolution of the density profile and the development of
a tangentially biased pressure in the underlying stellar system, while we
briefly address the issue of the circularization of orbits induced by dynamical
friction on the population of fragments. The results of the simulations
presented here and others planned for future investigations allow us to study
the basic mechanisms of slow relaxation in stellar systems and thus may be of
general interest for a variety of problems, especially in the cosmological
context. Here our experiments are conceived with the specific goal to clarify
some mechanisms that may play a role in the evolution of an elliptical galaxy
as a result of the interaction between the stars and a significant population
of globular clusters or of the merging of a large number of small satellites.

the larger sources (>0.5 kpc). Both a spherical and an axi-symmetric gas
distribution, with a radial power law density profile, can be used to explain
this anti-correlation between projected linear size and HI column density.
Since most detections occur in objects classified as galaxies, we argue that if
the unified schemes apply to GPS/CSSs a disk distribution for the HI is more
likely. The most favoured explanation for the compact sizes of the GPS/CSSs is
that they are young sources evolving in a power law density medium. For the
GPSs with measured expansion velocities, our derived densities are within an
order of magnitude of those estimated from ram-pressure confinement of the
lobes assuming equipartition. Our results therefore support the youth model.

account the absorption associated with the AGN, the optical faintness of the

new spectroscopic observations have revealed the expected AGN features also in
the optical band. These results clearly show that optical spectroscopy
sometimes can be inefficient in revealing the presence of an AGN, which instead
is clearly found from an X-ray spectroscopic investigation. This remarks the
importance of being careful in proposing the identification of X-ray sources

biological processes need be elucidated. A method is available for determining
biochemical-reaction or metabolic pathways through its systematic synthesis. It
is based on a rigorous graph-theoretic method for identifying pathways of
catalytic reactions. It synthesizes networks of metabolic pathways using a
highly exacting combinatorial method. It generates not only all feasible,
independent reaction networks but also those combinations of independent
pathways. This method can determine the mechanisms of complex chemical
reactions and is applicable to biochemical reactions. It is important to

spatial correlation among nuclei. This is achieved through a detailed study of
a system of distinguishable and correlated dots (nuclei). The probability that
no dots be in a region of the space has been evaluated in terms of correlation
functions. The theory has been applied to describe nucleation and growth in two

briefly our class of weighted automata, as a very general model type. Then
Valued Computational Tree Logic (CTL$) is introduced as a natural extension of

formation is derived from a bimetric gravity theory. By requiring that the

determine the fundamental length scale in the model to be a factor of 10^5
times larger than the Planck length, which results in a scalar mode spectral
index: n_s\approx 0.97, and its running: \alpha_s\approx -5\times 10^{-4}. This
is accomplished in the variable speed of light (VSL) metric frame, in which the
dynamics of perturbations of the bimetric scalar field are determined by a
minimally-coupled Klein-Gordon equation, and it is assumed that modes are born
in a ground state at a scale given by the fundamental length scale appearing in
the bimetric structure. We show that while this is taking place for scales of
interest, the background (primordial) radiation energy density is strongly
suppressed as a result of the bimetric structure of the model. Nevertheless,
the enlarged lightcone of matter fields ensures that the horizon and flatness

the expansion rate in the de Sitter Universe; and (iii) to the rotation in the
Goedel Universe. In all these steady state Universes, the gravitating vacuum
energy is zero in the absence of the perturbation, and is proportional to the
energy density of perturbation. This is in a full agreement with the
thermodynamic Gibbs-Duhem relation applicable to any quantum vacuum. It
demonstrates that (i) the cosmological constant is not huge, since according to
the Gibbs-Duhem relation the contribution of zero point fluctuations to the
vacuum energy is cancelled by the trans-Planckian degrees of freedom; (ii) the
cosmological constant is non-zero, since the perturbations of the vacuum state
induce the non-zero vacuum energy; and (iii) the gravitating vacuum energy is
on the order of the energy density of matter and/or of other perturbations. We
also consider the vacuum response to the non-steady-state perturbations. In
this case the Einstein equations are modified to include the non-covariant
corrections, which are responsible for the relaxation of the cosmological
constant. The connection to the quintessence is demonstrated. The problem of
the energy-momentum tensor for the gravitational field is discussed in terms of
effective gravity. The difference between the momentum and pseudo-momentum of
gravitational waves in general relativity is similar to that for sound waves in

need a few ten thousand events to identify the Earth effects, a few thousand
may be enough at scintillation detectors, which generically have a much better
energy resolution. A successful identification of the Earth effects through
this method can also provide $\Delta m^2_\odot$ to a good accuracy. The
relative strength of the detected Earth effects as a function of time provides
a test for supernova models.

from a phase transition the bulk of the quantum interaction inherent to the

collective part made of low-energy condensed degrees of freedom. The properties
of (some of the) statistically fluctuating fields are determined by these
condensate(s). This leads to a quasi-particle description at tree-level. It
appears that radiative corrections, which are sizable at large gauge coupling,
do not change the tree-level picture qualitatively. The thermodynamic
self-consistency of the quasi-particle approach implies nonperturbative
evolution equations for the associated masses. The temperature dependence of
these masses, in turn, determine the evolution of the gauge coupling(s). The
hot gauge system approaches the behavior of an ideal gas of massless gluons at
asymptotically large temperature. A negative equation of state is possible at a
stage where the system is about to settle into the phase of the (spontaneously

hep-th/0110196, the 1-loop anomalous dimension can be made small by tuning
quantum numbers. We also comment on a possibility of deriving the semiclassical
relation between \Delta and J or S from the marginality condition for the

expression for their 2-point correlator on a complex plane.

  theory in three Euclidean dimensions","16 pages",,,"IMSc/2003/04/04","hep-th cond-mat",,"  A method for systematically including topological degrees of freedom in
perturbation theory is developed. This is not bound by the restrictions of
semi-classical techniques. The Yang-Mills theory in three Euclidean dimensions
is considered here. A well-defined separation of the topological and the ``spin
wave'' degrees of freedom is obtained, motivated by a singular gauge. This has
``photons'' distorting the spherically symmetric magnetic fields of Dirac
monopoles, and massless charged vector bosons ``W'' scattering off the latter.
It is explicitly shown that the Dirac string does not contribute. The mode of
the charged vector bosons with total angular momentum J=0 provides precisely
the core to give a finite energy to the monopole. The radial equation for W is
remarkably simplified and only two polarization states survive exactly for the
anomalous magnetic moment required by the Yang-Mills interaction.

Another, simpler way, is to use calibrations. In order for a wrapped brane to
be BPS, the cycle it wraps must be calibrated; given the relevant calibration,
there exists a procedure which yields the supergravity solution almost
immediately. In the past, this method was applied only to Kahler calibrations,
as these were the only ones known to exist in backgrounds with non-trivial
flux. We extend this method to a wider domain, using a constraint to classify
possible calibrations. A rule is given which can generate the required

due to automatic cancellation of the brane tension by the curvature induced by

original shape,whose use disappeared completely, proves that these numerals
have their origin in the Arabic letters. Contrary to what some hypotheses
pretend, particularly those that present them as drifting of Indian characters,
the 10 Arabic numerals that we use are, nothing else, 10 Arabic letters more or
less modified and taken in the ""Abjadi"" order. The hypothesis of the Indian
origin of the Arabic numerals is revealed a mistake denied by the shape of the
Arabic numerals and by the logic of the right to left representation of the
numbers and the algorithm of the elementary operations. The Arabic numerals
that simplified the writing of the numbers and the algorithms of the elementary
operations are believed to be born in the Maghreb(North Africa). From Bejaia
(Bougie) they passed in to Europe to give, after evolution, the modern Arabic
numerals : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. they also migrate to the Middle East
(the Mashrek) to give, after transformations in shape and adding two Hebrew
letters, the Arabic numerals, ""Mashrekis"", that are used currently in Middle
East.

Math",,"10.1007/s00222-004-0361-8",,"math.AC math.AG",,"  In the present paper, we define a notion of numerical equivalence on Chow
groups or Grothendieck groups of Noetherian local rings, which is an analogue
of that on smooth projective varieties. Under a mild condition, it is proved
that the Chow group modulo numerical equivalence is a finite dimensional ${\Bbb
Q}$-vector space, as in the case of smooth projective varieties. Numerical
equivalence on local rings is deeply related to that on smooth projective
varieties. For example, if Grothendieck's standard conjectures are true, then a
vanishing of Chow group (of local rings) modulo numerical equivalence can be
proven. Using the theory of numerical equivalence, the notion of numerically
Roberts rings is defined. It is proved that a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of
positive characteristic is a numerically Roberts ring if and only if the
Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of a maximal primary ideal of finite projective
dimension is always equal to its colength. Numerically Roberts rings satisfy
the vanishing property of intersection multiplicities. We shall prove another
special case of the vanishing of intersection multiplicities using a vanishing
of localized Chern characters.

that finds the events will automatically measure the proper motion and one
projection of the ``vector microlens parallax.'' If the satellite is placed in
an L2 orbit, or a highly elliptical orbit around the Earth, the Earth-satellite
baseline is sufficient to measure a second projection of the vector microlens
parallax from the difference in the lightcurves as seen from the Earth and the
satellite as the source passes over the caustic structure induced by the
planet. This completes the mass measurement.

masses of about 10^12 solar masses, in agreement with observations of a weak
dependence of clustering on luminosity at luminosities less than L*. The model
is in qualitative agreement with observations that at low luminosities galaxy
clustering is a strong function of color while at high luminosities galaxy
clustering is a strong function of luminosity.

Tests of a simple model of an exponential stellar disk superimposed on a
Burkert-profile halo demonstrate that strong lensing is unlikely without an
additional concentration of mass in the galaxy center (e.g. a bulge). The fact
that most strong lenses on galactic scales are elliptical galaxies suggests
that a strong central concentration of baryons is required to produce image
splitting. This solution is less attractive for clusters of galaxies, which are
generally considered to be dark-matter dominated even at small radii. There are
three possible implications of these results: (1) dark halos may have a variety
of inner profiles (2) dark matter halos may not follow a single scaling
relation from galaxy scale up to cluster scale and/or (3) the splitting of
images (even by clusters of galaxies) may in general be due to the central
concentration of baryonic material in halos rather than dark matter.

system. It covers the traditional comets as well as the Centaurs and
Edgeworth-Kuiper belt objects. At low inclinations, close encounters with
planets often result in near-constant perihelion or aphelion distances, or in
perihelion-aphelion interchanges, so the minor bodies can be labelled according
to the planets predominantly controlling them at perihelion and aphelion. For
example, a JN object has a perihelion under the control of Jupiter and aphelion
under the control of Neptune, and so on. This provides 20 dynamically distinct
categories of outer Solar system objects in the Jovian and trans-Jovian
regions. The Tisserand parameter with respect to the planet controlling
perihelion is also often roughly constant under orbital evolution. So, each
category can be further sub-divided according to the Tisserand parameter. The
dynamical evolution of comets, however, is dominated not by the planets nearest
at perihelion or aphelion, but by the more massive Jupiter. The comets are
separated into four categories -- Encke-type, short-period, intermediate and
long-period -- according to aphelion distance. The Tisserand parameter
categories now roughly correspond to the well-known Jupiter-family comets,
transition-types and Halley-types. In this way, the nomenclature for the
Centaurs and Edgeworth-Kuiper belt objects is based on, and consistent with,
that for comets.

this model, which allows the Galactic thin disk to form from slightly
metal-enriched gas with alpha-element enhancement. Our model predicts ages for
the stellar halo and thin disk of 12.5 and 7.4 Gyr, respectively, in agreement
with empirically determined values. The model presented in this paper is
compared with a similar dual-phase infall model from Chiappini et al. (2001).
We discuss a degeneracy that enables both models to recover the K-dwarf
metallicity distribution while yielding different star formation histories.
  The metallicity distribution function (MDF) of K-dwarfs is proposed to be
more directly comparable to chemical evolution model results than the G-dwarf
distribution because lower mass K-dwarfs are less susceptible to stellar
evolutionary effects. The K-dwarf MDF should consequently be a better probe of
star formation history and provide a stronger constraint to chemical evolution
models than the widely used G-dwarf MDF. The corrections that should be applied
to a G-dwarf MDF are quantified for the case of the outer halo of NGC 5128.

have already been associated to visible enhancements of the projected galaxy

discretized constraints during a free evolution of Einstein's equations. During
an evolution, any given family of formulations is adjusted off the constraints
surface in a way such that, for any chosen numerical method and arbitrary but
fixed resolution, the constraints growth can be minimized with respect to the
freedom allowed by the formulation. In particular, provided there is enough
freedom, the discretized constraints can be maintained close to its initial
truncation value for all times, or decay from it.
  No a priori knowledge of the solution is needed, and the method can be
applied to any formulation of Einstein's equations without affecting

rotational as well as translational degrees of freedom. In this wave the
fluctuating quantity is a vector, the bulk spin. The transmission is similar to
compressive waves but propagation is possible even in the limit of

context a kinetic theory of space-time is introduced, in which hypothetical
constituents of the space-time manifold possess such a rotational degree of
freedom (spin). Physical fields (i.e. electromagnetic or gravitational) in such
a theory are represented as moments of a statistical distribution of these

governing light and metric. Such a theory duplicates to first order Maxwell's
equations of electromagnetism, Schrodinger's equation for the electron, and the
Lorentz transformations of special relativity. Slight deviations from the

we construct a transform theory which is a nontrivial generalization of a

the solutions of the eigenvalue problem. Moreover, the derivation of the
transform formulas needed to solve the wave propagation problem involves
nontrivial calculations.

the wave propagation problem in a 3-D optical waveguide with cylindrical

diffusion coefficient. We analyse this classical effect, and we show that it is
enhanced by dynamical localization.

that the traditional interpretation of this normalization as the square root of
a spectroscopic factor is only valid for one particular choice of projection
operator. This causes no problem for the calculation of the decay width in a

canonical partition function and Feynman's path integral approach to
statistical processes. These models can be written as special cases of a more
general distribution which has three control parameters which are $a$, $x$,
$z$. The relation to these parameters to various physical quantities are
discussed. A connection of the parameter $a$ with Fisher's critical exponent
$\tau$ is developed. Using this grand canonical approach, moments, cumulants
and combinants are discussed and a physical interpretation of the combinants
are given and their behavior connected to the critical exponent $\tau$. Various
physical phenomena such as hierarchical structure, void scaling relations, KNO
scaling features, clan variables, and branching laws are shown in terms of this
general approach. Several of these features which were previously developed in
terms of the negative binomial distribution are found to be more general. Both
hierarchical structure and void scaling relations depend on the Fisher exponent
$\tau$. Applications of our approach to the charged particle multiplicity
distribution in jets of L3 and H1 data are given. It is shown that just looking
at the mean and fluctuation of data is not enough to distinguish these
distributions or the underlying mechanism. The mean, fluctuation and third
cummulant of distribution determine three parameters $x$, $z$, $a$. We find
that a generalized random work model fits the data better than the widely used
negative binomial model.

49 provide a reliable estimate. Application of strict a posteriori criteria

to check the presence of intermediate directions interpreted to belong to a
geomagnetic field excursion within the Brunhes epoch, completing this
paleomagnetic record with paleointensity determinations and radiometric dating.
The directional results corroborate the findings by Watkins and Nougier (1973)
: normal polarity is found for two units and an intermediate direction, with
associated VGPs close to the equator, for the other two units. A notable result
is that these volcanic rocks are well suited for absolute paleointensity
determinations. Fifty percent of the samples yields reliable intensity values
with high quality factors. An original element of this study is that we made
use of the PTRM-tail test of Shcherbakova et al. (2000) to help in the
interpretation of the paleointensity measurements. Doing thus, only the high
temperature intervals, beyond 400 degres C, were retained to obtain the most
reliable estimate of the strength of the ancient magnetic field. The normal
units yield Virtual Dipole Moments (VDM) of 6.2 and 7.7 10e22 Am2 and the
excursional units yield values of 3.7 and 3.4 10e22 Am2. These results are
quite consistent with the other Thellier determinations from Brunhes excursion
records, all characterized by a decrease of the VDM as VGP latitude decreases.
40Ar/39Ar isotopic age determinations provide an estimate of 26+-15 Kyr and
18+-9 Kyr for the transitional lava flows, which could correspond to the Mono
Lake excursion. However, the large error bars associated with these ages do not
exclude the hypothesis that this event is the Laschamp.

recently measured EPR data from the Innsbruck collaboration. The model is based
on the idea that waves in the zero-point field convey information from the
detectors to the source, stimulating the spontaneous emission of photons with
definite polarizations. In order to match experimental data, the model is
augmented with a further local assumption that the ``master'' photon (going
back along the direction of the zero-point wave that triggered emission) will
not be detected if the polarizer is not in the same orientation as the
stimulated wave. This model predicts a ratio of coincidences to singles of 1/3
compared to standard quantum mechanics' 2/3 for the 2-fold choice of modulator
settings, and predicts that a 20-fold choice of settings will yield a
coincidence ratio of 1/40 with the SQM ratio unchanged. Such an outcome should
be easily distinguishable given the Innsbruck group's measured efficiency of
1/20 in their experiment. This model also predicts that a coincidence at
polarizer settings (a,b,t) will never be correlated with its time-retarded
complement setting, (a',b',t-2L/c), a prediction for whose test the limited
data publicly available at this time is inadequate.

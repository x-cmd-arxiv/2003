the novalike (NL) cataclysmic variable V348 Pup through and after eclipse.
Outside of eclipse, the spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum, strong
line emission, and a broad dip from 2000 -- 3000 A. The continuum eclipse depth
is roughly the same over the entire wavelength range covered and there are no
signatures of the WD eclipse in the light curves. Model steady-state accretion
disk spectra provide a poor fit to the shape of the UV-optical spectrum outside
of eclipse. All of these properties are consistent with a disk that is
self-shielding, hiding the inner disk and the white dwarf. In eclipse, the
emission lines and the broad dip are occulted less than the continuum,
indicating vertical extension in these components. The dip is consistent with
the presence of a vertical ``Fe II'' absorbing curtain in the system. Archival
UV-optical spectra of the lower-inclination NL UX UMa show a bluer continuum
and weaker line emission than in V348 Pup and no broad dip. There is strong
flickering in V348 Pup. The flickering spectrum shows that the flickering
occurs only in the continuum. We did not detect any periodicities associated
with the rapid variability. The properties of V348 Pup are consistent with its
previous identification as a member of the SW Sex sub-class of NLs.

the distribution of molecular gas around the Tornado complements its radio

the presence of shocked molecular gas at the location where the nebula is

  It has been suggested that the Eye of the Tornado is related to the nebula on

Submitted to ApJ","Astrophys.J. 593 (2003) 1116-1123","10.1086/376569",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a method for calculating the radiative tranfer on a protoplanetary
disk perturbed by a protoplanet. We apply this method to determine the effect
on the temperature structure within the photosphere of a passive circumstellar
disk in the vicinity of a small protoplanet of up to 20 Earth masses. The
gravitational potential of a protoplanet induces a compression of the disk
material near it, resulting in a decrement in the density at the disk's
surface. Thus, an isodensity contour at the height of the photosphere takes on
the shape of a well. When such a well is illuminated by stellar irradiation at
grazing incidence, it results in cooling in a shadowed region and heating in an
exposed region. For typical stellar and disk parameters relevant to the epoch
of planet formation, we find that the temperature variation due to a
protoplanet at 1 AU separation from its parent star is about 4% (5 K) for a
planet of 1 Earth mass, about 14% (19 K) for planet of 10 Earth masses, and
about 18% (25 K) for planet of 20 Earth masses, We conclude that even such

Lick indices for 47 GCs in M49 from LRIS/Keck spectra and establish their
metallicity parameters qualitatively in comparison to the Galactic GCs and to
published data for 150 M87 GCs. We then compare our measurements with the
predictions of models for the integrated light of old single burst stellar
systems by Worthey and by Thomas, Maraston & Bender. We find that the
metallicity of the M49 GC system spans the range from [Fe/H]_Z = -2.0 to +0.4
dex. We show that the metallicity and age parameters for these two GC systems
are basically identical, except that the M49 GCs reach slightly higher
metallicities than do those of M87. We find that the GCs of both of these giant
elliptical galaxies are alpha-enhanced by a factor of about two above the Solar
value, as is also true of the Galactic GCs. While adoption of the
alpha-enhanced models of TMB has eliminated most of the previous discrepancies
with observations, the most metal rich M49 GCs have NaD lines which are still
considerably stronger than those predicted by any model, and there are still
issues involving the metallicity scale of these models. We find that in the
mean, the M49 GCs are at least 10 Gyr old. However, the grids of models we used
differ in how they treat the horizontal branch, and this perceptibly affects
the predicted Hbeta index. Hence our current incomplete understanding of the

variable morphological characteristics. The detection of HI bubbles on a global
scale therefore never has been attempted. In this paper, an automatic detector
for expanding HI shells is presented. The detection is based on the more stable
dynamical characteristics of expanding shells and is performed in two stages.
The first one is the recognition of the dynamical signature of an expanding
bubble in the velocity spectra, based on the classification of an artificial
neural network. The pixels associated with these recognized spectra are
identified on each velocity channel. The second stage consists in looking for
concentrations of those pixels that were firstly pointed out, and to decide if
they are potential detections by morphological and 21-cm emission variation
considerations. Two test bubbles are correctly detected and a potentially new
case of shell that is visually very convincing is discovered. About 0.6% of the
surveyed pixels are identified as part of a bubble. These may be false
detections, but still constitute regions of space with high probability of
finding an expanding shell. The subsequent search field is thus significantly
reduced. We intend to conduct in the near future a large scale HI shells
detection over the Perseus Arm using our detector.

and flux densities of these VLBI components are not consistent with starburst
generated radio supernovae of the type found in Arp 220. On scales of 100pc the

  Confirming and extending VLBI imaging of Mrk 231 by Ulvestad et al. (1999),
our continuum image shows a triple structure, with a core and two lobes,
classifying it as a Compact Symmetric Object (CS0). If the southern (primary)
lobe/hot-spot in Mrk 231 is confined by ram pressure, we estimate a lobe
advance speed, $v_a \sim 10^{-4}c$, and an age for the jet/compact source, $<
10^6 yr$. We have also imaged the 1667 MHz OH maser emission in Mrk 231, which
is extended on scales of 50--100 milliarcsec (40--80 pc) and probably coincides
with the inner region of the disk which is seen in CO emission and HI
absorption. Among OH megamasers studied at high sensitivity with mas
resolution, Mrk 231 is unique in the stringent upper limits placed upon the
flux density of compact OH structures of the type found in Arp 220 and other

sufficiently disrupted by the emergent QSO that the cool, dense clouds
necessary for such compact masers no longer exist.

We solved the near-far problem in the inner Galaxy by a fitting method which
involves introducing a model of vertical HI distribution.
  In our resultant maps we could trace three prominent arms: the
Sagittarius-Carina arm, the Perseus arm, and the Outer arm. These three arms
were found to be logarithmic spiral arms. The pitch angles of the
Sagittarius-Carina, Perseus, and Outer arms were estimated to be about
$11\arcdeg$, $18\arcdeg$, and $7\arcdeg$, respectively. The Sun is located in a

  The HI disk shows large and asymmetric warping in the outer disk: the HI disk
goes up to about 1.5 kpc above the Galactic plane in the northern hemisphere,
and down to about 1 kpc in the southern hemisphere, which means asymmetric
warping. The inner HI disk is also found to be tilting. The radius of the HI
disk is about 17 kpc and the HI mass within this radius is estimated to be $2.5

predicted from the rotation curve. We also found that the HI outskirt is
largely swelling in the fourth quadrant, and hence the Galaxy is significantly
lopsided. The scale-height of the HI layer increases with the radius, and is
correlated with the HI volume density at the centroid of the HI layer.

over the optical, both because they are so much brighter in the infrared, and
because their prominent methane absorptions lead to similar effective
wavelengths through the J-filter for both target and reference stars, which in
turn results in a dramatic reduction in differential colour refraction effects.
We describe a technique for robust bias estimation and linearity correction
with the SOFI camera, along with an upper limit to the astrometric distortion
of the SOFI optical train. Colour-magnitude and spectral-type-magnitude
diagrams for both L and T dwarfs are presented which show complex and
significant structure, with major import for luminosity function and mass
function work on T dwarfs. Based on the width of the early L dwarf and late T
dwarf colour magnitude diagrams, we conclude the brightening of early T dwarfs

complexity of brown dwarf cooling curves. Finally, empirical estimates of the

stress in a disordered state) at zero temperature and applied stress. For each
configuration, there is a unique jamming threshold, $\phi_c$, at which
particles can no longer avoid each other and the bulk and shear moduli
simultaneously become non-zero. The distribution of $\phi_c$ values becomes
narrower as the system size increases, so that essentially all configurations
jam at the same $\phi$ in the thermodynamic limit. This packing fraction
corresponds to the previously measured value for random close-packing. In fact,
our results provide a well-defined meaning for ""random close-packing"" in terms
of the fraction of all phase space with inherent structures that jam. The
jamming threshold, Point J, occurring at zero temperature and applied stress
and at the random close-packing density, has properties reminiscent of an
ordinary critical point. As Point J is approached from higher packing
fractions, power-law scaling is found for many quantities. Moreover, near Point
J, certain quantities no longer self-average, suggesting the existence of a
length scale that diverges at J. However, Point J also differs from an ordinary
critical point: the scaling exponents do not depend on dimension but do depend
on the interparticle potential. Finally, as Point J is approached from high
packing fractions, the density of vibrational states develops a large excess of
low-frequency modes. All of these results suggest that Point J may control

typical transition metal ferromagnet nanoparticles drops below approximately
$10^4$, approximately where the single-particle level spacing, $\delta$,
becomes larger than, $\sqrt{\alpha} E_{\rm res}$, where $E_{\rm res}$ is the
ferromagnetic resonance frequency and $\alpha$ is the Gilbert damping
parameter. We illustrate our ideas by studying the properties of semi-realistic
model Hamiltonians, which we solve numerically for nanoparticles containing
several hundred atoms. For small nanoparticles, we find one isolated
ferromagnetic resonance collective mode below the lowest particle-hole
excitation energy, at $E_{\rm res} \approx 0.1$ meV. The spectral weight of
this pure excitation nearly exhausts the transverse dynamical susceptibility
spectral weight. As $\delta$ approaches $\sqrt{\alpha} E_{\rm res}$, the
ferromagnetic collective excitation is more likely to couple strongly with
discrete particle-hole excitations. In this regime the distinction between the
two types of excitations blurs. We discuss the significance of this picture for
the interpretation of recent single-electron tunneling experiments.

interfaces could be the source of the observed preference for particular angles
between neighbouring helices as emerging from statistical analysis of protein
databanks. Several elegant models describing how side chains on helices can
interdigitate without steric clashes were able to account quite reasonably for
the observed distributions. However, it was later recognized (Bowie, 1997 and
Walther, 1998) that the ``bare'' measured angle distribution should be
corrected to avoid statistical bias. Disappointingly, the rescaled
distributions dramatically lost their similarity with theoretical predictions
casting many doubts on the validity of the geometrical assumptions and models.
In this report we elucidate a few points concerning the proper choice of the
random reference distribution. In particular we show the existence of crucial
corrections due to the correct implementation of the approach used to
discriminate whether two helices are in contact or not and to measure their
relative orientations. By using this new rescaling, the ``true'' packing angle
preferences are well described, even more than with the original ``bare''
distribution, by regular packing models.

very strong fractionation effects are observed for parent polydispersities

are completely dominated by respectively the shortest and the longest rods in

  operations and classical communication","4 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present a method of determining important properties of a shared bipartite
quantum state, within the ``distant labs'' paradigm, using \emph{only} local
operations and classical communication (LOCC). We apply this procedure to
spectrum estimation of shared states, and locally implementable structural
physical approximations to incompletely positive maps. This procedure can also
be applied to the estimation of channel capacity and measures of entanglement.

  20 Mar 2003",,,,"quant-ph",,"  For the quantum Gaussian state family, Hayashi proposed a quantum mechanical
operation using beam splitters to estimate the location and scale parameters of
the P-function, and he showed that it is asymptotically optimal. In this paper,
we analyze the effect of disturbance of his operation caused by the randomness
of the transparency of the beam splitters. It is shown that even if the
variance of the random transparency is small, Hayashi's estimators are improper
in a sense that they are biased and asymptotically inconsistent. In such a
case, we propose to stop the operation and correct the biases of estimators.

operations and quadratic forms over binary vector spaces. We show how the
n-qubit Clifford group is isomorphic to a group with an operation that is
defined in terms of a (2n+1)x(2n+1) binary matrix product and binary quadratic
forms. As an application we give two schemes to efficiently decompose Clifford
group operations into one and two-qubit operations. We also show how the
coefficients of stabilizer states and Clifford group operations in a standard
basis expansion can be described by binary quadratic forms. Our results are
useful for quantum error correction, entanglement distillation and possibly
quantum computing.

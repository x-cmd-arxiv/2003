fluence-frequency relationship for these events. Fitting the log N-log S
distribution over several orders of magnitude to simple power law we find a
slope of -1.0. The sources of FXTs are undoubtedly heterogeneous, the -1 power
law is an approximate result of the summation of these multiple sources. Two
major contributions come from gamma-ray bursts and stellar flares.
Extrapolating from the BATSE catalog of GRBs, we find that the fraction of
X-ray flashes that can be the X-ray counterparts of gamma-ray bursts is a
function of fluence. Certainly most FXTs are not counterparts of standard
gamma-ray bursts. The fraction of FXTs from non-GRB sources, such as magnetic
stars, is greatest for the faintest FXTs. Our understanding of the FXT
phenomenon remains limited and would greatly benefit from a large, homogeneous
data set, which requires a wide-field, sensitive instrument.

both hydrodynamic acoustic waves and magnetosonic waves unstable. In addition,
magnetosonic waves can be driven unstable by a combination of the equilibrium

parabolic flows to prove geometric results. I will emphasise the fact that
there is a wide variety of geometric parabolic equations to choose from, and to
get the best results it can be very important to choose the best flow. I will
illustrate this in the setting of surfaces in a three-dimensional sphere. There
are quite a few relevant results for surfaces in the sphere satisfying various
kinds of curvature equations, including totally umbillic surfaces, minimal
surfaces and constant mean curvature surfaces, and intrinsically flat surfaces.
Parabolic flows can strengthen such results by allowing classes of surfaces
satisfying curvature inequalities rather than equalities: This was first done
by Huisken, who used mean curvature flow to deform certain classes of surfaces
to totally umbillic surfaces. This motivates the question ``What is the optimal
result of this kind?'' -- that is, what is the weakest pointwise curvature
condition which defines a class of surfaces which retracts to the space of
great spheres? The answer to this question can be guessed in view of the
examples. To prove it requires a surprising choice of evolution equation,
forced by the requirement that the pointwise curvature condition be preserved.
I will conclude by mentioning some other geometric situations in which strong
results can be proved by choosing the best possible evolution equation.

total mass of a spacetime which contains black holes with event horizons of
total area $A$ should be at least $\sqrt{A/16\pi}$. An important special case
of this physical statement translates into a very beautiful mathematical
inequality in Riemannian geometry known as the Riemannian Penrose inequality.
One particularly geometric aspect of this problem is the fact that apparent
horizons of black holes in this setting correspond to minimal surfaces in
Riemannian 3-manifolds. The Riemannian Penrose inequality was first proved by
G. Huisken and T. Ilmanen in 1997 for a single black hole \cite{HI} and then by
the author in 1999 for any number of black holes \cite{Bray}. The two
approaches use two different geometric flow techniques. The most general
version of the Penrose inequality is still open. In this talk we will sketch
the author's proof by flowing Riemannian manifolds inside the class of
asymptotically flat 3-manifolds (asymptotic to $\real^3$ at infinity) which
have nonnegative scalar curvature and contain minimal spheres. This new flow of
metrics has very special properties and simulates an initial physical situation
in which all of the matter falls into the black holes which merge into a
single, spherically symmetric black hole given by the Schwarzschild metric.
Since the Schwarzschild metric gives equality in the Penrose inequality and the
flow decreases the total mass while preserving the area of the horizons of the
black holes, the Penrose inequality follows. We will also discuss how these
techniques can be generalized in higher dimensions.

singular fibration structure on collapsed manifolds. However, new techniques
have been introduced and tools from related fields have been brought in. As a
consequence, light has been shed on some classical problems and conjectures
whose statements do not involve collapsing. Specifically, substantial progress
has been made on manifolds with nonpositive curvature, on positively pinched
manifolds, collapsed manifolds with an a priori diameter bound, and subclasses
of manifolds whose members satisfy additional topological conditions e.g.

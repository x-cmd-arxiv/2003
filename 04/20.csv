higher that that obtained by XMM observatory on Feb 10.7 2003. This could imply

conductance between the grains, $g_T\gg 1$. We show that at low temperatures,
$T\leq g_T\delta $, where $\delta$ is the single mean energy level spacing in a
grain, the coherent electron motion at large distances dominates the physics,
contrary to the high temperature ($T>g_T\delta $) behavior where conductivity
is controlled by the scales of the order of the grain size. The conductivity of
one and two dimensional granular metals, in the low temperature regime, decays
with decreasing temperature in the same manner as that in homogeneous
disordered metals, indicating thus an insulating behavior. However, even in
this temperature regime the granular structure remains important and there is
an additional contribution to conductivity coming from short distances. Due to
this contribution the metal-insulator transition in three dimensions occurs at
the value of tunnel conductance $g_T^C=(1/6\pi)\ln (E_C/\delta)$, where $E_C$
is the charging energy of an isolated grain, and not at the generally expected
$g_T^C\propto 1$. Corrections to the density of states of granular metals due
to the electron-electron interaction are calculated. Our results compare
favorably with the logarithmic dependence of resistivity in the high-$T_c$
cuprate superconductors indicating that these materials may have a granular

that the bosonic part of these solutions are invariant under T-duality, while

Phys. 119, 3336-3342 (2003)","10.1063/1.1588991",,"physics.chem-ph physics.atm-clus",,"  The density of states and other thermodynamic functions of helium
nanodroplets are calculated for a microcanonical ensemble with both energy and
total angular momentum treated as conserved quantum numbers. These functions
allow angular momentum conserving evaporative cooling simulations.
  As part of this project, a recursion relationship is derived for the
reduction to irreducible representations of the n'th symmetric power of the
irreducible representations of the rotation group. These give the distribution
of total angular momentum states generated by putting multiple quanta into a
ripplon or phonon mode of the droplet, each of which is characterized by a
angular momentum quantum number.

$H^{2k-1}$, $1 \leqslant k \leqslant n$, on a symplectic manifold $({\cal
M}^{2n},\omega)$ are given and studied. For $k = 1$ and $k = n$, they are
isomorphic to the corresponding de Rham cohomology groups $H_{dR}^1({\cal
M}^{2n})$ and $H_{dR}^{2n-1}({\cal M}^{2n})$, respectively. The other
Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups are different from either the de Rham
cohomology groups or the harmonic cohomology groups on $({\cal
M}^{2n},\omega)$, in general. The general volume-preserving equations on
$({\cal M}^{2n},\omega)$ are also presented from cohomological point of view.
In the special cases, these equations become the ordinary canonical equations
in the Hamilton mechanics. Therefore, the Hamilton mechanics has been
generalized via the cohomology.

replacing one of the single photon inputs by a coherent state.

of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we expect quantum field computation to
contain (non-relativistic) quantum computation. Although we do not yet have a
quantum theory of the gravitational field, and are far from a practical
implementation of a quantum field computer, some pieces of the puzzle (without
gravity) are now available. We consider a general model for computation with
quantum field theory, and obtain some results for relativistic quantum
computation. Moreover, it is possible to see new connections between principal
models of computation, namely, computation over the continuum and computation
over the integers (Turing computation). Thus we identify a basic problem in
QFT, namely Wightman's computation problem for domains of holomorphy, which we
call WHOLO. Inspired by the same analytic functions which are central to the
famous CPT theorem of QFT, it is possible to obtain a computational complexity
structure for QFT and shed new light on certain complexity classes for this
problem WHOLO.

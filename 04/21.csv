consistent with earlier ROSAT observations. We find a sharp edge or
discontinuity in the radial surface brightness profile 55 kpc E and SE of NGC
507 covering a $\sim125^\circ$ arc. At the sharpest part of the discontinuity,
the surface brightness declines by a factor of $\sim$2 over a distance of 6.9

that there is a large gradient in the elemental abundance across the

that the discontinuity is aligned with a low surface brightness radio lobe. We
conclude that the appearance of this discontinuity is the result of the
transport of high abundance material from the center of the galaxy by the
expanding radio lobe, similar to structures seen in {\em Chandra} observations

coincident with the outer half of the southwest radio lobe, and a bright X-ray
enhancement is detected along the edge of the lobe. On the basis of energetic
and lifetime arguments, we reject a nonthermal explanation for this emission.
We model this emission as a thin, hot shell or cap of X-ray emitting plasma
surrounding the radio lobe that was created by the supersonic inflation of the
lobe. This plasma shell is both hotter than ($k_BT_{SH}\sim$2.9 keV) and
greatly overpressurized relative to the ambient ISM indicating supersonic
expansion. We estimate that the lobe is expanding into the ISM at approximately
Mach 8.5 or 2400 km s$^{-1}$. We are not directly observing the bow shock, but
rather the cooler, denser material that is accumulating ahead of the contact
discontinuity. The thermal energy in the shell is a significant fraction of the
thermal energy of the hot ISM, demonstrating the possibility that the hot ISM
of early galaxies can be re-energized by outflows from nuclear activity.
Interestingly, no similarly bright X-ray emission is detected in or along the
edge of the NE lobe, implying that there are differences in the dynamics and
evolution of the kpc-scale radio components.

are investigated using first-principles density-functional theory within the
local density approximation.
  Interfaces between fcc Cu and $\alpha$-cristobalite(001) surfaces with
different surface stoichiometries are considered.
  Interfacial properties are found to be sensitive to the choice of the
termination, and the oxygen density at the substrate surface is the most
important factor influencing the strength of adhesion.
  For oxygen-rich interfaces, the O atoms at the interface substantially
rearrange after the deposition of Cu layers, suggesting the formation of Cu-O
bonds.
  Significant hybridization between Cu$-d$ and O$-p$ states is evident in
site-projected density of states at the interface.
  As oxygen is systematically removed from the interface, less rearrangement is
observed, implying weaker adhesion.
  Computed adhesion energies for each of the interfaces are found to reflect
these observed structural and bonding trends, leading to the largest adhesion
energy in the oxygen rich cases.
  The adhesion energy is also calculated between Cu and SiO$_2$ substrates
terminated with hydroxyl groups, and adhesion of Cu to these substrates is
found to be considerably reduced.
  This work supports the notion that Cu films can adhere well to hydroxyl-free
  SiO$_2$ substrates should oxygen be present in sufficient amounts at the

In this paper, the neutron stars are assumed to be filled with neutron and
proton superfluids and the strength of the entrainment effects between the
superfluids are represented by a single parameter $\eta$. We find that the
basic properties of the $r$-modes in a relativistic superfluid star are very
similar to those found for a Newtonian superfluid star. The $r$-modes of a
relativistic superfluid star are split into two families, ordinary fluid-like
$r$-modes ($r^o$-mode) and superfluid-like $r$-modes ($r^s$-mode). The two
superfluids counter-move for the $r^s$-modes, while they co-move for the
$r^o$-modes. For the $r^o$-modes, the quantity $\kappa\equiv\sigma/\Omega+m$ is
almost independent of the entrainment parameter $\eta$, where $m$ and $\sigma$
are the azimuthal wave number and the oscillation frequency observed by an
inertial observer at spatial infinity, respectively. For the $r^s$-modes, on
the other hand, $\kappa$ almost linearly increases with increasing $\eta$. It
is also found that the radiation driven instability due to the $r^s$-modes is
much weaker than that of the $r^o$-modes because the matter current associated
with the axial parity perturbations almost completely vanishes.

insensitive to soft radiation for $Q^{2}\lesssim m^{2}$ at energies of the

excellent test of pQCD applicability to heavy flavor production.

unit ``node capacities'' the blocking skew-symmetric flow algorithm has time
bounds similar to those established in Even and Tarjan (1975) and Karzanov

finding a maximum matching in a nonbipartite graph in $O(\sqrt{n}m)$ time,

extending a clique compression technique of Feder and Motwani to particular

studied in the limit of strongly local interactions where the usual kinetic
equation, describing the time evolution of the spectral wave-action density,
can be approximated by a PDE. If the wave action is initially compactly
supported in frequency space, it is then redistributed by resonant interactions
producing the usual direct and inverse cascades, leading to the formation of
the K-Z spectra. The emphasis here is on the direct cascade. The evolution
proceeds by the formation of a self-similar front which propagates to the right
leaving a quasi-stationary state in its wake. This front is sharp in the sense
that the solution remains compactly supported until it reaches infinity. If the
energy spectrum has infinite capacity, the front takes infinite time to reach
infinite frequency and leaves the K-Z spectrum in its wake. On the other hand,
if the energy spectrum has finite capacity, the front reaches infinity within a
finite time, t*, and the wake is steeper than the K-Z spectrum. For this case,
the K-Z spectrum is set up from the right after the front reaches infinity. The
slope of the solution in the wake can be related to the speed of propagation of
the front. It is shown that the anomalous slope in the finite capacity case
corresponds to the unique front speed which ensures that the front tip contains
a finite amount of energy as the connection to infinity is made. We also
introduce, for the first time, the notion of entropy production in wave
turbulence and show how it evolves as the system approaches the stationary K-Z
spectrum.

self-similarity it is possible to use dimensional arguments to derive the
scaling exponents of the Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectra, provided the order of the
resonant wave interactions responsible for nonlinear energy transfer is known.
Furthermore one can easily derive conditions for the breakdown of the weak
turbulence approximation. It is found that for incompletely self-similar
systems dominated by three wave interactions, the weak turbulence approximation
usually cannot break down at small scales. It follows that such systems cannot
exhibit small scale intermittency. For systems dominated by four wave
interactions, the incomplete self-similarity property implies that the scaling
of the interaction coefficient depends only on the physical dimension of the
system. These results are used to build a complete picture of the scaling
properties of the surface wave problem where both gravity and surface tension
play a role. We argue that, for large values of the energy flux, there should
be two weakly turbulent scaling regions matched together via a region of
strongly nonlinear turbulence.

calls. If $F$ is one-to-one and the size of its domain and range is the same,
then our problem can be formulated as follows: Given an oracle $f(a,x):
\{0,1\}^n\times\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ and a fixed (but hidden) value $a_0$, we
wish to obtain the value of $a_0$ by querying the oracle $f(a_0,x)$. Our goal
is to minimize the number of such oracle calls (the query complexity) using a
quantum mechanism.
  Two popular oracles are the EQ-oracle defined as $f(a,x)=1$ iff $x=a$ and the
IP-oracle defined as $f(a,x)= a\cdot x \mod 2$. It is also well-known that the
query complexity is $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ ($N=2^n$) for the EQ-oracle while only
O(1) for the IP-oracle. The main purpose of this paper is to fill this gap or
to investigate what causes this large difference. To do so, we introduce a
parameter $K$ as the maximum number of 1's in a single column of $T_f$ where
$T_f$ is the $N\times N$ truth-table of the oracle $f(a,x)$. Our main result
shows that the (quantum) query complexity is heavily governed by this parameter
$K$: ($i$) The query complexity is $\Omega(\sqrt{N/K})$. ($ii$) This lower
bound is tight in the sense that we can construct an explicit oracle whose
query complexity is $O(\sqrt{N/K})$. ($iii$) The tight complexity,
$\Theta(\frac{N}{K}+\log{K})$, is also obtained for the classical case. Thus,
the quantum algorithm needs a quadratically less number of oracle calls when
$K$ is small and this merit becomes larger when $K$ is large, e.g., $\log{K}$

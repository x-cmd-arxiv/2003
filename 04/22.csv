transients and active galactic nuclei. In our model, the inner part of the
accretion disk around the central black hole switches between two states. In
one state, the accretion energy is dissipated locally (some within the disk,
some within a corona) to produce the observed disk luminosity. In the second
state, the accretion energy is deposited into the bulk flow of a relativistic
jet. We associate the transition between the two states with the generation of
a global, poloidal magnetic field. We show that this model can explain the
observed behavior of black hole accretors.

information about the primordial fluctuation-generator, be it inflation or
something else. The tensor perturbation spectrum may be observable through its
influence on CMB polarization, but only if the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r = T/S,
is greater than about 10^{-5}. The tensor tilt can be measured with an error of
sigma(n_T) that decreases with r from 0.1 at r=0.001 to 0.02 at r = 0.1.
Current CMB constraints on the scalar perturbation spectrum can be improved by
higher--resolution CMB observations and/or by tomographic cosmic shear
observations. These can both shrink errors on the tilt (n_S) and running (n_S'=
dn_S/d\ln k) to the 10^{-3} level. Stunning as these results would be, it may
become very desirable to improve upon them an order of magnitude further in
order to study the expected departures from n_S' = 0. Such improvements are
likely to require observation of three--dimensional clustering over very large
volumes. Unfortunately, to get down to the 10^{-4} level will require a sparse
spectroscopic redshift survey with about 10^9 galaxies spread over a volume
less than but comparable to that of the observable Universe.

naturally explain the present-day properties of these systems. This model
invokes a donor star that was either very close to the TAMS (i.e.,

evolve during the mass-transfer phase. We have run a systematic set of detailed
binary evolution calculations with a wide range of initial donor masses and
degrees of (nuclear) evolution at the onset of mass transfer. In general, the
models whose evolutionary tracks result in the best fits to these ultracompact
binaries start mass transfer with orbital periods of ~15 hr, then decrease to a
minimum orbital period of less than or about 40 minutes, and finally evolve
back up to about 43 minutes. We also carry out a probability analysis based on
the measured mass functions of XTE J0929-314 and XTE J1751-305, and combine

to be factors of about 1.1 - 1.3 times larger than the corresponding

Digital Sky Survey, SDSS J092455.87+021924.9 (SDSS J0924+0219). This object was
selected from among known SDSS quasars by an algorithm that was designed to
select another known SDSS lensed quasar (SDSS 1226-0006A,B). Five separate
components, three of which are unresolved, are identified in photometric
follow-up observations obtained with the Magellan Consortium's 6.5m Walter
Baade telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Two of the unresolved components
(designated A and B) are confirmed to be quasars with z=1.524; the velocity
difference is less than 100 km sec^{-1} according to spectra taken with the W.
M. Keck Observatory's Keck II telescope on Mauna Kea. A third stellar
component, designated C, has the colors of a quasar with redshift similar to
components A and B. The maximum separation of the point sources is 1.78"". The
other two sources, designated G and D, are resolved. Component G appears to be
the best candidate for the lensing galaxy. Although component D is near the
expected position of the fourth lensed component in a four image lens system,
its properties are not consistent with being the image of a quasar at z~1.5.
Nevertheless, the identical redshifts of components A and B and the presence of
component C strongly suggest that this object is a gravitational lens. Our
observations support the idea that a foreground object reddens the fourth
lensed component and that another unmodeled effect (such as micro- or
milli-lensing) demagnificates it, but we cannot rule out the possibility that
SDSS0924+0219 is an example of the relatively rare class of ``three component''
lens systems.

Furthermore, the mass-concentration relation is correctly reproduced at any
redshift in all the hierarchical cosmologies analyzed, except for very large
halo masses. The role of major mergers, which can cause the rearrangement of
the halo structure through violent relaxation, is also investigated. We show
that, as a result of the boundary conditions imposed by the matter continuously
infalling into the halo during the violent relaxation process, the shape of the
density profile emerging from major mergers is essentially identical to the
shape the halo would have developed through pure accretion. This result
explains why, according to high-resolution cosmological simulations, relaxed
halos of a given mass have the same density profile regardless of whether they
have had a recent merger or not, and why both spherical infall and hierarchical
assembly lead to very similar density profiles. Finally, we demonstrate that
the density profile of relaxed halos is not affected either by the capture of
clumps of intermediate mass.

velocity, and mass distribution. Average particle sizes are 0.5 to $\rm 1 \mu

decreasing numbers towards bigger particles. Our results imply that the
particles have been kicked up by hypervelocity impacts of micrometeoroids onto
the satellites' surfaces. The measured radial dust density profiles are
consistent with predictions by dynamical modeling for satellite ejecta produced
by interplanetary impactors (Krivov et al., PSS, 2003, 51, 251--269), assuming
yield, mass and velocity distributions of the ejecta from laboratory
measurements. The dust clouds of the three outer Galilean moons have very
similar properties and are in good agreement with the model predictions for
solid ice-silicate surfaces. The dust density in the vicinity of Io, however,
is more than an order of magnitude lower than expected from theory. This may be
due to a softer, fluffier surface of Io (volcanic deposits) as compared to the
other moons. The log-log slope of the dust number density in the clouds vs.
distance from the satellite center ranges between --1.6 and --2.8. Appreciable
variations of number densities obtained from individual flybys with varying

into the brown dwarf (BD) regime is in good agreement with observations and
yields a disk BD number-density comparable to the stellar one $\sim 0.1 \pc3$.
The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF,
providing the same correction for unresolved binaries. The spheroid IMF relies
on much less robust grounds. Within all the uncertainties, it is found to be
similar to the one derived for globular clusters, and is well represented also
by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the
disk. The IMF characteristic of early star formation remains undetermined, but
different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below $\sim
1 \msol$. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic
present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have
important galactic implications in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio
determinations. The M/L ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF
yield values 1.8 and 1.4 smaller than a Salpeter IMF, respectively. This

determine the nature of the sources and theinterstellar extinction. We have
observed about 16 square degrees with a sensitivity approaching 10-20mJy,
detecting ~10^5 sources,mostly AGB stars,red giants and young stars. The main
features of the ISOGAL survey and the observations are summarized in this
paper,together with a brief discussion of data processing and quality. The
primary ISOGAL products are described briefly (a full description is given in
Schuller et al. 2003, astro-ph/0304309): viz. the images and theISOGAL-DENIS
five-wavelength point source catalogue. The main scientific results already
derived or in progress are summarized. These include astrometrically calibrated
7 and 15um images,determining structures of resolved sources; identification
and properties of interstellar dark clouds; quantification of the infrared
extinction law and source dereddening; analysis of red giant and (especially)
AGB stellar populations in the central Bulge,determining luminosity,presence of
circumstellar dust and mass--loss rate,and source classification,supplemented
in some cases by ISO/CVF spectroscopy; detection of young stellar objects of
diverse types,especially in the inner Bulge with information about the present
and recent star formation rate; identification of foreground sources with
mid-IR excess. These results are the subject of about 25 refereed papers
published or in preparation.

general considerations, we suggest that the phenomenonn is associated with
interactions that keep electrons at some particular, finite distance (r_{0}),
and occurs at a range of intermediate densities (n\sim 1/r_{0}^{3}). We discuss
the ground state and the critical temperature in the framework of a standard
functional-integral theory of the BCS to Bose crossover. We find that, due to
the lower energy of two-body bound states with (l=0), the rotational symmetry
of the ground state is always restored on approaching the Bose limit. Moreover
in that limit the critical temperature is always higher for pairs with (l=0.)
The breaking of the rotational symmetry of the continuum by the superfluid
state thus seems to be a property of weakly-attractive, non-monotonic
interaction potentials, at intermediate densities.

fit predicts a small Higgs boson mass, $m_H=45$ GeV, that is inconsistent at
95% CL with the lower limit, $m_H>114$ GeV, established by direct searches. The
data then favor new physics if the anomalous measurements are both excluded or
both retained, and the Higgs boson mass cannot be predicted until the new
physics is understood. The validity of the SM could however be maintained by a
propitious combination of statistical fluctuation and systematic error. The
current data do not allow a definitive conclusion.

more general, even fractal attractors. This could lead to Big Mess scenarios in
applications to multiphase systems, from spin-glasses and neural networks to
fundamental string (M?) theory. We consider various general aspects of such
chaotic flows. We argue that they pose no obvious contradictions with the known
properties of effective actions, the existence of dissipative Lyapunov
functions, and even the strong version of the c-theorem. We also explain the
difficulties encountered when constructing effective actions with chaotic

determined by integrating over Wilson loops only, not over surface fluctuations

from loop fluctuations as well as integration over finite -thickness
center-vortex collective coordinates. In d=3 (or d=2+1) we exploit a contour
form of the extremal area in isothermal which is similar to d=2 (or d=1+1) QCD
in many respects, except that there are both quartic and quadratic terms in the
action. One major result is that at large angular momentum \ell in d=3+1 the
center-vortex extremal-area picture yields a linear Regge trajectory with Regge
slope--string tension product \alpha'(0)K_F of 1/(2\pi), which is the canonical
Veneziano/string value. In a curious effect traceable to retardation, the quark
kinetic terms in the action vanish relative to area-law terms in the large-\ell
limit, in which light-quark masses \sim K_F^{1/2} are negligible. This
corresponds to string-theoretic expectations, even though we emphasize that the
extremal-area law is not a string theory quantum-mechanically. We show how some
quantum trajectory fluctuations as well as non-leading classical terms for
finite mass yield corrections scaling with \ell^{-1/2}. We compare to old
semiclassical calculations of relativistic q\bar{q} bound states at large \ell,
which also yield asymptotically-linear Regge trajectories, finding agreement
with a naive string picture (classically, not quantum-mechanically) and
disagreement with an effective-propagator model. We show that contour forms of
the area law can be expressed in terms of Abelian gauge potentials, and relate

ideas from algebraic geometry. The definition is largely motivated by the
structures utilized in the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata (BMS) decoding algorithm,
with Feng-Rao majority voting for unknown syndromes, applied to one-point
geometric Goppa codes constructed from curves. However, order domains are much
more general, and O'Sullivan has shown that the BMS algorithm can be applied to
decode all codes constructed from order domains by a suitable generalization of
Goppa's procedure for curves. In this article we will first discuss the
connection between order domains and valuations on function fields over a
finite field. Under some mild conditions, we will see that a general projective
variety over a finite field has projective models which can be used to
construct order domains and Goppa-type codes for which the BMS algorithm is
applicable. We will then give a slightly different interpretation of Geil and
Pellikaan's extrinsic characterization of order domains via the theory of
Gr\""obner bases, and show that their results are related to the existence of
toric deformations of varieties. To illustrate the potential usefulness of
these observations, we present a series of new explicit examples of order
domains associated to varieties with many rational points over finite fields:

so. Much of the development is driven by the tantalizing analogy with mapping
class groups. Unfortunately, $Out(F_n)$ is more complicated and less
well-behaved. Culler and Vogtmann constructed Outer Space $X_n$, the analog of
Teichm\""uller space, a contractible complex on which $Out(F_n)$ acts with
finite stabilizers. Paths in $X_n$ can be generated using ``foldings'' of
graphs, an operation introduced by Stallings to give alternative solutions for
many algorithmic questions about free groups. The most conceptual proof of the
contractibility of $X_n$ involves folding. There is a normal form of an
automorphism, analogous to Thurston's normal form for surface homeomorphisms.
This normal form, called a ``(relative) train track map'', consists of a
cellular map on a graph and has good properties with respect to iteration. One
may think of building an automorphism in stages, adding to the previous stages
a building block that either grows exponentially or polynomially. A
complicating feature is that these blocks are not ``disjoint'' as in Thurston's
theory, but interact as upper stages can map over the lower stages.
Applications include the study of growth rates (a surprising feature of free

ring of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. Around the same time, Harer proved
that the homology of the mapping class groups of oriented surfaces is
independent of the genus in low degrees, increasing with the genus. The
(co)homology of mapping class groups thus stabelizes. At least rationally, the
mapping class groups have the same (co)homology as the corresponding moduli
spaces. This prompted Mumford to conjecture that the stable rational cohomology
of moduli spaces is generated by certain tautological classes that he defines.
Much of the recent interest in this subject is motivated by mathematical
physics and, in particular, by string theory. The study of the category of
strings led to the discovery of an infinite loop space, the cohomology of which
is the stable cohomology of the mapping class groups. We explain here a
homotopy theoretic approach to Mumford's conjecture based on this fact. As
byproducts infinite families of torsion classes in the stable cohomology are
detected, and the divisibility of the tautological classes is determined. An
analysis of the category of strings in a background space leads to the
formulization of a parametrized version of Mumford's conjecture.
  The paper is chiefly a summary of the author's work and her collaboration
with Ib Madsen. Earlier this year Madsen and Weiss announced a solution of
Mumford's conjecture. We touch on some of the consequences and the ideas behind
this most exciting new developement.

cyclostrophic and hydrostatic. This is a regime dominated by so-called pancake
vortices, with only a weak excitation of internal gravity waves and large
values of the local Richardson number, Ri, everywhere. At higher values of R
there are successive transitions to (a) overturning motions with local
reversals in the density stratification and small or negative values of Ri; (b)
growth of a horizontally uniform vertical shear flow component; and (c) growth
of a large-scale vertical flow component. Throughout these transitions, pancake

limit is the zeroth-order approximation. As an application of this formulation,
non-adiabatic correction or error is estimated for several physical
implementations of the adiabatic geometric gates. A quantum computing process
consisting of many adiabatic gate operations is considered, for which the total
non-adiabatic error is found to be about the sum of those of all the gates.
This is a useful constraint on the computational power. The formalism is also
briefly applied to the adiabatic quantum algorithm.

choice of a complex structure on C. When the latter is a complex-analytic
manifold admitting just one complex structure, there is a unique quantisation
whose classical limit is C. Then the notion of coherence is the same for all
observers. However, when C admits two or more nonbiholomorphic complex
structures, there is one different quantisation per different complex structure
on C. The lack of analyticity in transforming between nonbiholomorphic complex
structures can be interpreted as the loss of quantum-mechanical coherence under
the corresponding transformation. Observers using one complex structure
perceive as coherent the states that other observers, using a different complex
structure, do not perceive as such. This is the notion of a quantum-mechanical
duality transformation: the relativity of the notion of a quantum.

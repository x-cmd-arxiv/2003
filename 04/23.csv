  Astrophysics; figures rescaled, typos corrected",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We report on a study of tidally triggered star formation in galaxies, based
on spectroscopic/photometric observations in the optical/near-IR of a magnitude
limited sample of 59 systems of interacting and merging galaxies and a
comparison sample of 38 normal isolated galaxies. In contrast to results from
previous investigations, our global UBV colours do not support a significant
enhancement of starforming activity in the interacting/merging galaxies. We
claim that this is true also for Arp galaxies. A moderate increase in star
formation is found in the very centres of the interacting galaxies contributing
marginally to the total luminosity. The interacting and in particular the
merging galaxies are characterized by increased far infrared (hereafter FIR)
luminosities and temperatures that weakly correlate with the central activity.
The L(FIR)/L(B) ratio however, is remarkably similar in the two samples,
indicating that true starbursts normally are not hiding in the central regions
of the FIR luminous cases. The gas mass-to-luminosity ratio in optical-IR is
practically independent of luminosity, lending further support to the paucity
of true massive starburst galaxies triggered by interactions/mergers. Our
conclusion is that interacting and merging galaxies, from the global star
formation aspect, generally do not differ dramatically from scaled up versions
of normal, isolated galaxies. No drastic change with redshift is expected.

equations that are different from those arising by merely coupling an
``isothermal sphere'' to the Lambda-field within a Newtonian framework. The
conditions for the existence and stability of circular geodesic orbits show the
existence of (I) an ``isothermal region'' (0<r<r_2), circular orbits are stable
and all variables behave almost identically to those of an isothermal sphere;
(II) an ``asymptotic region'' (r>r_1) dominated by the Lambda-field, where the
Newtonian potential oscillates and circular orbits exist in disconnected
patches of the domain of r; (III) a ``transition region'' (r_2<r<r_1), circular
orbits exist but are unstable. We also find that no stable configuration exists
with central density, rho_c, smaller than 2 Lambda, hence any galactic haloes
which virialized at $z< 30$ in must have rho_c >0.008 M_\odot {pc}^3, in
agreement with rotation curve studies of dwarf galaxies. Since r_2 marks the
largest radius of a stable circular orbit, it provides a ``cut off'' radius.
For current estimates of rho_c and velocity dispersion of galactic structures,
this is around five times larger than the virialization radius. The effects of
the Lambda$--field can hence be ignored in structure formation models, but
could be significant in the dynamics of superclusters in the linear regime or
of gravitational clustering at large scales.

stellar cores are created from the binding energy liberated by shrinking
supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. The binary orbital decay heats the
surrounding stars, eroding a preexisting 1/r^2 stellar cusp. We follow the
merger history of dark matter halos and associated SMBHs via cosmological Monte
Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times to the present in a
LCDM cosmology. Massive black holes get incorporated through a series of
mergers into larger and larger halos, sink to the center owing to dynamical
friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become
supermassive, and form a binary system. Stellar dynamical processes drive the
binary to harden and eventually coalesce. A simple scheme is applied in which
the loss cone is constantly refilled and a constant density core forms due to
the ejection of stellar mass. We find that a model in which the effect of the
hierarchy of SMBH interactions is cumulative and cores are preserved during
galaxy mergers produces at the present epoch a correlation between the `mass
deficit' (the mass needed to bring a flat inner density profile to a 1/r^2
cusp) and the mass of the nuclear SMBH, with a normalization and slope
comparable to the observed relation. Models in which the mass displaced by the
SMBH binary is replenished after every major galaxy merger appear instead to
underestimate the mass deficit observed in `core' galaxies.

precise measurement of the relative velocity obtained from simultaneous
observations of individual events. While an array of telescopes spread over an

face-on and edge-on aspect of 0.9, 0.3 and 0.1 magnitudes in I (0.81 um), J

simple linear extinction law (i.e. Delta M = gamma log(a/b)) is not adequate
for the full range of disk inclinations and we adopt both a bi-linear and a
quadratic law. A simple photometric model is used to explain the observed
behavior. Internal extinction depends on galaxy luminosity. We show that for
galaxies with a K total magnitude dimmer than -20, -20.7 and -20.9 the data
indicates zero extinction in J, H and K respectively, while disk opacity

seen by the narrow emission-line gas is significantly higher than that

range in hydrogen density (10^2-10^6 cm^-3) to reproduce the measured

the low polarization equatorial regions. For IRAS 17150-3224, circumstellar
arcs are seen at 1.6 um, along with a newly-discovered loop in the equatorial

spectrum of UM425A (the brighter component) is well-fit with a power law
(photon spectral index Gamma=2.0) partially covered by a hydrogen column of
3.8x10^22 cm^-2. The underlying power-law slope for this object and for other
recent samples of BALQSOs is typical of radio-quiet quasars, lending credence
to the hypothesis that BALs exist in every quasar. Assuming the same Gamma for
the much fainter image of UM425B, we detect an obscuring column 5 times larger.
We search for evidence of an appropriately large lensing mass in our Chandra
image and find weak diffuse emission near the quasar pair, with an X-ray flux
typical of a group of galaxies at redshift z ~ 0.6. From our analysis of
archival HST WFPC2 and NICMOS images, we find no evidence for a luminous
lensing galaxy, but note a 3-sigma excess of galaxies in the UM425 field with
plausible magnitudes for a z=0.6 galaxy group. However, the associated X-ray
emission does not imply sufficient mass to produce the observed image
splitting. The lens scenario thus requires a dark (high M/L ratio) lens, or a
fortuitous configuration of masses along the line of sight. UM425 may instead
be a close binary pair of BALQSOs, which would boost arguments that
interactions and mergers increase nuclear activity and outflows.

examine environmental dependence of color gradients in elliptical galaxies. We
studied the distribution of the B-R color gradients in the cluster ellipticals
and found that the mean value of the color gradients is -0.09 +- 0.04 mag/dex,
which can be converted to a metallicity gradient (dlogZ/dlogr) of ~ -0.3 +- 0.1
assuming an old stellar population. We further studied the relations between
the B-R color gradients and global properties of the galaxies. Our data suggest
that for the galaxies brighter than L*, more luminous and larger galaxies tend
to have steeper color gradients. The typical value of the color gradients seems
to be consistent with a recent monolithic collapse model and the correlation
could also appear if elliptical galaxies formed through the monolithic
collapse. On the contrary, it is found based on data from the literature that
any such trend is clearly weaker for ellipticals in less dense environments,
while the distribution of the color gradients is quite similar to that found in

EIS J0533-2412 is a rich system (Lambda_cl=299), with a spectroscopically
confirmed redshift of z=1.3. Both galaxy concentrations show firm X-ray
detections, located within 30"" of their optical center. However, we cannot

measurement of the color spread of red giant stars in Carina based on new BVI
wide-field observations, and model the width of the RGB by means of synthetic
color-magnitude diagrams. The measured color spread, Sigma{V-I}=0.021 +/-
0.005, is quite naturally accounted for by the star-formation history of the
galaxy. The thin RGB appears to be essentially related to the limited age range
of its dominant stellar populations, with no need for a metallicity dispersion
at a given age. This result is relatively robust with respect to changes in the
assumed age-metallicity relation, as long as the mean metallicity over the
galaxy lifetime matches the observed value ([Fe/H] = -1.91 +/- 0.12 after
correction for the age effects). This analysis of photometric data also sets
some constraints on the chemical evolution of Carina by indicating that the

strong Coulomb interactions in the nanotube. We treat back-scattering in the
contacts perturbatively and use the Keldysh formalism to treat non-equilibrium

include the effects of possible ferromagnetic polarization of the leads to
describe spin transport in carbon nanotubes. We thereby describe both
incoherent spin injection and coherent resonant spin transport between the two
leads. Spin currents can be produced in both ways, but only the latter allow
this spin current to be controlled using an external gate. In all cases, the
spin currents, charge currents, and magnetization of the nanotube exhibit
components varying quasiperiodically with bias voltage, approximately as a
superposition of periodic interference oscillations of spin- and

(CTRW) and Generalized Master Equation (GME). The walker, making instantaneous
jumps from one site of the lattice to another, resides in each site for
extended times. The sojourn times have a distribution psi(t) that is assumed to
be an inverse power law. We assume that the Onsager principle is fulfilled, and
we use this assumption to establish a complete equivalence between GME and the
Montroll-Weiss CTRW. We prove that this equivalence is confined to the case
when psi(t) is an exponential. We argue that is so because the Montroll-Weiss
CTRW, as recently proved by Barkai [E. Barkai, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 104101
(2003)], is non-stationary, thereby implying aging, while the Onsager
principle, is valid only in the case of fully aged systems. We consider the
case of a dichotomous fluctuation, and we prove that the Onsager principle is
fulfilled for any form of regression to equilibrium provided that the
stationary condition holds true. We set the stationary condition on both the
CTRW and the GME, thereby creating a condition of total equivalence, regardless
the nature of the waiting time distribution. As a consequence of this procedure
we create a GME that it is a ""bona fide"" master equation, in spite of being
non-Markovian. We note that the memory kernel of the GME affords information on
the interaction between system of interest and its bath. The Poisson case
yields a bath with infinitely fast fluctuations. We argue that departing from
the Poisson form has the effect of creating a condition of infinite memory and
that these results might be useful to shed light into the problem of how to
unravel non-Markovian master equations.

after its transfer onto a silicon substrate. One observes a film thickness of
4.6 nm, in good agreement with the X-ray penetration depth, about 4.5 nm. The

many-one reductions in exponential time. This result says that for language A
decidable in exponential time, either the class of languages reducible to A
(the lower span) or the class of problems to which A can be reduced (the upper
span) is small in the sense of resource-bounded measure and, in particular,
that the degree of A is small. Small span theorems have been proven for
increasingly stronger polynomial-time reductions, and a small span theorem for
polynomial-time Turing reductions would imply BPP != EXP. In contrast to the
progress in resource-bounded measure, Ambos-Spies, Merkle, Reimann, and Stephan
(2001) showed that there is no small span theorem for the resource-bounded
dimension of Lutz (2000), even for polynomial-time many-one reductions.
  Resource-bounded scaled dimension, recently introduced by Hitchcock, Lutz,
and Mayordomo (2003), provides rescalings of resource-bounded dimension. We use
scaled dimension to further understand the contrast between measure and
dimension regarding polynomial-time spans and degrees. We strengthen prior
results by showing that the small span theorem holds for polynomial-time
many-one reductions in the -3rd-order scaled dimension, but fails to hold in
the -2nd-order scaled dimension. Our results also hold in exponential space.
  As an application, we show that determining the -2nd- or -1st-order scaled
dimension in ESPACE of the many-one complete languages for E would yield a
proof of P = BPP or P != PSPACE. On the other hand, it is shown unconditionally
that the complete languages for E have -3rd-order scaled dimension 0 in ESPACE
and -2nd- and -1st-order scaled dimension 1 in E.

the different use of time ordered versus retarded Green functions. Subtle
questions concerning the precise definition of the equal time wave function
arise, because the wave function for the Coulomb gluon is discontinuous with
respect to the relative time of the gluon. A striking feature is that a one
loop non abelian graph contributes to the same order as tree graphs, because
the couplings of transverse gluons in the tree graphs are suppressed in the non
relativistic bound state, while the higher order loop graph can couple to
quarks via non suppressed Coulomb gluons. We also calculate the amplitude for
quark and antiquark at zero distance in the quark-glue-antiquark component of

models observationally. We argue that currently available data cannot exclude a
non-negligible contribution from cosmic strings definitively. We perform a
partial statistical analysis of mixed models that include a sub-dominant
contribution from cosmic strings. Although the data favor models without cosmic
strings, we conclude that they cannot definitively rule out a
cosmic-string-induced contribution of $\sim 10 %$ to the observed temperature,
polarization and galaxy density fluctuations. These results imply that $G\mu

dimensionless parameter related to the interstring distance, and $B$ measures
the importance of perturbations induced by cosmic strings. We argue that,
conservatively, the data available currently still permit $B\lesssim 0.1$.
Precision measurements sensitive to the B-mode polarization produced by vector
density perturbation modes driven by the string network could provide evidence
for these models. Accurate determinations of $n_s(k)$, the scalar fluctuation
index, could also distinguish among various brane inflation models.

natural differential equations can fail to have local solutions. A geometric
interpretation and a generalization of this counterexample were given in 1960
by L.H\""ormander. In the early seventies, L.Nirenberg and F.Treves proposed a
geometric condition on the principal symbol, the so-called condition $(\psi)$,
and provided strong arguments suggesting that it should be equivalent to local
solvability. The necessity of condition $(\psi)$ for solvability of
pseudo-differential equations was proved by L.H\""ormander in 1981. In 1994, it
was proved by N.L. that condition $(\psi)$ does not imply solvability with loss
of one derivative for pseudo-differential equations, contradicting repeated
claims by several authors. However in 1996, N.Dencker proved that these
counterexamples were indeed solvable, but with a loss of two derivatives. We
shall explore the structure of this phenomenon from both sides: on the one
hand, there are first-order pseudo-differential equations satisfying condition
$(\psi)$ such that no $L^2_{\text{loc}}$ solution can be found with some source
in $L^2_{\text{loc}}$. On the other hand, we shall see that, for these
examples, there exists a solution in the Sobolev space $H^{-1}_{\text{loc}}$.

property with respect to a given class of bimorphisms. We call the elements of
S(L_1,L_2) weak tensor products of L_1 and L_2. We prove that S(L_1,L_2) is a
complete lattice. We compare the bottom element with the separated product of
Aerts and with the box product of Graetzer and Wehrung. Similarly, we compare
the top element with the tensor products of Fraser, Chu and Shmuely. With some
additional hypotheses on L_1 and L_2 (true for instance if L_1 and L_2 are
moreover irreducible, orthocomplemented and with the covering property), we
characterize the automorphisms of weak tensor products in terms of those of L_1
and L_2.

using the flux correlation approach with a general form of the Boltzmannized
flux operator, which can simultaneously describe the Kubo and traditional
half-split forms. First, we consider an exactly solvable model, i.e., the free
particle case, in terms of a new scaling function. Next, as a non-trivial case,
we study the recombination and exchange reactions at very high pressure. Since
the rate constant is calculated by Laplace transform of the flux correlation
function, the result depends on how the Boltzmannized flux operator is chosen.
We find that a choice of the flux operator affects the rate constant
considerably. For the recombination reaction, the ratio of the rate constant in
the half-split form to that in the Kubo form approaches zero in the high
pressure limit.

cluster IC 348. We have obtained images at I and Z for a 42'x28' field
encompassing the cluster and have combined these measurements with previous
optical and near-infrared photometry. From spectroscopy of candidate cluster
members appearing in these data, we have identified 122 new members, 15 of
which have spectral types of M6.5-M9, corresponding to masses of 0.08-0.015
M_sun by recent evolutionary models. The latest census for IC 348 now contains
a total of 288 members, 23 of which are later than M6 and thus are likely to be
brown dwarfs. From an extinction-limited sample of members (A_V<=4) for a
16'x14' field centered on the cluster, we construct an IMF that is unbiased in
mass and nearly complete for M/M_sun>=0.03 (<=M8). In logarithmic units where
the Salpeter slope is 1.35, the mass function for IC 348 rises from high masses
down to a solar mass, rises more slowly down to a maximum at 0.1-0.2 M_sun, and
then declines into the substellar regime. In comparison, the similarly-derived
IMF for Taurus from Briceno et al. and Luhman et al. rises quickly to a peak
near 0.8 M_sun and steadily declines to lower masses. The distinctive shapes of
the IMFs in IC 348 and Taurus are reflected in the distributions of spectral
types, which peak at M5 and K7, respectively. These data provide compelling,
model-independent evidence for a significant variation of the IMF with
star-forming conditions.

Universe as a whole by using direct measurements of (relative) cosmic SFH from
high-redshift observations. These have only marginal dependence on
uncertainties in the IMF, whereas, fitting to local luminosity densities
depends strongly on both cosmic SFH and the IMF. We fit to these measurements
using population synthesis and find the best-fit IMF power-law slope to be
Gamma=1.15+-0.2 (0.5 < M/M_solar < 120). This slope is in good agreement with
the Salpeter IMF slope (Gamma=1.35). A strong upper limit of Gamma<1.7 is
obtained which effectively rules out the Scalo IMF due to its too low fraction
of high-mass stars. This upper limit is at the 99.7% confidence level if we
assume a closed-box chemical evolution scenario and 95% if we assume constant
solar metallicity. Fitting to the H-alpha line luminosity density, we obtain a
best-fit IMF slope in good agreement with that derived from broadband

gas shall have significant density at the tidal radius, and the gas may be lost
on timescales as short as a few times the sound crossing time of the system. In
colder systems, the density at the tidal radius is much lower, greatly reducing
the mass loss rate, and the system may retain its gas for a Hubble time. The
tidally removed gas shall follow an orbit close to that of the original host
system, forming an extended stream of ionized, gaseous debris. Tidal mass loss
severely limits the ability of dwarf systems to continuously form stars. The
ordinary gas content in many dwarf galaxies is fully ionized during high
red-shift epochs, possibly preventing star formation in some systems, leading
to the formation of starless, dark-matter concentrations. In either the field
or in the center of galaxy clusters, ionized gas may be retained by dwarf
galaxies, even though its sound speed may be comparable to or even exceed the

the field statistics, particularly the distribution of wave field amplitudes,
which are predicted by theories for wave growth in inhomogeneous media. This
paper shows that the field statistics of the Vela pulsar (PSR B0833-45) are
well-defined and vary as a function of pulse phase, evolving from Gaussian
intensity statistics off-pulse to approximately power-law and then lognormal
distributions near the pulse peak to approximately power-law and eventually
Gaussian statistics off-pulse again. Detailed single-component fits confirm
that the variability corresponds to lognormal statistics near the peak of the
pulse profile and Gaussian intensity statistics off-pulse. The lognormal field
statistics observed are consistent with the prediction of stochastic growth
theory (SGT) for a purely linear system close to marginal stability. The
simplest interpretations are that the pulsar's variability is a direct
manifestation of an SGT state and the emission mechanism is linear (either
direct or indirect), with no evidence for nonlinear mechanisms like
modulational instability and wave collapse which produce power-law field
statistics. Stringent constraints are placed on nonlinear mechanisms: they must
produce lognormal statistics when suitably ensemble-averaged. Field statistics
are thus a powerful, potentially widely applicable tool for understanding
variability and constraining mechanisms and source characteristics of coherent

region and then lognormal statistics on-pulse, excluding giant micropulses.
These data are analyzed here in terms of two superposed wave populations, using
a new calculation for the amplitude statistics of two vectorially-combined
transverse fields. Detailed analyses show that the approximately power-law and
lognormal distributions observed are fitted well at essentially all on-pulse
phases by Gaussian-lognormal and double-lognormal combinations, respectively.
These good fits, plus the smooth but significant variations in fit parameters
across the source, provide strong evidence that the approximately power-law
statistics observed in the transition region are not intrinsic. Instead, the
data are consistent with normal pulsar emission having lognormal statistics at
all phases. This is consistent with generation in an inhomogeneous source
obeying stochastic growth theory (SGT) and with the emission mechanism being
purely linear (either direct or indirect). A nonlinear mechanism is viable only
if it produces lognormal statistics when suitably ensemble-averaged. Variations
in the SGT fit parameters with phase imply that the radiation is relatively
more variable near the pulse edges than near the center, as found in earlier
work. In contrast, Vela's giant micropulses come from a very restricted phase
range and have power-law statistics with indices ($6.7 \pm 0.6$) not
inconsistent with nonlinear wave collapse. These results imply that normal
pulses have a different source and generation mechanism than giant micropulses,
as suggested previously on other grounds.

derivatives are popular among astronomers because of their simplicity and the
clear predictions they make for the SEDs of T Tauri stars and Herbig Ae/Be
stars. Moreover, they can be computed quickly, which is a great advantage when
fitting observations using automated procedures. In this paper we wish to
assess the accuracy and reliability of 2-layer models, by comparing them to
detailed vertical structure models with accurate 1+1D radiative transfer. We
focus on the shape of the SED, and the predicted height and ""flaring index"" of
the disk. We first consider models where scattering is set to zero. We find
that 2-layer models overestimate significantly the near-infrared flux, and we
suggest a simple way of correcting this effect, at least in part. At longer
wavelengths, the SED of two-layer models often show a two-bump structure, which
is absent in 1+1D models. Nevertheless, overall agreement is reasonably good,
and the differences are in most cases within 30%. At (sub)-mm wavelengths the
differences may even be less. The shape of the disk, as measured by its
pressure and surface scale height and by the flaring angle are also well
reproduced by two-layer models. When scattering is included in the 1+1D models,
the differences become larger, especially in the near-infrared. We suggest
simple ways to include scattering in two-layer models and discuss their
reliability. We do not compare the two-layer models to full 2-D/3-D models, so
the conclusions remain valid only within the annulus-by-annulus approximation.

significant stiffening of the high-energy magnon modes. We also explicitly
study the stability/instability of the mean-field ferromagnetic state, which
highlights the role of competing AF interactions causing spin twisting and
noncollinear ferromagnetic ordering.

the sublattice parameters misfit. A stretched matter (D - d_{0} = h > 0) can
exist in a unique intermediate state between the metal and the dielectric; this

of using resources as distributed data stores provide a convenient environment
for communities of researchers to share, replicate, and manage access to copies
of large datasets. This has led to the question of which replica can be
accessed most efficiently. In such environments, fetching data from one of the
several replica locations requires accurate predictions of end-to-end transfer
times. The answer to this question can depend on many factors, including
physical characteristics of the resources and the load behavior on the CPUs,
networks, and storage devices that are part of the end-to-end data path linking
possible sources and sinks. Our approach combines end-to-end application
throughput observations with network and disk load variations and captures
whole-system performance and variations in load patterns. Our predictions
characterize the effect of load variations of several shared devices (network
and disk) on file transfer times. We develop a suite of univariate and
multivariate predictors that can use multiple data sources to improve the
accuracy of the predictions as well as address Data Grid variations
(availability of data and sporadic nature of transfers). We ran a large set of

within 15% error for our testbed sites, which is quite promising for a

indicates that the fields generated by both an electric and a magnetic dipole

source propagate superluminally in the nearfield of the source and reduce to
the speed of light as the waves propagate into the farfield. Both the phase
speed and the group speed are shown to be superluminal in the nearfield of
these systems. Although the information speed is shown to differ from group
speed in the nearfield of these systems, provided the noise of the signal is
small and the modulation method is known, the information can be extracted in a
time period much smaller than the wave propagation time, thereby making the
information speed only slightly less than the superluminal group speed. It is
shown that relativity theory indicates that these superluminal signals can be
reflected off of a moving frame causing the information to arrive before the
signal was transmitted (i.e. backward in time). It is unknown if these signals

properly choosing the two arbitrary functions contained in the model, we obtain
a simple exact solution in which the evolution of the universe is divided into
several stages. Before the big bounce, the universe contracts from a $\Lambda
$-dominated vacuum, and after the bounce, the universe expands. In the early
time after the bounce, the expansion of the universe is decelerating. In the
late time after the bounce, dark energy (i.e., the variable cosmological
``constant'') overtakes dark matter and baryons, and the expansion enters an
accelerating stage. When time tends to infinity, the contribution of dark
energy tends to two third of the total energy density of the universe,
qualitatively in agreement with observations.

Dyson--Schwinger equations. We employ ansaetze for the dressed vertices such
that the running coupling and the quark mass function are independent of the
renormalisation point. Our solutions are in good agreement with the results of
recent lattice calculations.
  We find a weakly vanishing gluon propagator at small momenta and an infrared
singular ghost propagator in agreement with Zwanziger's horizon condition and
the Kugo-Ojima confinement criterion. The running coupling possesses an
infrared fixed point at alpha(0) = 8.92/N_c. To investigate the influence of
boundary conditions on the propagators we solved the ghost and gluon DSEs also
on a four-torus. Our results show typical finite volume effects but are still
close to the continuum solutions for sufficiently large volumes.
  For the quark propagator we find dynamically generated quark masses that
agree well with phenomenological values. The effects of unquenching the system
are found to be small. In particular the infrared behaviour of the ghost and
gluon dressing functions found in pure Yang-Mills theory is almost unchanged as
long as the number of light flavors is smaller than four.

the meaning of D-branes in imaginary time? The answer we propose is that
D-branes in imaginary time define purely closed string backgrounds. In
particular we prove that the disk scattering amplitude of m closed strings off
an arbitrary configuration of imaginary branes is equivalent to a sphere
amplitude with m+1 closed string insertions. The extra puncture is a specific
closed string state, generically normalizable, that depends on the details of
the brane configuration. We study in some detail the special case of the array
of imaginary D-branes related to Sen's BCFT and comment on its space-time
interpretation. We point out that a certain limit of our set-up allows to study
classical black hole creation and suggests a relation between Choptuik's

\epsilon_{m,n}N(m,n)$ where $\epsilon_{m,n} = 1$ unless $m\equiv$ 2(mod 4) and
$n$ is odd, in which case $\epsilon_{m,n} = -1$. Furthermore, Propp's method is
applicable to higher-dimensional cases. This paper discusses similar
investigations of the numbers $M(m,n)$, of monomer-dimer coverings, or
equivalently (not necessarily perfect) matchings of an $m$ by $n$ rectangular
grid. We show that for each fixed $m$ there is a unique way of extending
$M(m,n)$ to $n < 0$ so that the resulting bi-infinite sequence, $M(m,n)$ for $n
\in {Z}$, satisfies a linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients. We
show that $M(m,n)$, a priori a rational number, is always an integer, using a
generalization of the combinatorial model offered by Propp. Lastly, we give a
new statement of reciprocity in terms of multivariate generating functions from
which Stanley's result follows.

The random surface is represented by real-valued random variables \phi_i, where
i is in \Z^d. A class of natural generalizations of the standard random walk
are gradient models whose laws are (formally) expressed as
  P(d\phi) = 1/Z \exp[-\sum_{|i-j|=1}V(\phi_i-\phi_j)] \prod_i d\phi_i,
  V:\R -> R^+ convex, and with some growth conditions. Such surfaces have been
  introduced in theoretical physics as (simplified) models for random
interfaces separating different phases. Of particular interest are
localization-delocalization phenomena, for instance for a surface interacting
with a wall by attracting or repulsive interactions, or both together. Another
example are so-called heteropolymers which have a noise-induced interaction.

including the formation of water droplets from humid air (fog, rain), the
separation of a crystalline structure from an isotropic material such as a
liquid or even the formation of the sizzling gas bubbles when a soda can is
opened. It was recognized long ago (at least on a phenomenological level) that
systems exhibiting several phases in equilibrium can be described with an
appropriate variational principle: the phases arrange themselves in such a way
that the energy associated with the phase boundaries is minimal. Typically this
leads to an almost deterministic behavior and the phase boundaries are fairly
regular. However, when looked at from a microscopic point of view, the system
consists of a bunch of erratically moving molecules with relatively strong
short-range interaction and the simplicity of the above macroscopic description
looks more than miraculous. Indeed, when starting from the molecular level,
there are many more questions to be asked and understood: which are the phases
which we will see? why do only those occur? why are the phase boundaries sharp?
how should we find (define) the energy associated with the interfaces? Only
then can we ask the question: why does the system minimize this energy? It is
only in the last decade that a mathematically satisfactory understanding of
this phenomenon has been achieved. The main goal of the talk is to present the
current state of affairs focusing thereby on results obtained in joint works

density of a chaotic finite-duration discrete-time sequence the Welch average

to any stationary signal by using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
representation of a discrete-time series which allows an effective computation

[2.8,4] for producing the discrete-time series set. When the condition $r \geq
3.57$ is satisfied, each discrete-time series exhibited a positive value for
IAMSCI estimate, indicating a high level of coherence loss of the signal and
corresponding to a chaotic behavior of the dynamical system. Its effectiveness
was demonstrated by comparing the results with those obtained by calculating
the largest Lyapounov exponent of the time series set obtained from the

simple physical picture, we calculate ICEO flows around conducting cylinders in
steady (DC), oscillatory (AC), and suddenly-applied electric fields. This
picture, and these systems, represent perhaps the clearest example of nonlinear
electrokinetic phenomena. We complement and verify this physically-motivated
approach using a matched asymptotic expansion to the electrokinetic equations
in the thin double-layer and low potential limits. ICEO slip velocities vary
like $u_s \propto E_0^2 L$, where $E_0$ is the field strength and $L$ is a
geometric length scale, and are set up on a time scale $\tau_c = \lambda_D
L/D$, where $\lambda_D$ is the screening length and $D$ is the ionic diffusion
constant. We propose and analyze ICEO microfluidic pumps and mixers that
operate without moving parts under low applied potentials. Similar flows around
metallic colloids with fixed total charge have been described in the Russian
literature (largely unnoticed in the West). ICEO flows around conductors with
fixed potential, on the other hand, have no colloidal analog and offer further
possibilities for microfluidic applications.

introduce here a simple shell model for homogeneous viscoelastic flows that

on the large scales. Understanding the mechanism allows us to predict how the
amount of drag reduction depends of the various parameters in the model. The
main conclusion is that drag reduction is not a universal phenomenon, it peaks
in a window of parameters like Reynolds number and the relaxation rate of the
polymer.

teleportation (CVQT) with a conventional laser to analyze the CVQT experiment

questioned on the ground of intrinsic phase indeterminacy of the laser field

CVQT with a laser is valid only if the unknown phase of the laser field is
shared among sender's LOs, the EPR state, and receiver's LO. The CVQT
experiment is considered valid with the aid of an optical path other than the
EPR channel and a classical channel, directly linking between a sender and a
receiver. We also propose a method to probabilistically generate a strongly
phase-correlated quantum state via continuous measurement of independent

This paper presents a design of composite qubits to overcome both challenges.
Each qubit is encoded in the degenerate ground-state of four (or six) electrons
in a system of five quantum dots arranged in a two-dimensional pattern. This
decoherence-free subspace is immune to both collective and local decoherence,
and resists other forms of decoherence, which must raise the energy. The gate
operations for universal computation are simple and physically intuitive, and
are controlled by modifying the tunneling barriers between the dots--Control of
local magnetic fields is not required. A controlled-phase gate can be
implemented in a single pulse.

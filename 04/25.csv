many clusters of galaxies is shorter than the age of the cluster, but neither
the expected large drop in central temperature --nor the expected mass flow
towards the pressure-depleted cluster centers-- are observed. We propose a
solution to these ``cooling flow'' problems wherein energy is supplied to the
plasma by hadronic cosmic rays (CRs). The solution requires an energy
deposition more intense and more distributed than in conventional CR models,
but this alternative model is also successful in describing the origin of CRs,
as well as the properties of gamma ray bursts and of the diffuse gamma
background radiation. The X-ray energy emitted by clusters is supplied, in a
quasi-steady state, by the hadronic CRs, which act as ``warming rays''. The
temperature distribution in the intracluster space is successfully predicted
from the measured plasma-density distribution. Four other puzzling features of
clusters can also be explained in simple terms: the discrepancy between their
``virial'' and ``lensing'' masses, their large magnetic fields, the correlation
between their optical and X-ray luminosities, and the non-thermal tail of their
X-ray spectrum.

do not find any evidence for an increase in the LMXB formation rate in the

scenarios of dynamical LMXB formation in GCs. The old, metal-rich, red
population of GCs in NGC 3115 on the other hand is {\it at least} three times
as efficient at creating LMXBs as the old, metal-poor, blue clusters. These
data suggest that the higher formation efficiency of LMXBs in the red GC
subsystems of many galaxies is largely a consequence of their higher
metallicity. A comparison of the densities of field LMXBs in different galaxies
does not reveal an obvious correlation with the age of the field stars as
predicted by models in which the LMXB formation rate in the field drops
monotonically with time after an initial burst. This suggests that either a
significant fraction of the field LMXBs are created in GCs and subsequently
injected into the field, or the LMXB formation rate has a more complex time
evolution pattern.

uncertainties in the local velocity distribution on the interpretation of the
DAMA annual modulation signal (and the possibility that the form of the

study the dependence of the annual modulation on various astrophysical inputs.
We first examine the approximations used for the Earth's motion about the Sun

overly simplistic assumptions lead to errors of up to ten days in the phase and
up to tens of per-cent in the shape of the signal, even if the velocity

perpendicular to the motion of the Sun are neglected, then the change in the

examine how the annual modulation signal varies for physically and
observationally well-motivated velocity distributions. We find that the phase

cluster of galaxies, motivating us to explore the origin of intracluster
entropy and to describe how it develops in terms of some simple models. We
present an analytical model for smooth accretion, including both preheating and
radiative cooling, that links a cluster's entropy distribution to its mass
accretion history and shows that smooth accretion overproduces the entropy
observed in massive clusters by a factor ~2-3, depending on the mass accretion
rate. Any inhomogeneity in the accreting gas reduces entropy production at the
accretion shock; thus, smoothing of the gas accreting onto a cluster raises its
entropy level. Because smooth accretion produces more entropy than hierarchical
accretion, we suggest that some of the observed differences between clusters
and groups may arise because preheating smooths the smaller-scale lumps of gas
accreting onto groups more effectively than it smooths the larger-scale lumps
accreting onto clusters. This effect may explain why entropy levels at the
outskirts of groups are ~2-3 times larger than expected from self-similar
scaling arguments. The details of how the density distribution of accreting gas
affects the entropy distribution of a cluster are complex, and we suggest how
to explore the relevant physics with numerical simulations.

distribution in the universe. Building on earlier studies, we recall how the
statistics of the convergence field are related to the statistics of the
underlying mass distribution, in particular to the many-body density
correlations. We describe two model-independent approximations which provide
two simple methods to compute the probability distribution function, pdf, of
the convergence. We apply one of these to the case where the density field can
be described by a log-normal pdf. Next, we discuss two hierarchical models for
the high-order correlations which allow one to perform exact calculations and
evaluate the previous approximations in such specific cases. Finally, we apply
these methods to a very simple model for the evolution of the density field
from linear to highly non-linear scales. Comparisons with the results obtained
from numerical simulations, obtained from a number of different realizations,
show excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions. We have probed
various angular scales in the numerical work and considered sources at 14
different redshifts in each of two different cosmological scenarios, an open
cosmology and a flat cosmology with non-zero cosmological constant. Our
simulation technique employs computations of the full 3-d shear matrices along
the line of sight from the source redshift to the observer and is complementary
to more popular ray-tracing algorithms. Our results therefore provide a
valuable cross-check for such complementary simulation techniques, as well as
for our simple analytical model, from the linear to the highly non-linear
regime.

valid for starburst, normal and for quiescent galaxies. A minimal SFR per unit

and Jacobi coordinates should be used in any analyses of hierarchical planetary
systems. An approximate theory that can be applied to coplanar hierarchical
two-planet systems with a wide range of masses m_j and orbital eccentricities
e_j is the octupole-level secular perturbation theory (OSPT). The OSPT shows
that if the ratio of the maximum orbital angular momenta, lambda \approx
(m_1/m_2) alpha^{1/2}, for given a_j is approximately equal to a critical value
lambda_{crit}, then libration of the difference in the longitudes of periapse,
w_1-w_2, about either 0 or 180 deg. is almost certain, with possibly large
amplitude variations of both e_j. We establish that the OSPT is highly accurate
for systems with alpha<0.1 and reasonably accurate even for systems with alpha
as large as 1/3, provided that alpha is not too close to a significant
mean-motion commensurability or above the stability boundary. The HD 168443

about 180 deg. The libration of w_1-w_2 and the large-amplitude variations of
both e_j in the HD 12661 system are consistent with the analytic results on
systems with lambda \approx lambda_{crit}. The HD 12661 system with the best-

Perola, Stella (1993) using the Schwarzschild black hole metric to analyze such
effect. They assumed that the effect is applicable to a Kerr metric far beyond

(V-K) =2.57+/-0.06 (blue) and (V-K)=3.18+/-0.06 (red). The situation in NGC
7192 is different, in that the colour-colour diagram gives no evidence for a
distinct second population of globular clusters. Using simulated colour
distributions of globular cluster systems, we make a first step in quantifying
the cumulative age distribution in globular cluster systems. Also here the
result for NGC 5846 leads us to the conclusion that its metal-rich globular
cluster population contains two globular cluster populations which differ in
age by several Gyr. The age structure for NGC 7192 shows instead strong
similarity with a single-age population.

hydrodynamic simulations with atomic and molecular cooling and chemistry. In
this work, highly collimated and sheared jets are assumed. We find that
position-velocity diagrams, velocity-channel maps and the relative H$_2$ and CO

particular, the velocity width of the CO lines may prove most reliable although
the often-quoted mass-velocity power-law index is probably not. We demonstrate
how the relative H$_2$ 1--0 S(1) and CO J=1--0 fluxes evolve and apply this to

magnetic fields deep within the solar radiative zone. We find that reasonable
magnetic fields can significantly alter the shapes of the wave profiles for
helioseismic g-modes. They can do so because the existence of density gradients
allows g-modes to resonantly excite Alfven waves, causing mode energy to be
funnelled along magnetic field lines, away from the solar equatorial plane. The
resulting wave forms show comparatively sharp spikes in the density profile at
radii where these resonances take place. We estimate how big these waves might
be in the Sun, and perform a first search for observable consequences. We find
the density excursions at the resonances to be too narrow to be ruled out by
present-day analyses of p-wave helioseismic spectra, even if their amplitudes
were to be larger than a few percent. (In contrast it has been shown in
(Burgess et al. 2002) that such density excursions could affect solar neutrino
fluxes in an important way.) Because solar p-waves are not strongly influenced
by radiative-zone magnetic fields, standard analyses of helioseismic data
should not be significantly altered. The influence of the magnetic field on the
g-mode frequency spectrum could be used to probe sufficiently large
radiative-zone magnetic fields should solar g-modes ever be definitively
observed. Our results would have stronger implications if overstable solar
g-modes should prove to have very large amplitudes, as has sometimes been
argued.

The aim of the MACHO Project was the identification and quantitative
description of dark and luminous matter in the Milky Way using microlensing
toward the Magellanic Clouds and Galactic bulge. We start with a discussion of
the HST follow-up observations of the microlensing events toward the LMC
detected in the first 5 years of the experiment. Using color-magnitude diagrams
we attempt to distinguish between two possible locations of the microlensing
sources: 1) in the LMC or 2) behind the LMC. We conclude that unless the
extinction is extremely patchy, it is very unlikely that most of the LMC events
have sources behind the LMC. During an examination of the HST images of the 13
LMC events we found a very red object next to the source star of event LMC-5.
Astrometry, microlensing parallax fit, and a spectrum suggest that in this case
we directly image the lens - a low-mass disk star.
  Then we focus on the majority of events observed by the MACHO Project, which
are detected toward the Galactic bulge. We argue that the microlensing optical
depth toward the bulge is best measured using events that have clump giant
sources, which are almost unaffected by blending. From this sample we derive a
low optical depth toward the Galactic bulge of (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10^{-6}, in good
agreement with other observational constraints and with theoretical models. The
presence of many long-duration events among the bulge candidates allows us to
investigate the microlensing parallax effect. Events with the strongest
parallax signal are probably due to massive remnants. Events MACHO-96-BLG-5 and
MACHO-98-BLG-6 might have been caused by the 6-solar-mass black holes.

or turbulent. To describe the latter, vortices in turbulent flow are modelled
with stable vortex filaments. While this is an idealization in classical
fluids, vortices are real topologically stable quantized objects in
superfluids. Thus superfluid turbulence is thought to hold the key to new
understanding on turbulence in general. The fermion superfluid 3He offers
further possibilities owing to a large variation in its hydrodynamic
characteristics over the experimentally accessible temperatures. While studying
the hydrodynamics of the B phase of superfluid 3He, we discovered a sharp
transition at 0.60Tc between two regimes, with regular behaviour at
high-temperatures and turbulence at low-temperatures. Unlike in classical
fluids, this transition is insensitive to velocity and occurs at a temperature
where the dissipative vortex damping drops below a critical limit. This
discovery resolves the conflict between existing high- and low-temperature
measurements in 3He-B: At high temperatures in rotating flow a vortex loop
injected into superflow has been observed to expand monotonically to a single
rectilinear vortex line, while at very low temperatures a tangled network of
quantized vortex lines can be generated in a quiescent bath with a vibrating
wire. The solution of this conflict reveals a new intrinsic criterion for the
existence of superfluid turbulence.

This has help us to clarify and extend several aspects of their dynamics. We
have found that the decay of winding states into non-winding states behaving
like a gas of ordinary non-relativistic particles precludes the existence of a
late expansion phase of the universe and obstructs the growth of three large
spatial dimensions as we observe today. We propose a generic solution to this
problem by considering the dynamics of a gas of non-static branes. We have also
obtained a simple criterion on the initial conditions to ensure the small
string coupling approximation along the whole dynamical evolution, and
consequently, the consistency of an effective low-energy description. Finally,
we have reexamined the general conditions for a loitering period in the
evolution of the universe which could serve as a mechanism to resolve the {\sl

standard cosmology - and discussed the scaling properties of a self-interacting

of types of plane curves as the number of self-intersections goes to infinity.
In view of the description of prime alternating links as flype equivalence
classes of plane curves, a similar conjecture is made for the asymptotic number
of prime alternating knots. The rationale leading to these conjectures is given
by quantum field theory. Plane curves are viewed as configurations of loops on
a random planar lattices, that are in turn interpreted as a model of 2d quantum
gravity with matter. The identification of the universality class of this model
yields the conjecture. Since approximate counting or sampling planar curves
with more than a few dozens of intersections is an open problem, direct
confrontation with numerical data yields no convincing indication on the
correctness of our conjectures. However, our physical approach yields a more
general conjecture about connected systems of curves. We take advantage of this

samplers for large planar maps. The numerical datas strongly support our

Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation has been extended to various classes
of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. They include linear
divergence and nondivergence equations with discontinuous coefficients,
equations with degenerate quadratic form, quasilinear and fully nonlinear
equations, as well as equations on Riemannian manifolds, graphs, groups, and
metric spaces. A common feature of these equations is that all of them are of
second order, and Wiener type characterizations for higher order equations have
been unknown so far. Indeed, the increase of the order results in the loss of
the maximum principle, Harnack's inequality, barrier techniques, and level
truncation arguments, which are ingredients in different proofs related to the
Wiener test for the second order equations.
  In the present work we extend Wiener's result to elliptic differential
operators $L(\partial)$ of order $2m$ in the Euclidean space ${\bf R}^n$ with
constant real coefficients
  $$L(\partial)=(-1)^m\sum_{|\alpha|=|\beta|=m}a_{\alpha\beta}
\partial^{\alpha+ \beta}.$$
  The results can be extended to equations with variable (for example, H\""older
continuous) coefficients in divergence form but we leave aside this
generalization to make exposition more lucid.

functionals on random search trees that satisfy recurrence relations of a
simple additive form. Many important functionals including the space
requirement, internal path length, and the so-called shape functional fall
under this framework. Our goal is to derive asymptotics of moments and identify
limiting distributions of these functionals under two commonly studied
probability models -- the random permutation model and the uniform model.
  For the random permutation model, our approach is based on establishing
transfer theorems that link the order of growth of the input into a particular
deterministic recurrence to the order of growth of the output. For the uniform
model, our approach is based on the complex-analytic tool of singularity
analysis. To facilitate a systematic analysis of these additive functionals we
extend singularity analysis, a class of methods by which one can translate on a
term-by-term basis an asymptotic expansion of a functional around its dominant
singularity into a corresponding expansion for the Taylor coefficients of the
function. The most important extension is the determination of how
singularities are composed under the operation of Hadamard product of analytic
power series.
  The transfer theorems derived are used in conjunction with the method of
moments to establish limit laws for m-ary search trees under the random
permutation model. For the uniform model on binary search trees, the extended
singularity analysis toolkit is employed to establish the asymptotic behavior
of the moments of a wide class of functionals. These asymptotics are used,
again in conjunction with the method of moments, to derive limit laws.

oscillating rotation number function. The nonmonotonic property of the rotation
number function induced by the triplication of the elliptic fixed point is
superposed on the nonmonotonic character due to the oscillating perturbation.
This superposition leads to the co-manifestation of generic phenomena such as
reconnection and meandering, with the nongeneric scenario of creation of
vortices. The nonmonotonic property due to the triplication bifurcation is
shown to be different from that exhibited by the cubic Henon map, which can be
considered as the prototype of area preserving maps which undergo a
triplication followed by the twistless bifurcation. Our study exploits the
reversibility property of the initial system, which induces the time-reversal

Moreover, Alice and Bob are only inanimate objects. They know nothing. What is
teleported instantaneously from one system (Alice) to another system (Bob) is
the applicability of the preparer's knowledge to the state of a particular
qubit in these systems. The operation necessitates dual classical and quantum
channels. Other examples of dual transmission, including ``unspeakable

consequences can be explored in general settings encompassing quantum
mechanics, classical theory, and more. Quantum states are compendia of
probabilities for the outcomes of possible operations we may perform a system:
``operational states.'' I discuss general frameworks for ``operational
theories'' (sets of possible operational states of a system), in which
convexity plays key role. The main technical content of the paper is in a
theorem that any such theory naturally gives rise to a ``weak effect algebra''
when outcomes having the same probability in all states are identified, and in
the introduction of a notion of ``operation algebra'' that also takes account
of sequential and conditional operations. Such frameworks are appropriate for
investigating what things look like from an ``inside view,'' i.e. for
describing perspectival information that one subsystem of the world can have
about another. Understanding how such views can combine, and whether an overall
``geometric'' picture (``outside view'') coordinating them all can be had, even
if this picture is very different in structure from the perspectives within it,
is the key to whether we may be able to achieve a unified, ``objective''
physical view in which quantum mechanics is the appropriate description for
certain perspectives, or whether quantum mechanics is truly telling us we must
go beyond this ``geometric'' conception of physics.

of quantum interactions associated with the quantum error correction process
small: a constant number per quantum bit, independent of the blocklength.
Third, sparse graph codes often offer great flexibility with respect to
blocklength and rate. We believe some of the codes we present are unsurpassed
by previously published quantum error-correcting codes.

the spin of a sample of laser cooled atoms trapped in an optical lattice. One
of the optical lattice beams serves also as a probe beam, thereby allowing one
to monitor the atomic dynamics in real time and with minimal perturbation. A
simple theory is developed to predict the measurement sensitivity and
associated cost in terms of decoherence caused by the scattering of probe
photons. Calculated signal-to-noise ratios in measurements of Larmor precession
are found to agree with experimental data for a wide range of lattice intensity
and detuning. Finally, quantum backaction is estimated by comparing the
measurement sensitivity to spin projection noise, and shown to be insignificant
in the current experiment. A continuous quantum measurement based on Faraday
spectroscopy in optical lattices may open up new possibilities for the study of
quantum feedback and classically chaotic quantum systems.

atom-mode interaction can be utilized to modify the quantum field in a cavity.
When an atom shoots through the cavity field, it is expected to experience a
trigonometric time dependence of its coupling constant. We investigate the
possibilities this offers to modify the field. As a point of comparison we use
the solvable Rosen-Zener model, which has parameter dependencies roughly
similar to the ones expected in a real cavity. We do confirm that by repeatedly
sending atoms through the cavity, we can obtain filters on the photon states.
Highly non-classical states can be obtained. We find that the Rosen-Zener model
is more sensitive to the detuning than the case of a trigonometric coupling.

construction generalises a construction for nonlinear Schr\""odinger equations.
To relate N^2 with physically motivated principles we assume: locality (i.e. it
contains no explicit derivative and no derivatives of the wave function),
separability (i.e. it acts on product states componentwise) and Poincar\'e
invariance. Furthermore we want that a positional density is invariant under
N^2. Such nonlinear transformations yield NLDE which describe physically
equivalent systems. To get 'new' systems, we extend this NLDE (gauge extension)
and present a family of NLDE which is a slight nonlinear generalisation of the
Dirac equation. We discuss and comment the fact that nonlinear evolutions are
not consistent with the usual framework of quantum theory. To develop a
corresponding extended framework one needs models for nonlinear evolutions
which also indicate possible physical consequences of nonlinearities.

a number of starburst regions in a circumnuclear spiral, as well as in the
nucleus itself. A high spatial resolution Chandra image of this source reveals
that the soft X-ray emission traces the ultraviolet nuclear spiral down to a
core, which is unresolved both in soft and hard X-rays. The astrometry of the
X-ray core coincides with the UV core within the Chandra positioning accuracy.
The total X-ray luminosity of the core, 1.5*10^{39} erg/s, is similar to that
from some LINERs or from the weakest Seyferts detected so far. The soft X-rays
in both the core and the extended structure surrounding it can be well
reproduced by evolutionary synthesis models (which include the emission
expected from single stars, the hot diffuse gas, supernova remnants and binary
systems), consistent with the properties of the young stellar clusters
identified in the UV. The hard X-ray tail detected in the core spectrum,
however, most likely requires the presence of an additional source. This
additional source could either be a weak active nucleus black hole or an
ultraluminous X-ray object. The implications of these results are discussed.

variable objects. Various criteria were employed to select candidate variable
stars. Period searches were performed on the selected candidates using phase
dispersion minimization (PDM). The reliability of the PDM search results was
tested using synthetic light curves of eclipsing binary stars and sinusoidal
light curves of different periods. Results from this analysis showed that there
are probably no eclipsing binary stars or periodic variables in our field with
periods on the order of a few hours to a few days, down to limiting magnitudes
of V~25 and I~24, which is consistent with the absence of contact binaries such
as W Ursae Majoris systems. However, one candidate variable star does show an
increase in brightness of ~0.1 magnitudes in both bandpasses, which seems to
last for a few days. Possible explanations concerning the nature of this object
include a binary system with a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence
secondary, or a BY Draconis variable star. We are able to set an upper limit to

metal-poor galaxies make the appearance of their infrared (IR) spectral energy
distribution (SED) quite different from that of nearby, older galaxies. To
study this effect, we have developed a model for the evolution of dust content
and the IR SED of low-metallicity, extremely young galaxies based on Hirashita
et al. (2002). We find that, even in the intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation
field of very young galaxies, small silicate grains are subject to stochastic
heating resulting in a broad temperature distribution and substantial MIR
continuum emission. Larger carbonaceous grains are in thermal equilibrium at T
\simeq 50 - 100K, and they also contribute to the MIR. We present the evolution
of SEDs and IR extinction of very young, low-metallicity galaxies. The IR
extinction curve is also shown. In the first few Myrs, the emission peaks at
\lambda \sim 30-50um at later times dust self-absorption decreases the apparent
grain temperatures, shifting the bulk of the emission into the submillimetre
band. We successfully apply the model to the IR SED of a low metallicity (1/41
Z_\odot) dwarf galaxy SBS0335-052. We find the SED, optical properties and
extinction of the star forming region to be consistent with a very young and
compact starburst. We also predict the SED of another extremely low-metallicity
galaxy, I Zw 18, for future observational tests. Some prospects for future
observations are discussed.

propose a method for directly detecting MASCOs in extragalactic halos, using
the VLBI techniques with extremely high resolution. If a galactic halo
comprising a large number of MASCOs produces multiple images of a background
radio-loud QSO by gravitational lensing, then a high-resolution radio map of
each macro-lensed image should reveal microlensing effects by MASCOs. To assess
their observational feasibility, we simulate microlensing of the radio-loud,
four-image lensed QSO, B1422+231, assuming angular resolution of ~0.01 mas.
MASCOs are represented by point masses. For comparison, we also simulate
microlensing of B1422+231 by singular isothermal spheres. We find that the
surface brightness of the macro-lensed images shows distinct spatial patterns
on the scale of the Einstein radius of the perturbers. In the case of
point-mass perturbers, many tiny dark spots also appear in the macro-lensed
images associated with a decrease in the surface brightness toward the fringe
of the original QSO image, whereas no such spots are available in the SIS
models. Based on the size, position and magnified or demagnified patterns of
images, we shall be able to determine the mass and density profile of a MASCO
as well as its spatial distribution and abundance in a galactic halo.

stars with Stroemgren temperatures between 10,000 and 12,000 K we found
excellent agreement between the atmospheric parameters derived from Stroemgren
photometry and those derived from Balmer line profile fits. However, for cooler
stars there is a disagreement in the parameters derived by the two methods, for
which we have no satisfactory explanation. Stars hotter than 12,000 K show
evidence for helium depletion and iron enrichment, both in M 3 and M 13.
Accounting for the iron enrichment substantially improves the agreement with
canonical evolutionary models, although the derived gravities and masses are
still somewhat too low. This remaining discrepancy may be an indication that
scaled-solar metal-rich model atmospheres do not adequately represent the
highly non-solar abundance ratios found in blue HB stars affected by diffusion.
We discuss the effects of an enhancement in the envelope helium abundance on
the atmospheric parameters of the blue HB stars, as might be caused by deep
mixing on the red giant branch or primordial pollution from an earlier
generation of intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch stars.

a significant way by the presence of the precessing magnetic field. In

The difference between inflaton preheating and flaton preheating, is that the

thermal bath are important and cannot be neglected.
  Preheating of MSSM flat directions is typically delayed due to out-of-phase

perturbative decay or $Q$-ball formation. Particle production due to the
violation of adiabaticity is expected to be inefficient due to back reaction

$a_{i}a_{j}^{\dagger}-q_{ij}a_{j}^{\dagger}a_{i} = \delta_{ij}, i,j\in I$ with
$(q_{ij})_{i,j\in I}$ any hermitian matrix of deformation parameters. We obtain
an elegant formula for normally ordered (sometimes called Wick-ordered) series
expansions of number operators (which determine a free Hamiltonian). As a main
result (see Theorem 1) we prove that the number operators are given, with
respect to a basis formed by ""generalized Lie elements"", by certain normally
ordered quadratic expressions with coefficients given precisely by the entries
of the inverses of Gram matrices of multiparticle weight spaces. (This settles
a conjecture of two of the authors (S.M and A.P), stated in [8]). These Gram
matrices are hermitian generalizations of the Varchenko's matrices, associated
to a quantum (symmetric) bilinear form of diagonal arrangements of hyperplanes
(see [12]). The solution of the inversion problem of such matrices in [9]
(Theorem 2.2.17), leads to an effective formula for the number operators
studied in this paper. The one parameter case, in the monomial basis, was
studied by Zagier [15], Stanciu [11] and M{\o}ller [6].

d\ge1, where distinct sites x,y\in Z^d get connected with probability
p_{xy}\in[0,1]. Assuming p_{xy}=|x-y|^{-s+o(1)} as |x-y|\to\infty, where s>0
and |\cdot| is a norm distance on Z^d, and supposing that the resulting random
graph contains an infinite connected component C_{\infty}, we let D(x,y) be the
graph distance between x and y measured on C_{\infty}. Our main result is that,
for s\in(d,2d), D(x,y)=(\log|x-y|)^{\Delta+o(1)},\qquad x,y\in C_{\infty},
|x-y|\to\infty, where \Delta^{-1} is the binary logarithm of 2d/s and o(1) is a
quantity tending to zero in probability as |x-y|\to\infty. Besides its interest
for general percolation theory, this result sheds some light on a question that
has recently surfaced in the context of ``small-world'' phenomena. As part of
the proof we also establish tight bounds on the probability that the largest
connected component in a finite box contains a positive fraction of all sites
in the box.

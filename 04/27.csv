methanol toward three low-mass young stellar objects located in the Serpens and
Chameleon molecular cloud complexes. The sources were observed as part of a
large spectroscopic survey of ~40 protostars. This is the first detection of
solid methanol in the vicinity of low mass (M <1 Msol) young stars and shows
that the formation of methanol does not depend on the proximity of massive
young stars. The abundances of solid methanol compared to water ice for the
three sources are in the range 15-25% which is comparable to those for the most
methanol-rich massive sources known. The presence of abundant methanol in the
circumstellar environment of some low mass young stars has important
consequences for the formation scenarios of methanol and more complex organic
species near young solar-type stars.

emission spectra from PBHs in the Standard Model and mSUGRA benchmark models
were investigated numerically. The point source and diffuse gamma-ray spectra
from PBHs were also found numerically. It was found that the instantaneous
photon flux from PBHs in mSUGRA benchmark models is generally less than
approximately four times greater than in the Standard Model. The point source
flux from a PBH in its final stages of emission will in mSUGRA benchmark models
both quantitatively and qualitatively differ from that in the Standard Model.
The dominant part of the diffuse gamma-ray flux should not be affected by any
supersymmetric particles. However, for PBHs with initial mass approximately in
the range [4x10^13 g, 1x10^14 g], the diffuse Standard Model flux at photon
energies E_0 > ~1 GeV will generally be less than roughly 50% greater than for
mSUGRA benchmark models. The results generally show good agreement with
previous works, although model differences give some disagreement. It is
concluded that it is unlikely that the effects found could be detected with the
upcoming gamma-ray satellite GLAST, due for launch in 2006. This Master's
Thesis also gives a review of PBH formation and emission, as well as some
cosmological consequences associated with PBHs. The concept of supersymmetry in
quantum mechanics and particle physics is also introduced.

apply this method to a sample of 4500 Ly-$\alpha$ absorbers and recover the
cold dark matter (CDM) like power spectrum at scales $\geq 300h^{-1}$kpc with a
precision of $\sim$ 10%. However at scales $\sim 10 - 300 h^{-1}$kpc the
measured and CDM--like spectra are noticeable different. This result suggests a
complex inflation with generation of excess power at small scales. The
magnitude and reliability of these deviations depend also upon the possible
incompleteness of our sample and poorly understood process of formation of weak
absorbers. Confirmation of the CDM--like shape of the initial power spectrum or
detection of its distortions at small scales are equally important for widely
discussed problems of physics of the early Universe, galaxy formation, and
reheating of the Universe. Our method links the observed mass function of
absorbers with the correlation function of the initial velocity field and
therefore it avoids the Nyquist restrictions limiting the investigations based
on the smoothed flux or density fields.
  The physical model of absorbers adopted here asserts that they are formed in
the course of both linear and nonlinear adiabatic or shock compression of dark
matter (DM) and gaseous matter. At scales $\geq 1h^{-1}$Mpc all characteristics
of the DM component and, in particular, their redshift distribution are found
to be consistent with theoretical expectations for Gaussian initial

collaboration network, scientists have a finite time span of being active; in
movie actors network, once popular stars are retiring from stage; devices on
the Internet may become outmoded with techniques developing so rapidly. Here we
find in citation networks that this effect can be represented by an exponential
decay factor, $e^{-\beta \tau}$, where $\tau $ is the node age, while other
evolving networks (the Internet for instance) may have different types of
aging, for example, a power-law decay factor, which is also studied and
compared. It has been found that as soon as such a factor is introduced to the
Barabasi-Albert Scale-Free model, the network will be significantly
transformed. The network will be clustered even with infinitely large size, and
the clustering coefficient varies greatly with the intensity of the aging
effect, i.e. it increases linearly with $\beta $ for small values of $\beta $
and decays exponentially for large values of $\beta $. At the same time, the
aging effect may also result in a hierarchical structure and a disassortative
degree-degree correlation. Generally the aging effect will increase the average
distance between nodes, but the result depends on the type of the decay factor.
The network appears like a one-dimensional chain when exponential decay is
chosen, but with power-law decay, a transformation process is observed, i.e.,
from a small-world network to a hypercubic lattice, and to a one-dimensional
chain finally. The disparities observed for different choices of the decay
factor, in clustering, average node distance and probably other aspects not yet
identified, are believed to bear significant meaning on empirical data
acquisition.

The advantage of this approach is that one does not need to make further
assumptions on the derivatives of model parameters with respect to the quark
current mass. The normally accepted model-independent result in nuclear matter
is naturally reproduced. The change of the quark condensate induced by
interactions depends on the incompressibility of nuclear matter. When it is
greater than 260 MeV, the density at which the condensate vanishes is higher
than that from the linear extrapolation. For the chiral condensate in quark
matter, a similar model-independent linear behavior is found at lower
densities, which means that the decreasing speed of the condensate in quark
matter is merely half of that in nuclear matter if the pion-nucleon sigma
commutator is six times the average current mass of u and d quarks. The
modification due to QCD-like interactions is found to slow the decreasing speed
of the condensate, compared with the linear extrapolation.

$n!\times n!$ matrices $A_{n}(\{q_{kl}\})$ of scalar products of n-particle

by explicit factorizations of $A_{n}(\{q_{kl}\})$ as a product of matrices of

Conjecture to multiparameter case. By applying a faster algorithm in
Prop.2.2.19 we obtain in Th.2.2.20 explicit formulas for the inverse of the
matrices $A_n(\{q_{kl}\})$ in the generic case. There are applications of these
results to discriminant arrangements of hyperplanes and to contravariant forms
of certain quantum groups.

possible definitions of these manifolds use certain parallel para-quaternionic

relate these different definitions we study para-quaternionic algebras in

a curvature tensor of the para-quaternionic type is also described.

  nearest neighbors",,,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.084102",,"nlin.CD",,"  A symbolic analysis of observed time series data requires making a discrete
partition of a continuous state space containing observations of the dynamics.
A particular kind of partition, called ``generating'', preserves all dynamical
information of a deterministic map in the symbolic representation, but such
partitions are not obvious beyond one dimension, and existing methods to find
them require significant knowledge of the dynamical evolution operator or the
spectrum of unstable periodic orbits. We introduce a statistic and algorithm to
refine empirical partitions for symbolic state reconstruction. This method
optimizes an essential property of a generating partition: avoiding topological
degeneracies. It requires only the observed time series and is sensible even in
the presence of noise when no truly generating partition is possible. Because
of its resemblance to a geometrical statistic frequently used for
reconstructing valid time-delay embeddings, we call the algorithm ``symbolic
false nearest neighbors''.

construction of these ""privileged"" exact bound states may be extended to much
higher q (meaning an enhanced flexibility of the shape of the force) at a cost
of narrowing the set of wavefunctions (with degree N restricted to the first

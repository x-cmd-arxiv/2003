immediately after mass-energy equality by plasma fragmentation at 30,000 years
when viscous and weak turbulence forces first balance gravitational forces
within the horizon L_H = ct < L_J = c/[3\rho G]^1/2, contrary to the Jeans 1902
criterion. Buoyancy forces fossilize the 10^-12 s^-1 rate-of-strain and the
10^-17 kg m^-3 baryonic density. The non-baryonic dark matter (NBDM) diffuses
into the voids rather than forming cold-dark-matter (CDM) halos required by
CDMHCC. From HGT, supercluster-mass to galaxy-mass fragments exist at the
plasma to gas transition, and these fragment further to form
proto-globular-star clusters (PGCs) and planetary-mass primordial-fog-particles
(PFPs): the baryonic dark matter of the interstellar-medium and
inner-galaxy-dark-matter-halos, from which all planets and stars are formed by
accretion (Gibson 1996, Schild 1996). From HGT and a rich cluster mass profile
(Tyson and Fischer 1995), D_NBDM = 6 x10^28 m^2 s^-1, m_NBDM <= 10^-33 kg, and
the NBDM forms outer-galaxy halos after 300,000 years.

stationary over time. However, as the surface magnetic field weakens, the
accretion takes place over a wider region around the pole, making the flow more
radial and isotropic. In the present work, we extend this two-dimensional model
to include the time-dependence of the flow of the accreted material. The final
radial flow is found to be less efficient in screening the magnetic field
compared to the initial tangential flow. After an initial phase of rapid decay,
the magnetic field slowly reaches an asymptotic value when the accretion
becomes nearly isotropic and radial. Assuming the initial extent of the polar
cap to be $\sim 5^0$--$10^0$, a simple geometric argument suggests that the
magnetic field should decay by 3-4 orders of magnitude before stabilizing to an
asymptotic value, consistent with the magnetic fields observed in millisecond
pulsars.

Individual giant pulses reach brightness temperatures of at least $10^{32}$K in
our data, which do not resolve the narrowest pulses, and are known to reach
$10^{37}$K in nanosecond-resolution observations (Hankins et al 2003). Giant
pulses are therefore the brightest known in the observable universe and
represent an important milestone for theories of the pulsar emission mechanism
to explain. Their short durations allow them to serve as especially sensitive
probes of the Crab Nebula and the interstellar medium. We analyze frequency
structure in individual giant pulses using a scintillating,
amplitude-modulated,polarized shot-noise model. The frequency structure
associated with multipath propagation decorrelates on a time scale of 25 sec at
1.5 GHz, which requires that multipath propagation be strongly influenced by
material within the Crab Nebula. Additional frequency structure decorrelates
faster than one spin period, as would be expected from the shot-noise pattern
of nanosecond duration pulses emitted by the pulsar. Taking into account the
Crab pulsar's locality inside a bright supernova remnant, we conclude that the
brightest pulse in a typical 1-hour observation would be most easily detectable
in our lowest frequency band (0.43 GHz) to a distance of 1.6 Mpc. We also
discuss the detection of such pulses using future instruments such as LOFAR and

capable to initiate the formation of rising flux loops at preferred longitudes

that, despite their small magnitude, tidal effects can lead to a considerable
longitudinal asymmetry in the formation probability of flux loops, since the
breaking of the axial symmetry due to the presence of the companion star is
reinforced by the sensitive dependence of the stability properties on the
stellar stratification and by resonance effects. The orientation of preferred
longitudes of loop formation depends on the equilibrium configuration and the
wave number of the dominating eigenmode. The change of the growth times of
unstable modes with respect to the case of a single star is very small.

the tidal effects are able to generate non-uniformities in the surface
distribution of erupting flux tubes. Assuming a synchronised system with a
rotation period of two days and consisting of two solar-type components, both
the tidal force and the deviation of the stellar structure from spherical shape
are considered in lowest-order perturbation theory. The magnetic field is
initially stored in the form of toroidal magnetic flux rings within the stably
stratified overshoot region beneath the convection zone. Once the field has
grown sufficiently strong, instabilities initiate the formation of rising flux
loops, which rise through the convection zone and emerge at the stellar
surface. We find that although the magnitude of tidal effects is rather small,
they nevertheless lead to the formation of clusters of flux tube eruptions at
preferred longitudes on opposite sides of the star, which result from the
cumulative and resonant character of the action of tidal effects on rising flux
tubes. The longitude distribution of the clusters depends on the initial
parameters of flux tubes in the overshoot region like magnetic field strength
and latitude, implying that there is no globally unique preferred longitude

nine most frequent type-I X-ray bursters in the Galactic center region. Six
years of observations (from 1996 to 2002) have amounted to 7 Ms of Galactic
center observations and the detection of 1823 bursts. The 3 most frequent
bursters are GX 354-0 (423 bursts), KS 1731-260 (339) and GS 1826-24 (260).
These numbers reflect an unique dataset. We show that all sources have the same
global burst behavior as a function of luminosity. At the lowest luminosities
(L_X<=2E37 erg/s bursts occur quasi-periodically and the burst rate increases
linearly with accretion rate (clear in e.g. GS 1826-24 and KS 1731-260). At
L_pers=2E37 erg/s the burst rate drops by a factor of five. This corresponds to
the transition from, on average, a hydrogen-rich to a pure helium environment
in which the flashes originate that are responsible for the bursts. At higher
luminosities the bursts recur irregularly; no bursts are observed at the
highest luminosities. Our central finding is that most of the trends in
bursting behavior are driven by the onset of stable hydrogen burning in the
neutron star atmosphere. Furthermore, we notice three new observational fact
which are difficult to explain with current burst theory: the presence of short
pure-helium bursts at the lowest accretion regimes, the bimodal distribution of
peak burst rates, and an accretion rate that is ten times higher than predicted
at which the onset of stable hydrogen burning occurs. Finally, we note that our
investigation is the first to signal quasi-periodic burst recurrence in KS
1731-260, and a clear proportionality between the frequency of the
quasi-periodicity and the persistent flux in GS 1826-24 and KS 1731-260.

  We apply our modelling technique to calculate the observed kinematics of
realistic models for dusty disc galaxies. We find that the effects of dust on
the mean projected velocity and projected velocity dispersion are severe for
edge-on galaxies. For galaxies which deviate more than a few degrees from
exactly edge-on, the effects are already strongly reduced. As a consequence,
dust attenuation cannot serve as a possible way to reconcile the discrepancy
between the observed shallow slopes of the inner rotation curves of LSB
galaxies and the predictions of CDM cosmological models. For face-on galaxies,
the velocity dispersion increases with increasing dust mass due to scattering,
but the effects are limited, even for extended dust distributions. Finally, we
show that serious errors can be made when the individual velocities of the dust
grains are neglected in the calculations.

observables such as the 2-point correlation function exhibit the same problem
already at 1-loop order. These difficulties are due to the non-analyticity of
the renormalized disorder correlator at zero temperature, which is inherent to
the physics beyond the Larkin length, characterized by many metastable states.
As a result, 2-loop diagrams, which involve derivatives of the disorder
correlator at the non-analytic point, are naively ""ambiguous''. We examine
several routes out of this dilemma, which lead to a unique renormalizable
field-theory at 2-loop order. It is also the only theory consistent with the
potentiality of the problem. The beta-function differs from previous work and
the one at depinning by novel ""anomalous terms''. For interfaces and random

evaluate the universal amplitude of the 2-point function. We also clarify the

All predictions are in good agreement with numerical and exact results, and an

typically migrates to the colder regions of the fluid as a result of thermal
diffusion (Soret effect). However, in recent thermodiffusion experiments on
poly(ethylene-oxide) (PEO) in a mixed ethanol/water solvent it is observed that
for some solvent compositions the polymer migrates to the cold side, while for
other compositions it migrates to the warm side. In order to understand this
behavior, we have developed a two-chamber lattice model approach to investigate
thermodiffusion in dilute polymer solutions. For a short polymer chain in an
incompressible, one-component solvent we obtain exact results for the
partitioning of the polymer between a warm and a cold chamber. In order to
describe mixtures of PEO, ethanol, and water, we have extended this simple
model to account for compressibility and hydrogen bonding between PEO and water
molecules. For this complex system, we obtain approximate results for the
composition in the warmer and cooler chambers that allow us to calculate Soret
coefficients for given temperature, pressure, and solvent composition. The sign
of the Soret coefficient is found to change from negative (polymer enriched in
warmer region) to positive (polymer enriched in cooler region) as the water
content of the solution is increased, in agreement with experimental data. We
also investigate the temperature dependence of the Soret effect and find that a
change in temperature can induce a change in the sign of the Soret coefficient.
We note a close relationship between the solvent quality and the partitioning
of the polymer between the two chambers, which may explain why negative Soret
coefficients for polymers are so rarely observed.

marked renormalization of the copper-oxygen overlap, making it smaller than the
oxygen-oxygen overlap, while the copper-oxygen energy splitting is the largest
of the three. The same regime was found previously in a zeroth-order fit of

resolves the only qualitative discrepancy of the zeroth-order mean-field

flat region of the dispersion around the vH point is due to the very
non-dispersive central peak in the X-M direction. The sudden increase of the
experimental one-particle dispersion in the X-M direction is explained by the
quasiparticle strength shifting to the upper wing of the magnetic pseudogap, as

use of dimensionally dependent tensor identities enables us to derive a number
of 4-dimensional identities by straightforward tensor methods in a signature
independent manner. In particular, we consider the quadratic identity for the
Bel-Robinson tensor ${\cal T}_{abcx}{\cal T}^{abcy} = \delta_x^y {\cal
T}_{abcd}{\cal T}^{abcd}/4$ and also the new conservation laws for the
Chevreton tensor, both of which have been obtained by spinor means; both of
these results are rederived by {\it tensor} means for 4-dimensional spaces of
any signature, using dimensionally dependent identities, and also we are able
to conclude that there are no {\it direct} higher dimensional analogues. In
addition we demonstrate a simple way to show non-existense of such identities
via counter examples; in particular we show that there is no non-trivial Bel
tensor analogue of this simple Bel-Robinson tensor quadratic identity. On the
other hand, as a sample of the power of generalising dimensionally dependent
tensor identities from four to higher dimensions, we show that the symmetry
structure, trace-free and divergence-free nature of the four dimensional
Bel-Robinson tensor does have an analogue for a class of tensors in higher
dimensions.

confirm that the resulting processed power spectrum is richer than for the more
familiar cases of cold, warm and hot dark matter. The new features include a
maximum at a certain scale $\lambda_{max}$, collisional damping below a smaller
characteristic scale $\lambda'_S$, with oscillatory perturbations between the
two. These scales are functions of the fundamental parameters of the theory. In
particular, they decrease for decreasing $x$, the ratio of the mirror plasma
temperature to that of the ordinary. For $x \sim 0.2$, the scale
$\lambda_{max}$ becomes galactic. Mirror dark matter therefore leads to
bottom-up large scale structure formation, similar to conventional cold dark
matter, for $x \stackrel{<}{\sim} 0.2$. Indeed, the smaller the value of $x$,
the closer mirror dark matter resembles standard cold dark matter during the
linear regime. The differences pertain to scales smaller than $\lambda'_S$ in
the linear regime, and generally in the non-linear regime because mirror dark
matter is chemically complex and to some extent dissipative. Lyman-$\alpha$
forest data and the early reionisation epoch established by WMAP may hold the
key to distinguishing mirror dark matter from WIMP-style cold dark matter.

arises, however, which is that the relevant Kac-Moody algebra can be the
Lorentzian extension of a twisted affine Kac-Moody algebra, while the N=0 and

\gamma-trace anomaly of the supersymmetry current of {\cal N}=1

supergravity background can be extracted out from the ${\cal N}=2$ gauged
supergravity in five dimensions. It is shown that the reproduction of this

N}=2 bulk supersymmetry transformation converts into {\cal N}=1 superconformal
transformation on the boundary, which consists of {\cal N}=1 supersymmetry
transformation and special conformal supersymmetry (or super-Weyl)
transformation; second the supersymmetry variation of the bulk action of
five-dimensional gauged supergravity is a total derivative. The
non-compatibility of supersymmetry and the super-Weyl transformation invariance
yields the holographic supersymmetry current anomaly. Furthermore, we speculate
on that the contribution from the external gauge and gravitational background

and the existence of closed time-like curves. We first show that closed causal
curves disappear after a proper definition of the time function. We then
consider the one-loop vacuum expectation value of the stress tensor. A naive
QFT analysis yields a divergent result. We then analyze the stress tensor in
bosonic string theory, and find the same result as if the target space would be
just the Minkowski space $R^{1,d}$, suggesting a zero result for the
superstring. This leads us to propose a proper reformulation of QFT, and
recalculate the stress tensor. We find almost the same result as in Minkowski
space, except for a potential divergence at the initial time slice of the
orbifold, analogous to a spacelike Big Bang singularity. Finally, we argue that
it is possible to define local S-matrices, even if the spacetime is globally
time-nonorientable.

about the system that increases as a power of time. However, this entropy
cannot be chosen independently from the choice of coarse graining lengths and
it assigns positive dynamical entropies also to fully integrable systems. By
considering these dependencies in detail one usually will be able to

regarded as a time-dependent quantum evolution process, which gives rise to a
geometric phase. It is well known that the investigation of non-adiabatic
geometric phases ought to be performed only in the Schr\""{o}dinger picture. So,
the projections of photon spin operators onto the fixed frame of reference is
discussed in this paper. In addition, we also treat the non-normal-order spin
operators and consider the potential effects (e.g., quantum-vacuum geometric
phases) of quantum fluctuation fields arising in a curved optical fibre. The
quantum-vacuum geometric phase, which is of physical interest, can be deducted
by using the operator normal product, and the doubt of validity and
universality for the normal-normal procedure applied to time-dependent quantum
systems is thus proposed. In the Appendix, the discussion of possible

presented.

general MHS equilibria with gravity when isolated thin non-force-free flux
tubes are present. In gas-dominated environments, as in stellar photospheres,
flux tubes must expand rapidly with height to maintain pressure balance with
the cool surroundings. But in magnetically dominated environments, as in
stellar coronae, the large-scale background magnetic field determines the
average spreading of embedded flux tubes, and rigidly held flux tubes {\it
require} a specific surrounding atmosphere with a unique temperature profile
for equilibrium. The solar static equilibrium atmosphere exhibits correct
transition-region properties and the accepted base coronal temperature for the
sun's main magnetic spherical harmonic. Steady flows contribute to the overall
pressure, so equilibria with accelerated wind outflows are possible as well.
Flux tubes reflect a mathematical degeneracy in the form of non-force-free
fields, which leads to coupling in general equilibrium conditions. The
equilibrium state characterizes the system average in usual circumstances and
dynamics tend to maintain the MHS atmosphere. Outflows are produced everywhere
external to rigidly held flux tubes that refill a depleted or cool atmosphere
to the equilibrium gas profile, heating the gas compressively.

numerically integrating the equations of radiation MHD in the flux-limited
diffusion approximation. The shearing-box approximation is used, and the
vertical component of gravity is neglected. Magneto-rotational instability
(MRI) leads to turbulence in which accretion stresses are due primarily to
magnetic torques. When radiation is locked to gas over the length and time
scales of fluctuations in the turbulence, the accretion stress, density
contrast, and dissipation differ little from those in the corresponding
calculations with radiation replaced by extra gas pressure. However, when
radiation diffuses each orbit a distance that is comparable to the RMS vertical
wavelength of the MRI, radiation pressure is less effective in resisting
squeezing. Large density fluctuations occur, and radiation damping of
compressive motions converts PdV work into photon energy. The accretion stress
in calculations having a net vertical magnetic field is found to be independent
of opacity over the range explored, and approximately proportional to the
square of the net field. In calculations with zero net magnetic flux, the
accretion stress depends on the portion of the total pressure that is effective
in resisting compression. The stress is lower when radiation diffuses rapidly
with respect to the gas. We show that radiation-supported Shakura-Sunyaev disks
accreting via internal magnetic stresses are likely in their interiors to have
radiation marginally coupled to turbulent gas motions.

analysis is presented of the variation in strength, velocity and width of the

months after the X-ray detection of SN 2002ap. From a comparison of the two
XMM-Newton observations we obtain more accurate values for the X-ray luminosity
and colours of the source five days after the event, and a limit on its decline
rate. We compare its X-ray behaviour (prompt soft X-ray emission, relatively
low luminosity) with that of other Type Ic SNe, and speculate that SN 2002ap
may share some physical properties (low mass-loss rate and high-velocity
stellar wind from the progenitor star) with the candidate hypernova/GRB
progenitor SN 1998bw, but with a lower (non-relativistic) speed of the ejecta.
We suggest that the X-ray emission observed in 2002 is likely to come from the
radiatively-cooling reverse shock, at a temperature kT ~ 0.8 keV, and that this
soft component was already detected 5 d after the event because the absorbing
column density of the cool shell between the forward and reverse shocks was
only ~ 10^{20} cm^{-2}, ie, the shell was optically thin in the soft X-ray
band. The new XMM-Newton data also allowed us to continue monitoring two bright
variable sources in M74 that had reached peak luminosities > 10^{39} erg s^{-1}
in previous XMM-Newton and Chandra observations. Finally, we used two Chandra
observations from 2001 to investigate the luminosity and colour distribution of
the X-ray source population of M74, typical of moderately-active late-type

electronic structure of solids, which has been specifically adapted to treat
many-body effects in a more rigorous way than many existing ab-initio methods.
We start from a standard band-structure calculation for an effective
one-particle Hamiltonian approximately describing the material of interest.
This yields a suitable set of one-particle basis functions, from which well
localized Wannier functions can be constructed using a method proposed by
Marzari and Vanderbilt. Within this (minimal) basis of localized Wannier
functions the matrix elements of the non-interacting (one-particle) Hamiltonian
as well as the Coulomb matrix elements can be calculated. The result is a
many-body Hamiltonian in second quantization with parameters determined from
first principles calculations for the material of interest. The Hamiltonian is
in the form of a multi-band Hamiltonian in second quantization (a kind of
extended, multi-band Hubbard model) such that all the standard many-body
methods can be applied. We explicitly show how this approach can be solved in
the simplest many-body approximation, the mean-field Hartree-Fock approximation
(HFA), which takes into account exact exchange and corrects for
self-interaction effects.

  We then extend this idea to the standard model, stueckelberging the

an infrared regulator for the photon in the standard electroweak theory, along
with a modification of the weak mixing angle accompanied by a plethora of new

a pseudo-vector coupling. Finally, we review the historical influence of
Stueckelberg's 1938 idea, which led to applications in many areas not

to generalize the Stueckelberg trick to the non-Abelian case with the aim to

$dx/dt = f(x,\lambda)$, $x \in \R^n$, involving one or several constant real

$(x,\lambda)$, we observe a foliation of the total phase space by constant
$\lambda$. Frequently, the presence of a trivial stationary solution $x=0$ is
also imposed: $0 = f(0,\lambda)$.
  Bifurcation without parameters, in contrast, discards the foliation by a
constant parameter $\lambda$. Instead, we consider systems $dx/dt = f(x,y),
dy/dt = g(x,y)$. Standard bifurcation theory then corresponds to the special
case $y=\lambda, g=0$. To preserve only the trivial solution $x=0$, instead, we
only require $0 = f(0,y) = g(0,y)$ for all $y$. A rich dynamic phenomenology
arises, when normal hyperbolicity of the trivial stationary manifold $x=0$
fails, due to zero or purely imaginary eigenvalues of the Jacobian $f_x(0,y)$.
  Specifically, we address the cases of failure of normal hyperbolicity due to
a simple eigenvalue zero, a simple purely imaginary pair (Hopf bifurcation
without parameters), a double eigenvalue zero (Takens-Bogdanov bifurcation
without parameters), and due to a double eigenvalue zero with additional time
reversal symmetries.

exchange transformations, some striking new power laws for the ergodic
integrals of generic non-exact Hamiltonian flows on higher genus surfaces. In
Zorich's later work and in a joint paper authored by M. Kontsevich, Zorich and
Kontsevich were able to explain conjecturally most of Zorich's discoveries by
relating them to the ergodic theory of Teichm\""uller flows on moduli spaces of
Abelian differentials. In this article, we outline a generalization of the
Kontsevich-Zorich framework to a class of `renormalizable' flows on
`pseudo-homogeneous' spaces. We construct for such flows a `renormalization
dynamics' on an appropriate `moduli space', which generalizes the Teichm\""uller
flow. If a flow is renormalizable and the space of smooth functions is
`stable', in the sense that the Lie derivative operator on smooth functions has
closed range, the behaviour of ergodic integrals can be analyzed, at least in
principle, in terms of an Oseledec's decomposition for a `renormalization
cocycle' over the bundle of `basic currents' for the orbit foliation of the
flow. This approach was suggested by the author's proof of the
Kontsevich-Zorich conjectures and it has since been applied, in collaboration
with L. Flaminio, to prove that the Zorich phenomenon generalizes to several
classical examples of volume preserving, uniquely ergodic, parabolic flows such
as horocycle flows and nilpotent flows on homogeneous 3-manifolds.

has been understood that the natural category for classical ergodic theory
would be probability measure preserving actions of discrete amenable groups. A
conclusion of this work is that all such actions on nonatomic Lebesgue
probability spaces were orbit equivalent. From this foundation two broad
developements have been built. First, a full generalization of the various
equivalence theories, including Ornstein's isomorphism theorem itself, exists.
Second, one can use the characterization of discrete amenable actions as those
which are orbit equivalent to a action of \Z to lift theorems from actions of
\Z to those of arbitrary amenable groups.

strange attractors may be subdivided into the following three groups:
hyperbolic, pseudo-hyperbolic ones and quasi-attractors. For the first ones the
description of bifurcations that lead to the appearance of Smale-Williams
solenoids and Anosov-type attractors is given. The definition and the
description of the attractors of the second class are introduced in the general
case. It is pointed out that the main feature of the attractors of this class
is that they contain no stable orbits. An etanol example of such
pseudo-hyperbolic attractors is the Lorenz one. We give the conditions of their
existence. In addition we present a new type of the spiral attractor that
requires countably many topological invariants for the complete description of
its structure. The common property of quasi-attractors and pseudo-hyperbolic
ones is that both admit homoclinic tangencies of the trajectories. The
difference between them is due to quasi-attractors may also contain a countable
subset of stable periodic orbits. The quasi-attractors are the most frequently
observed limit sets in the problems of nonlinear dynamics. However, one has to
be aware that the complete qualitative analysis of dynamical models with
homoclinic tangencies cannot be accomplished.

by Lov\'asz. This result is now known as the perfect graph theorem. The strong
perfect graph conjecture (SPGC) states that a graph is perfect if and only if
it does not contain an odd hole or its complement. The SPGC has attracted a lot

identified. The first, due to the quantum interference terms is parity. This
symmetry property characterizes entanglement. Second is correlation due to
conservation of angular momentum. The two contributions are equal and have the
same functional form. When entanglement is present, Bell's inequalities are
violated but when parity is destroyed by disentanglement, Bell's inequalities
are satisfied. It is shown tht some experiments which have hiterto been

The results are obtained using a new optimal fast estimator (Pen 2003)
deprojected using minimum variance and SVD techniques. We show the resulting
3-D power spectra for dark matter and galaxies, and their covariance for the
VIRMOS-DESCART weak lensing shear and galaxy data. The survey is most sensitive
to nonlinear scales k_NL ~ 1 h Mpc^-1. On these scales, our 3-D power spectrum
of dark matter is in good agreement with the RCS 3-D power spectrum found by
(Hoekstra et al 2002). Our galaxy power is similar to that found by the 2MASS
survey, and larger than that of SDSS, APM and RCS, consistent with the expected
difference in galaxy population.
  We find an average bias b=1.24+/-0.18 for the I selected galaxies, and a
cross correlation coefficient r=0.75+/-0.23. Together with the power spectra,
these results optimally encode the entire two point information about dark
matter and galaxies, including galaxy-galaxy lensing. We address some of the
implications regarding galaxy halos and mass-to-light ratios. The best fit
``halo'' parameter h=r/b=0.57+/-0.16, suggesting that dynamical masses
estimated using galaxies systematically underestimate total mass.
  Ongoing surveys, such as the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope-Legacy survey
will significantly improve on the dynamic range, and future photometric
redshift catalogs will allow tomography along the same principles.

These observations confirm that ULIRGs are intrinsically faint X-rays sources,
their observed X-ray luminosities being typically L(2-10 keV)<1E42-43 erg/s,
whereas their bolometric luminosities are L>1E45 erg/s. In all sources we find
evidence for thermal emission from hot plasma with kT~0.7keV, dominating the
X-ray spectra below 1keV, and likely associated with a nuclear or circumnuclear
starburst. This thermal emission appears uncorrelated with the FIR luminosity,
suggesting that,in addition to the ongoing rate of star formation, other
parameters may also affect it. The soft X-ray emission appears to be extended
on a scale of ~30kpc for Mkn231 and IRAS19254-7245, possible evidence of
galactic superwinds. In these 2 sources, in IRAS20551-4250 and IRAS23128-5919
we find evidence for the presence of hidden AGNs, while a minor AGN
contribution may be suspected also in IRAS20100-4156. In particular, we have
detected a strong Fe line at 6.4keV in the spectrum of IRAS19254-7245 and a
weaker one in Mkn231, suggestive of deeply buried AGNs. For the other sources,
the X-ray luminosities and spectral shapes are consistent with hot thermal
plasma and X-ray binary emissions of mainly starburst origin. We find that the
2-10keV luminosities in these sources, most likely due to high-mass X-ray
binaries, are correlated with L_FIR: both luminosities are good indicators of
the current global SFR in the galaxy. The composite nature of ULIRGs is then
confirmed, with hints for a predominance of the starburst over the AGN
phenomenon in these objects.

The data are however better described as the sum of three discrete distribution
functions, each of which has a small or zero internal gradient. The changing

explore several ways to detect the disk presence through its interaction with
the cluster. First of these is the eclipses of close bright stars by the disk.
The second is the increase in the infrared flux of the disk due to illumination
of its surface by such stars during close passages. Finally the surface
brightness of the star cluster should show an anisotropy that depends on the
inclination angle of the disk. We apply the first two of the methods to Sgr A*,
the super massive black hole in our Galactic Center. Using the orbital
parameters of the close star S2, we strongly rule out a disk optically thick in
the near infrared unless it has a relatively large inner hole. For disks with
no inner holes, we estimate that the data permit a disk with infrared optical
depth no larger than about 0.01. Such a disk could also be responsible for the
detected 3.8 microns excess in the spectrum of S2. The constraints on the disk
that we obtain here can be reconciled with the disk parameters needed to
explain the observed X-ray flares if dust particles in the disk have sizes
greater than ~ 30 microns. The destruction of small dust particles by strong UV

evidence of evolution. This enables us to constrain the redshift evolution of
the black hole mass-luminosity ratio to be ~(1+z)^beta with beta ~< 1, much
less than the ~(1+z)^3 evolution seen in QSO luminosity evolution. Assuming
that the motion of the broad line region gas is Keplerian and that its radius
depends on the QSO luminosity, our models indicate that the observed weak
redshift dependence is too small for the observed QSO luminosity function to be
due to the evolution of a single long-lived population of sources.

z ~ 5 to z ~ 2.7 for flat geometries (Omega_M+Omega_LAMBDA=1.0). Simple scaling
laws for this cosmology predict that size evolution goes as (1+z)^{-1},

less evolution than was previously reported, and therefore a higher luminosity

color cuts and surface brightness thresholds (e.g., due to the (1+z)^4 cosmic

varies with resolution, softening, and radius within isolated equilibrium and
non-equilibrium cuspy haloes. We then attempt to determine how this numerical
effect propagates through a merging hierarchy by measuring the local relaxation
rates of each particle throughout the hierarchical formation of a dark matter
halo. The central few percent of the final structures - a region which one
might naively think is well resolved at the final time since the haloes
contains about 10^6 particles - suffer from high degrees of relaxation. It is
not clear how to interpret the effects of the accumulated relaxation rate, but
we argue that it describes a region within which one should be careful about
trusting the numerical results. Substructure haloes are most affected by
relaxation since they contain few particles at a constant energy for the entire
simulation. We show that relaxation will flatten a cusp in just a few mean
relaxation times of a halo. We explore the effect of resolution on the degree
of relaxation and we find that increasing N slowly reduces the degree of
relaxation proportional to N^{-0.25} rather than proportional to N. Simulated
with the same relative mass resolution (i.e. equal numbers of particles)
cluster mass objects suffer significantly more relaxation than galaxy mass
objects since they form relatively late and therefore more of the particles
spend more time in small N haloes.

debate. The diverse attempts to identify or at least constrain the physical
processes involved in the explosion have been only partially successful so far.
In this paper we propose to use the thermal X-ray emission from young supernova
remnants originated in Type Ia events to extract relevant information
concerning the explosions themselves. We have produced a grid of thermonuclear
supernova models representative of the paradigms currently under debate: pure
deflagrations, delayed detonations, pulsating delayed detonations and
sub-Chandrasekhar explosions, using their density and chemical composition
profiles to simulate the interaction with the surrounding ambient medium and
the ensuing plasma heating, non-equilibrium ionization and thermal X-ray
emission of the ejecta. Key observational parameters such as electron
temperatures, emission measures and ionization time scales are presented and
discussed. We find that not only is it possible to identify the explosion
mechanism from the spectra of young Type Ia Supernova Remnants, it is in fact
necessary to take the detailed ejecta structure into account if such spectra
are to be modeled in a self-consistent way. Neither element line flux ratios
nor element emission measures are good estimates of the true ratios of ejected
masses, with differences of as much as two or three orders of magnitude for a
given model. Comparison with observations of the Tycho SNR suggests a delayed
detonation as the most probable explosion mechanism. Line strengths, line
ratios, and the centroid of the Fe Kalpha line are reasonably well reproduced
by a model of this kind.

only detected at energies below 2 keV and, in 2002 May, reached count rates
comparable to those of the nine ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) detected in
these galaxies. Spectral fits of the SSS data give acceptable results only for
a $\sim$100--90 eV blackbody spectrum with an intrinsic absorption column of
$N_{\rm H} \sim 2-3 \times 10^{21} \rm cm^{-2}$. For a distance of 19 Mpc, the
best-fit observed luminosity increases from 1.7$\times 10^{38}$\ergs in 1999
December to 8.0$\times 10^{38}$\ergs in 2002 May. The intrinsic,

$\ga$100\msun. However, if the emission is blackbody at all times, as suggested
by the steep soft spectrum, the radiating area would have to vary by a factor
of $\sim10^3$, inconsistent with gravitational energy release from within a few
Schwarzschild radii of a black hole. Viable explanations for the observed
properties of the SSS are provided by anisotropic emission from either an

flow velocity into the shock boundary is too low, a Keplerian disk region will
not be formed. We develop a model for the formation of disks in magnetic
rotators through the processes of fill-up and diffusion into Keplerian orbits.
At the end of the fill-up stage the density of the disk increases significantly
and the magnetic force in the disk becomes negligible. We derive analytical
expressions for the inner and outer radii of Keplerian disks in terms of the
stellar rotation rate. A disk can form if the meridional component Bm of the
field at the stellar surface is larger than a minimum value. The radial extent
of the Keplerian region becomes larger for larger values of Bm and is largest
when Bm equals an optimal value. The strengths of the minimum fields required
for Keplerian disk formation in B-type stars varies from order 1G to 10G. In
O-type stars they must be of order 500G. Also, we suggest that the stellar

The experimentally observed Jahn-Teller phase transition at Tc=370K can not be

accurately by LDA.
  Electron correlations beyond LDA are essential to lift the degeneracy of the
singly occupied Ti t2g orbital. Although the on-site Coulomb correlations are
important, the direction of the t2g-level splitting is determined by the
dipole-dipole interactions. The LDA+U functional predicts an aniferromagnetic
insulator with an orbitally ordered ground state. The input parameters U=8.1 eV

the TiF$_6^{2-}$ ion using the molecular NRLMOL code. We estimate the
Heisenberg exchange constant for spin-1/2 on a cubic lattice to be
approximately 24 K. The symmetry lowering energy in LDA+U is about 900 K per

electric field (CEF) level splits into three levels by a mean field with the

any collinear order of \Gamma_{5u}-type octupole moment accompanies the
\Gamma_{5g}-type ferro-quadrupole order, and the coupling of the quadrupole
moment with the lattice induces the distortion. The cusp in the magnetization
at the phase transition is reproduced, but the internal magnetic field due to
the octupole moment is smaller than the observed one by an order of magnitude.

different decorations of inflated decagons. However, if the original decagon
region is divided into ``equivalent'' rhombus Penrose tiles, typed-decagon
arrangements in the tiles (of the same shape) become identical for the fourfold

present paper we perform a critical reassessment of this issue. We show that

it cannot account for the measured amplitude.
  In addition, we point out that the reduction of the gluon fusion vertex for

the validity of the vector dominance (VD) of the electromagnetic form factor of

of this, we examine the neutralino lower mass bound obtained from supernova

annihilation and nucleon-nucleon binostrahlung. For electron-positron
annihilation, we take into account the radial and temporal dependence of the
temperature and degeneracy of the supernova core. We also separately consider
the Raffelt criterion and show that the two lead to consistent results. For the
case of bino production in $NN$ collisions, we use the Raffelt criterion and
incorporate recent advances in the understanding of the strong-interaction part
of the calculation in order to estimate the impact of bino radiation on the
SN1987A neutrino signal. Considering these two bino production channels allows
us to determine separate and combined limits on the neutralino mass as a
function of the selectron and squark masses. For $M_\lsp \sim 100 \mev$ values
of the selectron mass between 300 and 900 GeV are inconsistent with the
supernova neutrino signal. On the other hand, in contrast to previous works, we
find that SN1987A provides almost no bound on the squark masses: only a small
window of values around 300 GeV can be excluded, and even then this window
closes once $M_\lsp \gsim 20 \mev$.

simultaneously in two planes in AdS_5 with equal spins S. This solution is a
direct generalization of a two-spin flat-space solution where the string
rotates in two orthogonal planes while always lying on a 3-sphere. Similar
solution exists for a string rotating in S^5: it is parametrized by the angular
momentum J of the center of mass and the two equal SO(6) angular momenta
J_2=J_3=J' in the two rotation planes. The remarkably simple case is of J=0
where the energy depends on J' as E=[(2J')^2 + {\l}]^{1/2} with {\l}being the
string tension or `t Hooft coupling. We discuss interpolation of the E(J')
relation to weak coupling by identifying the N=4 SYM theory operator that
should be dual to the corresponding semiclassical string state and utilizing
existing results for its perturbative anomalous dimension. This opens up a
possibility of studying AdS/CFT duality in this new non-BPS sector. We also
investigate stability of these classical solutions under small perturbations

of order 1/r^4 when compactified on two dimensions having Kaluza-Klein masses
of order 1/r. In the models we examine supersymmetry is broken by the presence
of non-supersymmetric 3-branes (on one of which we live). If r were
sub-millimeter in size, such a cosmological constant could describe the
recently-discovered dark energy. A successful self-tuning mechanism would
therefore predict a connection between the observed size of the cosmological
constant, and potentially observable effects in sub-millimeter tests of gravity
and at the Large Hadron Collider. We do find self tuning inasmuch as 3-branes
can quite generically remain classically flat regardless of the size of their
tensions, due to an automatic cancellation with the curvature and dilaton of
the transverse two dimensions. We argue that in some circumstances
six-dimensional supersymmetry might help suppress quantum corrections to this
cancellation down to the bulk supersymmetry-breaking scale, which is of order
1/r. We finally examine an explicit realization of the mechanism, in which
3-branes are inserted into an anomaly-free version of Salam-Sezgin gauged 6D
supergravity compactified on a 2-sphere with nonzero magnetic flux. This
realization is only partially successful due to a topological constraint which
relates bulk couplings to the brane tension, although we give arguments why
these relations may be stable against quantum corrections.

are the source of the ``new-type'' relations on the injection of the absolute
Galois group into the Grothendieck-Teichmuller group. We make explicit how to
get from a general Belyi-extending map to formula for its associated invariant
which can be implemented in a computer algebra package. We give an example of a
new invariant differing on two dessins which have the same values for the other
readily computable invariants.

bounded by e. Motivated by a conjecture by M. Steel, we show that if 2 (1 - 2

having n leaves, can be reconstructed from O(log n) samples (characters) at the
leaves. On the other hand, we show that if 2 (1 - 2 e) (1 - 2 e) < 1, then
there exist topologies which require at least poly(n) samples for
reconstruction.

closed system with discrete eigenstates and the coupling matrix $W$ between
discrete states and continuum. The eigenvalues of ${\cal H}$ determine the
poles of the $S$ matrix. The coupling matrix elements $\tilde W_k^{cc'}$
between the eigenstates $k$ of ${\cal H}$ and the continuum may be very
different from the coupling matrix elements $W_k^{cc'}$ between the eigenstates
of $H$ and the continuum. Due to the unitarity of the $S$ matrix, the
$\TW_k^{cc'}$ depend on energy in a non-trivial manner, that conflicts with the
assumptions of some approaches to reactions in the overlapping regime. Explicit
expressions for the wave functions of the resonance states and for their phases
in the neighbourhood of, respectively, avoided level crossings in the complex
plane and double poles of the $S$ matrix are given.

hydrogen atom in the fully spin-dependent and relativistic framework of the
Dirac equation, and in the nonrelativistic but spin-dependent framework of the
Pauli equation. Eigenstates are chosen which are simultaneous eigenstates of
the energy H, total angular momentum M, and z component of the total angular
momentum M_z. We find the trajectories of the electron, and show that in these
eigenstates, motion is circular about the z-axis, with constant angular
velocity. We compute the rates of revolution for the ground (n=1) state and the
n=2 states, and show that there is agreement in the relevant cases between the
Dirac and Pauli results, and with earlier results on the Schrodinger equation.

"quant-ph/0304200","Kurt Jacobs","Kurt Jacobs","On the properties of information gathering in quantum and classical
  measurements","13 pages, revtex4",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The information provided by a classical measurement is unambiguously
determined by the mutual information between the output results and the
measured quantity. However, quantum mechanically there are at least two notions
of information gathering which can be considered, one characterizing the
information provided about the initial preparation, useful in communication,
and the other characterizing the information about the final state, useful in
state-preparation and control. Here we are interested in understanding the
properties of these measures, and the information gathering capacities of
quantum and classical measurements. We provide a partial answer to the question
`in what sense does information gain increase with initial uncertainty?' by
showing that, for classical and quantum measurements which are symmetric with
respect to reversible transformations of the state space, the information gain
regarding the initial state always increases with the observer's initial
uncertainty. In addition, we calculate the capacity of all unitarily covariant
and commutative permutation-symmetric measurements for obtaining classical
information. While it is the von Neumann entropy of the effects which appears
in the latter capacity, it is the subentropy which appears in the expression
for the former.

results for the quadrature variances of a pair of generated modes are obtained
by using the exact steady-state solution of Fokker-Planck equation for the
complex P-quasiprobability distribution function. We find a simple expression
for the squeezed variances in the near-threshold range and conclude that the
maximal two-mode squeezing reaches 50% relative to the level of vacuum
fluctuations and is achieved at the pump field intensity close to the
generation threshold. The distinction between the degree of two-mode squeezing
for monostable and bistable operational regimes is cleared up.

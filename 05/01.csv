in the general interstellar dust in galaxies (the 'infrared cirrus' component).
Such emission is characterized by relatively low optical depths of dust and by
cool (< 30 K) dust temperatures. The model incorporates the stellar population
synthesis model of Bruzual & Charlot and the dust model of Siebenmorgen &
Krugel which includes the effects of small grains/PAHs. We apply the model to
fit the optical to submillimeter spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of nearby
galaxies which are dominated by cirrus emission and find that our simple model
is quite adequate to explain the observed SEDs.
  We also, more controversially, apply this cirrus model to the SEDs of high
redshift sources detected in blank field submillimeter surveys with SCUBA.
Surprisingly, an excellent fit is found for many of these sources, with typical
values for the optical depth A_V and the surface brightness of the stellar
radiation field psi being only a factor 2-3 higher than for nearby galaxies.
This increase is not unreasonable given the expected evolution of dust optical
depth in currently favoured star-formation history models.
  We conclude that the tendency to interpret the high-z SCUBA galaxies as very
highly obscured starbursts may be premature and that these galaxies may be more
closely linked to optically selected high redshift galaxies than previously
assumed.

potential, a prior period of matter or radiation domination, or an oscillating
scalar field which couples to the inflaton. We reanalyze the full WMAP
parameter space supplemented by a low-k cutoff for P(k). The temperature
correlations by themselves are better fit by a cutoff spectrum, but including
the TE temperature-polarization spectrum reduces this preference to a 1.4 sigma
effect. Inclusion of large scale structure data does not change the conclusion.
If taken seriously, the low-k cutoff is correlated with optical depth so that
reionization occurs even earlier than indicated by the WMAP analysis.

been of the variance of the projected surface density of matter, which

This measurement of the fluctuations is insensitive to the total mass content,
like using waves on the ocean to measure its depths. But when the depth is
shallow as happens near a beach, waves become skewed. Similarly, a measurement
of skewness in the projected matter distribution directly measures the total
matter content of the universe. While skewness has already been convincingly
detected, its constraint on cosmology is still weak. We address optimal
analyses for the CFHT Legacy Survey in the presence of noise. We show that a
compensated Gaussian filter with a width of 2.5 arc minutes optimizes the

significantly better than other filters which have been considered in the

mass star in the presence of an outer-lying intermediate mass companion. The
overall goal is to estimate the fraction of binary systems that allow
Earth-like planets to remain stable over long time scales. We numerically
determine the planet's ejection time $\tauej$ over a range of companion masses
($M_C$ = 0.001 -- 0.5 $M_\odot$), orbital eccentricities $\epsilon$, and
semi-major axes $a$. This suite of $\sim40,000$ numerical experiments suggests
that the most important variables are the companion's mass $M_C$ and periastron
distance $\rmin$ = $a(1-\epsilon)$ to the primary star. At fixed $M_C$, the
ejection time is a steeply increasing function of $\rmin$ over the range of
parameter space considered here (although the ejection time has a distribution
of values for a given $\rmin$). Most of the integration times are limited to 10
Myr, but a small set of integrations extend to 500 Myr. For each companion
mass, we find fitting formulae that approximate the mean ejection time as a
function of $\rmin$. These functions can then be extrapolated to longer time
scales. By combining the numerically determined ejection times with the
observed distributions of orbital parameters for binary systems, we estimate
that (at least) 50 percent of binaries allow an Earth-like planet to remain
stable over the 4.6 Gyr age of our solar system.

particular regions of this SNR (including the bright northwestern and
southwestern rims, the northeastern rim and the interior diffuse emission) over
the approximate energy range of 0.5 through 30 keV. Based on the parameters of
the best fit to the spectra using the SRCUT model, we estimate the maximum
energy of cosmic-ray electrons accelerated by the rims of G347.3-0.5 to be
19-25 TeV, assuming a magnetic field strength of 10 microGauss. We present a
broadband (radio to gamma-ray) photon energy flux-spectrum for the northwestern

magnetic field strength to fit the spectrum. Our fit derived from this model
yields a maximum energy of only 8.8 TeV for the accelerated cosmic-ray

ratio of volumes for TeV emission and X-ray emission (approximately 1000) is
too large to be physically acceptable. We argue that neither non-thermal
bremsstrahlung nor neutral pion decay can adequately describe the TeV emission
from this rim, and therefore the physical process responsible for this emission
is currently uncertain. Finally, we compare the gross properties of G347.3-0.5

$z=0.1685$, and is therefore very bright and easy to monitor, making it the
most well studied afterglow to date. It shows a supernova bump in the light
curve, with a spectrum very similar to SN 1998bw, thus establishing with much
better confidence the connection between GRBs and core collapse SNe. There are
also two important physical characteristics that make this burst especially
interesting, aside from its remarkably low redshift. First, unlike most GRB
afterglows, the light curve of GRB 030329 shows a very large variability a few
days after the burst. These fluctuations show a roughly constact amplitude, and
a constant duration $\Delta t$, while $\Delta t/t$ decreases with time $t$.
Second, its $\gamma$-ray energy output and X-ray luminosity at $10 $hr are a
factor of $\sim 20$ and $\sim 30$, respectively, below the average value around
which most GRBs are narrowly clustered. We consider several interpretations for
the variability in the light curve, in the context of different physical
mechanisms, and find that the most likely cause is refreshed shocks, i.e. slow
shells that are ejected from the source and catch up with the afterglow shock
at late times. In GRB 030329 this happens after the jet break, which implies an
approximately constant duration $\Delta t$ of the bumps, in agreement with the
observations. This interpretation also explains the anomalously low initial
energy of this burst, as the total energy of the afterglow shock is increased
by a factor of $\sim 10$ due to the refreshed shocks, thus bringing the total
energy output close to the average value for all GRBs.

  A major obstacle is large uncertainties in the derived BAL column densities
because of partial coverage of the background light source. In this preliminary
report, we circumnavigate those uncertainties by making a simple assumption --
that the relative metal abundances are roughly solar. In this case, the PV
1118,1128 multiplet should have at least 500 times lower optical depth than CIV
1549,1551. Nonetheless, a PV BAL is present in at least half of the
well-measured BALQSOs we studied. We conclude that the strong lines of abundant
species like CIV are typically very optically thick. The total BAL column
densities are N_H > 10^22 cm^-2 (for solar overall metallicity), and they might
be comparable to the X-ray absorbers, of order 10^23 cm^-2, if the BAL gas is
sufficiently ionized. If the column densities in outflowing BAL gas are, in
fact, as large as the X-ray absorbers, it would present a serious challenge to
models of radiatively-driven BAL winds.

extend the redshift range of consistently observed SN Ia to z~1, where the
signature of cosmological effects has the opposite sign of some plausible
systematic effects. Consequently, these measurements not only provide another
quantitative confirmation of the importance of dark energy, but also constitute
a powerful qualitative test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration.

also find that our very low metallicity five solar-mass model, with
[Fe/H]=-4.01, does not reach the RGB - it goes directly to the helium burning
phase. It does not experience the first dredge-up either. This is not a new
finding but it will have an effect on the surface chemical evolution of the
stars and should alter the nucleosynthetic yields that we are currently
calculating. Our higher metallicity stars, with a globular cluster composition
at [Fe/H]= -1.40, do experience all the standard phases of evolution but also
have significantly higher surface temperatures and luminosities compared to
solar metallicity stars. Their internal temperatures are also higher which
should again effect the final nucleosynthetic yields.

(IMF) biased heavily toward WD precursors (1 < m/Msol < 8), at least in the
early Universe, would be necessary in generating such a halo. Within the
framework of homogeneous, closed-box models of Galaxy formation, such biased
IMFs lead to an unavoidable overproduction of carbon and nitrogen relative to
oxygen (as measured against the abundance patterns in the oldest stars of the
Milky Way). Using a three-dimensional Tree N-body smoothed particle
hydrodynamics code, we study the dynamics and chemical evolution of a galaxy
with different IMFs. Both invariant and metallicity-dependent IMFs are

comprised of ~5% (by mass) of WDs are not supported by our simulations, mass

between MS channel and lipid bilayer to the energy barrier separating open and

this model from the cascade of aftershocks of each past earthquake. Due to the

study the regime where the distribution of fertilities mu is characterized by a

Generalized Vector Dominance Model to take into account coherence effects for
two distinctive limits - the soft interactions for production of $\rho$ and
$\rho'$-mesons and the color transparency regime for production of charmonium

the process of coherent dijet photoproduction and hard diffractive processes in
general for probing the onset of BBL and measuring the light-cone wave function

by market fluctuations. Mathematics has emerged as the leading discipline to
address fundamental questions in finance as asset pricing model and hedging
strategies. History began with the paradigm of zero-risk introduced by Black &
Scholes stating that any random amount to be paid in the future may be
replicated by a dynamical portfolio. In practice, the lack of information leads
to ill-posed problems when model calibrating. The real world is more complex
and new pricing and hedging methodologies have been necessary. This challenging
question has generated a deep and intensive academic research in the 20 last
years, based on super-replication (perfect or with respect to confidence level)
and optimization. In the interplay between theory and practice, Monte Carlo
methods have been revisited, new risk measures have been back-tested. These
typical examples give some insights on how may be used mathematics in financial

These rhythms have been closely associated with different behavioral and
cognitive states, but it is still unknown how the nervous system makes use of
these rhythms to perform functionally important tasks. To address those
questions, it is first useful to understood in a mechanistic way the origin of
the rhythms, their interactions, the signals which create the transitions among
rhythms, and the ways in which rhythms filter the signals to a network of
neurons. This talk discusses how dynamical systems have been used to
investigate the origin, properties and interactions of rhythms in the nervous
system. It focuses on how the underlying physiology of the cells and synapses
of the networks shape the dynamics of the network in different contexts,
allowing the variety of dynamical behaviors to be displayed by the same
network. The work is presented using a series of related case studies on
different rhythms. These case studies are chosen to highlight mathematical
issues, and suggest further mathematical work to be done. The topics include:
different roles of excitation and inhibition in creating synchronous assemblies
of cells, different kinds of building blocks for neural oscillations, and
transitions among rhythms. The mathematical issues include reduction of large
networks to low dimensional maps, role of noise, global bifurcations, use of
probabilistic formulations.

  Riemann",,"Proceedings of the ICM, Beijing 2002, vol. 3, 923--934",,,"math.HO",,"  In the 1850s Weierstrass succeeded in solving the Jacobi inversion problem
for the hyper-elliptic case, and claimed he was able to solve the general
problem. At about the same time Riemann successfully applied the geometric
methods that he set up in his thesis (1851) to the study of Abelian integrals,
and the solution of Jacobi inversion problem. In response to Riemann's
achievements, by the early 1860s Weierstrass began to build the theory of
analytic functions in a systematic way on arithmetical foundations, and to
present it in his lectures. According to Weierstrass, this theory provided the
foundations of the whole of both elliptic and Abelian function theory, the
latter being the ultimate goal of his mathematical work. Riemann's theory of
complex functions seems to have been the background of Weierstrass's work and
lectures. Weierstrass' unpublished correspondence with his former student
Schwarz provides strong evidence of this. Many of Weierstrass' results,
including his example of a continuous non-differentiable function as well as
his counter-example to Dirichlet principle, were motivated by his criticism of
Riemann's methods, and his distrust in Riemann's ``geometric fantasies''.
Instead, he chose the power series approach because of his conviction that the
theory of analytic functions had to be founded on simple ""algebraic truths"".
Even though Weierstrass failed to build a satisfactory theory of functions of
several complex variables, the contradiction between his and Riemann's
geometric approach remained effective until the early decades of the 20$^{th}$
century.

Pomeron exchange process and contains the terms that govern the spin-spin and
spin-orbital interactions.
  We show that these terms are responsible for the spin-flip transitions at
forward photoproduction angles and appear in the angular distributions of
$\phi\to K^+K^-$ -decay in reactions with unpolarized and polarized photon
beams.
  At large momentum transfers, the main contribution to the $\phi$-meson
photoproduction is found to be due to the excitation of nucleon resonances.
  Combined analysis of $\omega$ and $\phi$ photoproduction indicates strong
OZI-rule violation in $\phi NN^*$ - couplings.
  We also show that the spin observables are sensitive to the dynamics of
$\phi$-meson photoproduction at large angles and could help distinguish
different theoretical models of nucleon resonances.
  Predictions for spin effects in $\phi$-meson photoproduction are presented
for future experimental tests.

iterative schemes recently proposed for Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)
purpose is examined. In all these schemes, the solution of the centred-implicit
non-linear equation is approached by an iterative fixed-point algorithm,
preconditioned by a simple, constant in time, linear operator. A general
methodology for assessing analytically the stability of these schemes on
canonical problems for a vertically unbounded atmosphere is presented. The
proposed method is valid for all the equation systems usually employed in NWP.
However, as in earlier studies, the method can be applied only in simplified
meteorological contexts, thus overestimating the actual stability that would
occur in more realistic meteorological contexts. The analysis is performed in
the spatially-continuous framework, hence allowing to eliminate the
spatial-discretisation or the boundary conditions as possible causes of the
fundamental instabilities linked to the time-scheme itself. The general method
is then shown concretely to apply to various time-discretisation schemes and
equation-systems (namely shallow-water, and fully compressible Euler
equations). Analytical results found in the literature are recovered from the
proposed method, and some original results are presented.

mutations reaches fixation. This result holds also in the presence of
deleterious mutations, and for an arbitrary number of competing mutants. We
also show that if mutations interfere, an increase in the mean number of

a considerable simplification in form of the nonlinear optical
susceptibilities. In a fully quantum theoretical treatment the validity of such

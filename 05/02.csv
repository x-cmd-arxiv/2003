abundances of distant star-forming galaxies using the ratio EWR_{23} formed
from the equivalent widths of the [O II] 3727, [O III] 4959,5007 and Hbeta
nebular emission lines. This EWR_{23} approach essentially identical to the
widely-used R_{23} method of Pagel et. al (1979). Using data from three
spectroscopic surveys of nearby galaxies, we conclude that the emission line
equivalent width ratios are a good substitute for emission line flux ratios in
galaxies with active star formation. The RMS dispersion between EWR_{23} and
the reddening-corrected R_{23} values is sigma(log(R_{23})) < 0.08 dex. This
dispersion is comparable to the emission-line measurement uncertainties for
distant galaxies in many spectroscopic galaxy surveys, and is smaller than the
uncertainties of sigma(O/H) ~ 0.15 dex inherent in strong-line metallicity
calibrations. Because equivalent width ratios are, to first order, insentitive
to interstellar reddening, emission line equivalent width ratios may actually
be superior to flux ratios when reddening corrections are not available. The
EWR_{23} method presented here is likely to be most useful for statistically
estimating the mean metallicities for large samples of galaxies to trace their
chemical properties as a function of redshift or environment. The approach
developed here is used in a companion paper (Kobulnicky et. al 2003) to measure

abundances relative to hydrogen range between 8.4<12+log(O/H)<9.0 with typical
uncertainties of 0.17 dex. The 56 DGSS galaxies collectively exhibit a
correlation between B-band luminosity and metallicity, i.e., an L-Z relation.
Subsets of DGSS galaxies binned by redshift also exhibit L-Z correlations but
with different zero points. Galaxies in the highest redshift bin (z=0.6-0.82)
are brighter by ~1 mag compared to the lowest redshift bin (z=0.26-0.40) and
brighter by ~1-2 mag compared to local (z<0.1) field galaxies. This offset from
the local L-Z relation is greatest for objects at the low-luminosity (M_B ~
-19) end of the sample, and vanishingly small for objects at the
high-luminosity end of the sample (M_B ~ -22). Thus, both the slope and zero
point of the L-Z relation appear to evolve. Either the least-luminous DGSS
field galaxies have faded by 1--2 mag due to decreasing levels of star
formation, or they have experienced an increase in the mean metallicity of the
interstellar medium by factors of 1.3--2 (0.1-0.3 dex). The relatively greater
degree of luminosity and metallicity evolution seen among the lower luminosity
(sub L*) galaxies in the last 8 Gyr implies either a more protracted assembly
process, or a more recent formation epoch compared to more luminous L*

difference in scale height is probably due in part to the lower flux limits of

that several galaxies in the sample have a highly structured eDIG morphology.
The distribution of the eDIG emission is often correlated with the locations of
the H II regions in the disk. A strong correlation is found between the star

matter and dark energy and the limitations in determining their nature from

intergalactic medium at redshifts z \sim 2.5 can be modelled (both analytically
and semi-analytically) by accounting for the non-linearities in the density
field through lognormal approximation. Our results agree with observations, and
can be used for constraining parameters related to the baryons. (ii) A simple
model based on baryon conservation, along with observational estimates of

Lyman-alpha systems in the universe. (iii) The redshift distribution of gamma
ray bursts can, in principle, be used for studying the physical conditions of
the universe before reionization epoch (which is otherwise a difficult task).
(iv) It might be possible that the dark matter and dark energy arise from the
same scalar field, provided the equation of state has a dependence on the
length scale. The possibility of using the kinematical and geometrical
measurements (such as supernova observations) for determining the nature and

extracted from these data in the reduced-temperature range
$10^{-2}\lsim\epsilon\equiv\ln(T/\Tc)\lsim1$. Such a

high-$\epsilon$ region by means of the introduction of a total-energy cutoff,
which takes into account both the kinetic energy and the quantum localization
energy of each fluctuating mode. Our results strongly suggest that at all
temperatures above Tc, including the high reduced-temperature region, the
doping mainly affects in LSxCO thin films the normal-state properties and that
its influence on the superconducting fluctuations is relatively moderate: Even
in the high-$\epsilon$ region, the in-plane paraconductivity is found to be

revisited. Previous studies have indicated that the corrections to the
Fermi-liquid forms of the specific heat and the static spin susceptibility
scale as $T^{D}$ and $T^{D-1}$, respectively (with extra logarithms for
$D=1,3$). In addition, the non-uniform spin susceptibility is expected to
depend on the bosonic momentum $Q$ in a non-analytic way, i.e., as $Q^{D-1}$
(again with extra logarithms for $D=1,3$). It is shown that these non-analytic
corrections originate from the universal singularities in the dynamical bosonic
response functions of a generic Fermi liquid. In contrast to the leading,
Fermi-liquid forms which depend on the interaction averaged over the Fermi
surface, the non-analytic corrections are parameterized by only two coupling
constants, which are the components of the interaction potential at momentum
transfers $q=0$ and $q=2k_F$. For 3D systems, a recent result of Belitz,
Kirkpatrick and Vojta for the spin susceptibility is reproduced and the issue
why a non-analytic momentum dependence of the non-uniform spin susceptibility
($Q^{2}\ln |Q|$) is \emph{not}paralleled by a non-analyticity in the $T-$
dependence ($T^2$) is clarified. For the case of a 2D system with a
finite-range interaction, explicit forms of the corrections to the specific
heat ($\propto T^2$), uniform ($\propto T$) and non-uniform ($\propto |Q|$)
spin susceptibilities are obtained. It is shown that previous calculations of
the temperature dependences of these quantities in 2D were incomplete. Some of
the results and conclusions of this paper have recently been announced in a
short communication [A. V. Chubukov and D. L. Maslov, cond-mat/0304381].

mixture via MC simulations and SCF calculations. The film surfaces interact
with the monomers via short ranged potentials and the wetting transition is of
first order. If both surfaces in a film attract the same component, capillary
condensation occurs and the critical point is close to the critical point of
the bulk. If surfaces attract different components, an interface localization
occurs which gives rise to phase diagrams with two critical points in the
vicinity of the pre-wetting critical point. The crossover between these two
types of phase diagrams as a function of the surface field asymmetry is
studied. We investigate the dependence of the phase diagram on the film
thickness D for antisymmetric surface fields. Upon decreasing the film
thickness the two critical points approach the symmetry axis of the phase
diagram, and below a certain thickness D_tri there remains only a single
critical point at symmetric composition. This corresponds to a second order
interface localisation transition even though the wetting transition is of
first order. At a specific film thickness, D_tri, tricritical behavior is
found. The behavior of antisymmetric films is compared with the phase behavior
in an antisymmetric double wedge. While the former is the analogon of the
wetting transition of a planar surface, the latter is the analogon of the
filling behavior of a single wedge. We present evidence for a second order
interface localization transition in an antisymmetric double wedge and relate
its unconventional critical behavior to the predictions of Parry et al. PRL 83

electronic ground-state molecules through photoassociation as well as through a
magnetic-field Feshbach resonance. The availability of atomic Fermi gases
provides the exciting prospect of coupling fermionic atoms to bosonic

detuning from the Feshbach resonance and can be varied over a wide range. We

radion superfield and/or some brane chiral superfields, potentially dangerous
flavor-violating soft parameters can be naturally suppressed, thereby avoiding
the SUSY flavor problem. We present some models of radion-dominated
supersymmetry breaking which yield a highly predictive form of soft parameters
in this framework.

Minkowski or de Sitter space times a two dimensional sphere, S^2. As has been
recently pointed out, it is possible to introduce 3-branes in these backgrounds
with arbitrary tension without affecting the effective four dimensional
cosmological constant, since its only effect is to induce a deficit angle in
the sphere. We show that if a monopole like configuration of a 6D U(1) gauge
field is used to produce the spontaneous compactification of the two extra
dimensions in a sphere a fine tuning between brane and bulk parameters is
reintroduced once the quantization condition for the gauge field is taken into
account, so the 4D cosmological constant depends on the brane tension. This
problem is absent if instead of the monopole we consider a four form field
strength in the bulk to obtain the required energy-momentum tensor. Also,
making use of the four form field, we generalize the solution to an arbitrary
number of dimensions (\ge 6), keeping always four noncompact dimensions and
compactifying the rest in a n-dimensional sphere. We show that a (n+1)-brane
with arbitrary tension can be introduced in this background without affecting
the effective 4D cosmological constant.

orbifold gauge theories (including possible non-trivial Scherk-Schwarz boundary
conditions) where a gauge group G is broken down to subgroups H_f at the fixed
points y=y_f. Bulk and localized anomalies, proportional to \delta(y-y_f), do
generically appear from matter propagating in the bulk. The anomaly zero-mode
that survives in the four-dimensional effective theory should be canceled by
localized fermions (except possibly for mixed U(1) anomalies). We examine in
detail the possibility of canceling localized anomalies by the Green-Schwarz
mechanism involving two- and four-forms in the bulk. The four-form can only
cancel anomalies which do not survive in the 4D effective theory: they are
called globally vanishing anomalies. The two-form may cancel a specific class
of mixed U(1) anomalies. Only if these anomalies are present in the 4D theory
this mechanism spontaneously breaks the U(1) symmetry. The examples of five and
six-dimensional Z_N orbifolds are considered in great detail. In five
dimensions the Green-Schwarz four-form has no physical degrees of freedom and
is equivalent to canceling anomalies by a Chern-Simons term. In all other
cases, the Green-Schwarz forms have some physical degrees of freedom and leave
some non-renormalizable interactions in the low energy effective theory. In
general, localized anomaly cancellation imposes strong constraints on model
building.

authors, are reviewed and translated into the framework of the relatively new
non-distributive system of Boolean fractions (also called conditional events or
conditional propositions). This system of ordered pairs (A|B) of events A, B,
can express all of the non-Boolean aspects of quantum logic without having to
resort to a more abstract formulation like Hilbert space. Such notions as
orthogonality, superposition, simultaneous verifiability, compatibility,
orthoalgebras, orthocomplementation, modularity, and the Sasaki projection
mapping are translated into this conditional event framework and their forms
exhibited. These concepts turn out to be quite adequately expressed in this
near-Boolean framework thereby allowing more natural, intuitive interpretations
of quantum phenomena. Results include showing that two conditional propositions
are simultaneously verifiable just in case the truth of one implies the
applicability of the other. Another theorem shows that two conditional
propositions (a|b) and (c|d) reside in a common Boolean sub-algebra of the
non-distributive system of conditional propositions just in case b=d, that
their conditions are equivalent. Some concepts equivalent in standard
formulations of quantum logic are distinguishable in the conditional event
algebra, indicating the greater richness of expression possible with Boolean
fractions. Logical operations and deductions in the linear subspace logic of
quantum mechanics are compared with their counterparts in the conditional event
realm. Disjunctions and implications in the quantum realm seem to correspond in
the domain of Boolean fractions to previously identified implications with
respect to various naturally arising deductive relations.

it is shown that these bounds are attainable for certain classes of channel.

where no nformation is lost to the environment, achieving the upper bound
implies that the channel is asymptotically noiseless.

simple one-dimensional dynamical systems such as a particle in a square-well

$G$. The notion of canonical momentum is carefully analysed, and the meanings
of marginal probability distributions and their recovery from the Wigner
distribution are clarified. For the case of compact $G$ an explicit definition
of the Wigner distribution is proposed, possessing all the required properties.
Geodesic curves in $G$ which help introduce a notion of the `mid point' of two
group elements play a central role in the construction.

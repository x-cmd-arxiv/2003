with given masses and orbital periods and measure their orbital elements. We
combine these findings with an estimate of the mass and period distribution of
planets determined from radial velocity surveys to predict the number and
characteristics of planets SIM would likely find. Our predictions are based on
extrapolating the mass distribution of known extrasolar planets by up to a
factor of 100. This extrapolation provides the best prediction we can make of
the actual number of planets that SIM will detect and characterize, but may
substantially over- or underestimate the frequency of Earth-mass planets,
especially if these form by a different mechanism than giant planets. We find
that SIM is likely to detect 1-5 planets with masses less than 3 M_Earth
(depending on mission parameters). SIM would measure masses and orbits with 30%
accuracy for 0-2 of these planets, but is unlikely to measure orbits with 10%
accuracy for more than one of them. SIM is likely to detect 5-25 planets with
mass less than 20 M_Earth, measure masses and orbits with 30% accuracy for 2-12
of these, and measure masses and orbits with 10% accuracy for 2-8 such planets.
SIM is likely to find 25-160 planets of all masses, depending on the observing

``Morphology--Radius'' relations for the SDSS and note that both of these

galaxy density of ~1 h_75^2 Mpc^-2 (or between 1 to 2 virial radii). One
possible physical mechanism to explain this observed critical density is the
stripping of warm gas from the halos of in-falling spiral galaxies, thus
leading to a slow strangulation of star-formation in these galaxies. This

of ``Passive'' or ``Anemic'' spiral galaxies located within the in-fall regions

branch stars, to differences in stellar environment. In this paper, the first
measurement of the (fundamental) period -- K-band luminosity relation for the
central region of a globular cluster is presented. It is based on a sample of
seven RR Lyrae stars imaged with adaptive optics. In addition, the relation for
the outer region has been reanalyzed, and is found to be in good agreement with
both the previous estimate by Longmore et al. (1990), and with the inner region
relation, especially when irregular and double-mode RR Lyrae stars are
excluded. Importantly, there is no difference between the slope of the inner
and outer region relation within measurement uncertainties, suggesting no
difference in evolutionary state (luminosity). Taking the M3 distance modulus
as 15.0 +/- 0.07mag, the period -- absolute K-band magnitude relation derived
by linear least squares fitting is: M_K = -0.96 (+/- 0.10) - 2.42 (+/- 0.16)Log

unusual properties originating from the involvement in superconductivity of two
sets of bands that are of a different dimensionality. We review, with a strong
focus on results obtained by torque magnetometry, how this leads to a complex
behavior of the anisotropic superconducting state properties. The different
dimensionality of the two sets of bands is manifested in the upper critical
field Hc2 anisotropy, which was found to strongly decrease with increasing
temperature. While the angular dependence of Hc2 follows roughly the
predictions of anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory AGLT, small, but systematic
deviations were observed near Tc. This, and the temperature dependent
anisotropy, witness a breakdown of the AGLT description of MgB2, even close to
Tc. Theoretical calculations are in qualitative agreement with the observed
angle dependence, but suggest a much lower penetration depth anisotropy at low
temperatures. Reversible torque vs angle curves in the mixed state indicate
that the penetration depth anisotropy in intermediate fields has to be higher
than currently available theoretical estimates. The observed field dependent
effective anisotropies can be accounted for qualitatively by the faster
depression of superconductivity in the more isotropic bands by the applied
field. The vortex matter phase diagram is drawn, based on measurements of the
reversible and irreversible torque in the mixed state. In the irreversible
torque, a peak effect (PE) was observed in fields of about 0.85 Hc2. History
effects of the critical current density in the PE region suggest that the PE
signifies an order-disorder transition of vortex matter.

a free boundary problem into a set of coupled partial differential equations.
Its main advantage is that it avoids front tracking by using phase fields to
locate the fronts. These fields interpolate between different constant values
in each bulk phase through diffuse interfaces of finite thickness. In
solidification, the phase fields can be understood as order parameters, and the
model is often derived to dynamically minimise a free energy functional.
However, this is not a necessary requirement, and both derivations involving a
free energy (basic solidification model) and not (first viscous fingering
model) are worked out. In any case, the model is required to reproduce the
original free boundary problem in the limit of vanishing interface thickness.
This limit and its higher order corrections, important to make quantitative
contact between simulations and experiments, are discussed for both examples.
Applications to fluctuations in solidification, the growth of liquid crystal
mesophases, and viscous fingering in Hele-Shaw cells are presented.

non-globally-hyperbolic, spacetime it is always possible to define a sensible
dynamics for a Klein-Gordon scalar field. The prescription proposed for doing
so involved viewing the spatial derivative part, $A$, of the wave operator as
an operator on a certain $L^2$ Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ and then defining a
positive, self-adjoint operator on $\mathcal H$ by taking the Friedrichs
extension (or other positive extension) of $A$. However, this analysis left
open the possibility that there could be other inequivalent prescriptions of a
completely different nature that might also yield satisfactory definitions of
the dynamics of a scalar field. We show here that this is not the case.
Specifically, we show that if the dynamics agrees locally with the dynamics
defined by the wave equation, if it admits a suitable conserved energy, and if
it satisfies certain other specified conditions, then it must correspond to the
dynamics defined by choosing some positive, self-adjoint extension of $A$ on
$\mathcal H$. Thus, subject to our requirements, the previously given
prescription is the only possible way of defining the dynamics of a scalar
field in a static, non-globally-hyperbolic, spacetime. In a subsequent paper,
this result will be applied to the analysis of scalar, electromagnetic, and
gravitational perturbations of anti-de Sitter spacetime. By doing so, we will
determine all possible choices of boundary conditions at infinity in anti-de
Sitter spacetime that give rise to sensible dynamics.

the braneworld Einstein field equations, the Weyl term is attributed to the
bulk, thus splitting the non-Einsteinian terms into `bulk' and `brane' terms.
Here by employing standard geometrical identities, we show that such a split is
non-unique, since these terms get mixed up in different formulations. An
important consequence of this non-uniqueness is that even though the full
brane-bulk systems in all such formulations are completely equivalent,
important differences can arise were one to truncate different formulations by
throwing away the associated `bulk' terms. This is particularly likely to be
the case in more general anisotropic/inhomogeneous settings with non-AdS bulks,
in which the usual truncation of the SMS (which throws away the Weyl term)
would not coincide with the full system. We emphasize that rather than
providing support for any truncation, these differences show clearly the
dangers of using any truncated equations and provide a strong argument in
favour of studying the full brane-bulk system. The different formulations we
provide also permit different ways of approaching the full brane-bulk system
which may greatly facilitate its study. An example of this is the second-order
nature of the formulations given here as opposed to the SMS's formulation which
is third-order.

Bayesian priors on the class of distributions on the real line. Since that time
there have been numerous applications to models that arise in survival analysis
subject to possible right censoring. However, unlike the Dirichlet process, the
larger class of NTR processes has not been used in a wider range of more
complex statistical applications. Here, to circumvent some of these
limitations, we describe a natural extension of NTR processes to arbitrary
Polish spaces, which we call spatial neutral to the right processes. Our
construction also leads to a new rich class of random probability measures,
which we call NTR species sampling models. We show that this class contains the
important two parameter extension of the Dirichlet process. We provide a
posterior analysis, which yields tractable NTR analogues of the
Blackwell--MacQueen distribution. Our analysis turns out to be closely related
to the study of regenerative composition structures. A new computational
scheme, which is an ordered variant of the general Chinese restaurant
processes, is developed. This can be used to approximate complex posterior
quantities. We also discuss some relationships to results that appear outside
of Bayesian nonparametrics.

problem. A novel approach is proposed for the renormalization of operators in a
manner consistent with the construction of the effective potential. To test
this approach, a one-dimensional, yet realistic, nucleon-nucleon potential is
introduced. An effective potential is then constructed by tuning its parameters
to reproduce the exact effective-range expansion and a variety of bare
operators are renormalized in a fashion compatible with this construction.
Predictions for the expectation values of these effective operators in the
ground state reproduce the results of the exact theory with remarkable accuracy
(at the 0.5% level). This represents a marked improvement over a widely
practiced approach that uses effective interactions but retains bare operators.
Further, it is shown that this improvement is more impressive as the operator
becomes more sensitive to the short-range structure of the potential. We
illustrate the main ideas of this work using the elastic form factor of the
deuteron as an example.

understanding the physical origin of their peculiarity. We review the existing
data and present new radio continuum measurements along with near-infrared
integral-field spectroscopy and molecular gas observations. The three galaxies
have low luminosities but starburst-like infrared colors; in NGC 1377, no
synchrotron emission is detected at any wavelength; in IC 1953, the observed
synchrotron component is attributable to the spiral disk alone, and is lacking
in the central regions; the radio spectrum of NGC 4491 is unusually flat. We
also compare and contrast them with NGC 4418, a heavily extinguished galaxy
which shares some attributes with them. After examining various scenarios, we
conclude that these galaxies are most likely observed within a few Myr of the
onset of an intense star formation episode after being quiescent for at least ~
100 Myr. This starburst, while heating the dust, has not produced optical
signatures nor a normal amount of cosmic rays yet. We briefly discuss the
statistics of such galaxies and what they imply for star formation surveys.

that cD galaxies can increase the lensing cross sections for long and thin arcs

helicity amplitudes, A_{SM}, and also the amplitudes A_{+} in the case of an
additional t_R --> b_L tensorial coupling of relative strength \Lambda_{+} =E_W
/2 = 53 GeV. Such an additional electroweak coupling would arise if the
observed top-quark has a large chiral weak-transition-moment. The A_{+}
amplitudes are interpreted as corresponding to the observed top-quark decays.
Three tWb-transformations A_{+}=M A_{SM}, ..., are used in simple
characterization of the values of \Lambda_{+}, and of the mass ratios m_W/m_t,
and m_b/m_t. Measurement of the sign of the \eta_L = +/- 0.46 helicity
parameter, respectively for SM/+, due to the large interference between the
W-longitudinal and W-transverse amplitudes, could exclude such a chiral
weak-transition-moment in favor of the SM prediction.

and isosinglet axial-vector correlators at Euclidean momenta is studied in the
framework of a covariant chiral quark model with nonlocal quark-quark
interactions. The gauge covariance is ensured with the help of the P-exponents,
with the corresponding modification of the quark-current interaction vertices
taken into account. The low- and high-momentum behavior of the correlators is
compared with the chiral perturbation theory and with the QCD operator product
expansion, respectively. The V-A combination of the correlators obtained in the
model reproduces quantitatively the ALEPH data on hadronic \tau decays,
transformed into the Euclidean domain via dispersion relations. The predictions
for the electromagnetic \pi^\pm - \pi^0 mass difference and for the pion
electric polarizability are also in agreement with the experimental values. The
topological susceptibility of the vacuum is evaluated as a function of the
momentum, and its first moment is predicted to be \chi'(0)\approx (50 MeV)^2.
In addition, the fulfillment of the Crewther theorem is demonstrated.

disprove a conjecture of Kwon and Lusztig stating the irreducibility of quantum

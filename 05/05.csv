investigated. To model the dynamics, we adopt the Larson-Penston (L-P) solution
and analogues with slower rates of collapse. For the chemistry, we utilize the
new standard model (NSM) with the addition of deuterium fractionation and
grain-surface reactions treated via the modified rate approach. The use of
surface reactions distinguishes the present work from our previous model. We
find that these reactions efficiently produce H2O, H2CO, CH3OH, N2, and NH3
ices. In addition, the surface chemistry influences the gas-phase abundances in
a variety of ways. The current reaction network along with the L-P solution
allows us to reproduce satisfactorily most of the molecular column densities
and their radial distributions observed in L1544. The agreement tends to worsen
with models that include strongly delayed collapse rates. Inferred radial
distributions in terms of fractional abundances are somewhat harder to
reproduce. In addition to our standard chemical model, we have also run a model
with the UMIST gas-phase chemical network. The abundances of gas-phase
S-bearing molecules such as CS and CCS are significantly affected by
uncertainties in the gas-phase chemical network. In all of our models, the
column density of N2H+ monotonically increases as the central density of the
core increases during collapse from 3 10^4 cm-3 to 3 10^7 cm-3. Thus, the
abundance of this ion can be a probe of evolutionary stage. Molecular D/H
ratios in assorted cores are best reproduced in the L-P picture with the
conventional rate coefficients for fractionation reactions. If we adopt the
newly measured and calculated rate coefficients, the D/H ratios, especially
N2D+/N2H+, become significantly lower than the observed values.

of the super massive black holes at the redshift $z_S\sim 1$ relevant to LISA,
the wave effects become important for the lens mass smaller than $\sim 10^8
M_{\odot}$. For such cases, we compute how accurately we can extract the mass
of the lens and the source position from the lensed signal. We consider two
simple lens models: the point mass lens and the SIS (Singular Isothermal
Sphere). We find that the lens mass and the source position can be determined
within $\sim 0.1% [(S/N)/10^3]^{-1}$ for the lens mass larger than $10^8
M_{\odot}$ and $\gsim 10% [(S/N)/10^3]^{-1}$ for the lens mass smaller than
$10^7 M_{\odot}$ due to the diffraction effect, where $(S/N)$ is the signal to
noise ratio of the unlensed chirp signals. For the SIS model, if the source
position is outside the Einstein radius, only a single image exists in the
geometrical optics approximation so that the lens parameters can not be
determined. While in the wave optics cases we find that the lens mass can be
determined even for $M_L < 10^8 M_{\odot}$. For the point mass lens, one can
extract the lens parameters even if the source position is far outside the
Einstein radius. As a result, the lensing cross section is an order of
magnitude larger than that for the usual strong lensing of light.

upper limits for all our candidate members, which have effective temperatures
in the range 5000>Teff>3200K, and compare these with predictions for lithium
burning and depletion provided by a number of models and also with the lithium
depletion seen in younger and older stars. We find that some models can
reproduce the lithium abundance pattern of NGC 2547 if the cluster has an age
of ~20-35Myr, which is also indicated by fits to low-mass isochrones in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. But the lack of significant further lithium
depletion between NGC 2547 and older clusters argues for an age of at least

and solved in mean-field replica symmetric approximation. It is shown that the

being identified with the temperature of the replica symmetry breaking. It is
shown that upon cooling a Lennard-Jones system, cubic clusters freeze first.
The transition temperature for icosahedral clusters is about ten per cent
lower. So the local structure of Lennard-Jones glass in the vicinity of glass

opening of a pseudogap in the DOS of the electrons below $T^*$, rendering these

the electron transport becoming ensured by electron pairs rather than by

deposited on the water surface at low temperatures, the liquid alkane forms
discrete droplets that are interconnected only by a molecularly thin film. On
increase of the temperature, there occurs a sudden jump of the film thickness
and, at this first-order transition, a mesoscopically thick layer of liquid
alkane is formed. Heating the system further leads to a divergence of the film
thickness in a continuous manner. While the long-range forces between substrate
and adsorbate are responsible for the critical transition, which occurs at the
temperature at which the Hamaker constant changes sign, it is primarily the
short-range components of the forces that bring about the first-order
transition. We calculate the Hamaker constant of the system and show how,
within a modified Cahn theory, accurate predictions of the first-order
transition temperatures can be obtained for n-alkanes (pentane and hexane) on

the dyadic partition $[2^j, 2^{j+1})$ of the positive real line, in this paper
we develop an adapted Littlewood-Paley theory for functions with spectrum in
$\Omega$. In particular, we define a natural class of Besov spaces of such
functions, $B^{p,q}_\nu$, where the role of usual derivation is now played by
the generalized wave operator of the cone $\Delta(\frac{\partial}{\partial
x})$. Our main result shows that $B^{p,q}_\nu$ consists precisely of the
distributional boundary values of holomorphic functions in the Bergman space
$A^{p,q}_\nu(T_\Omega)$, at least in a ``good range'' of indices $1\leq
q<q_{\nu,p}$. We obtain the sharp $q_{\nu,p}$ when $p\leq 2$, and conjecture a
critical index for $p>2$. Moreover, we show the equivalence of this problem
with the boundedness of Bergman projectors $P_\nu\colon L^{p,q}_\nu\to
A^{p,q}_\nu$, for which our result implies a positive answer when
$q_{\nu,p}'<q<q_{\nu,p}$. This extends to general cones previous work of the
authors in the light-cone. Finally, we conclude the paper with a finer analysis
in light-cones, for which we establish a link between our conjecture and the
cone multiplier problem. Moreover, using recent work by Tao, Vargas and Wolff,
we improve in dimension 3 the range of $q$'s for which the Bergman projection
is bounded.

initial potential $\alpha |x|^{-1}$ on the whole axis is treated and reduced to
the search for allowable self-adjoint extensions. Using the laws of
conservation as necessary conditions in the singular point alongside with
account of the analytical structure of fundamental solutions, it allows us to
receive exact expressions for the wave functions (i.e. for the boundary
conditions), scattering coefficients and the singular corrections to the
potential, as well as the corresponding bound state spectrum. It turns out that
the point $\delta$-shaped correction to the potential should be present without
fail at any choice of the allowable self-adjoint extension, moreover a form of
these corrections corresponds to the form of renormalization terms obtained in
quantum electrodynamics. Thus, the proposed method shows the unequivocal
connection among the boundary conditions, scattering coefficients and
$\delta$-shaped additions to the potential. Taken as a whole, the method
demonstrates the opportunities which arise at the analysis of the self-adjoint
extensions of the appropriate Hamilton operator. And as it concerns the
renormalization theory, the method can be treated as a generalization of the
Bogoliubov, Parasiuk and Hepp method of renormalizations.

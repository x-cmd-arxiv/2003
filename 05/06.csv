are stars caught in highly eccentric orbits around a massive (m<10^8 Mo) black
hole (MBH), whose atypically high luminosity (up to a significant fraction of
their Eddington luminosity) is powered by tidal interactions with the MBH.
Their existence follows from the presence of a mass sink, the MBH, in the
galactic center, which drives a flow of stars into nearly radial orbits to
replace those it has destroyed. We consider two limits for the stellar response
to tidal heating: surface heating with radiative cooling (""hot squeezars"") and
bulk heating with adiabatic expansion (""cold squeezars""), and calculate the
evolution of the squeezar orbit, size, luminosity and effective temperature.
The squeezar formation rate is only ~0.05 that of tidal disruption flares, but
squeezar lifetimes are many orders of magnitude longer, and so future
observations of squeezars in nearby galaxies can probe the tidal process that
feeds MBHs and the effects of extreme tides on stars. The mean number of
squeezars orbiting the Galactic MBH is estimated at 0.1-1.

nearly radial orbits to replace those it destroyed. Stars whose orbits cross
the event horizon r_s or the tidal disruption radius r_t are promptly destroyed
in an orbital period P. Stars with orbital periapse r_p slightly larger than
the sink radius q=max(r_s,r_t) may slowly spiral in due to dissipative
interactions with the MBH, e.g. gravitational wave emission, tidal heating or
accretion disk drag, with observable consequences and implications for the MBH
growth rate. Unlike prompt destruction, the inspiral time is typically >>P.
This time is limited by the same scattering process that initially deflected
the star into its eccentric orbit, since it can deflect it again to a wider
orbit where dissipation is inefficient. The ratio between slow and prompt event
rates is therefore much smaller than that implied by the ratio of
cross-sections, ~r_p/q, and so only prompt disruption contributes significantly
to the mass of the MBH. Conversely, most stars that scatter off the MBH survive
the extreme tidal interaction (""tidal scattering""). We derive general
expressions for the inspiral event rate and the mean number of inspiraling
stars, and show that the survival probability of tidally scattered stars is ~1,

GCMF like that observed in young cluster systems can be readily transformed
through dynamical processes into a bell-shaped GCMF. However,only models with
initial velocity distributions characterized by a strong radial anisotropy
increasing with the galactocentric distance are able to reproduce the observed
constancy of the GCMF at all radii.We show that such strongly radial orbital
distributions are inconsistent with the observed kinematics of the M87 GCS. The
evolution of models with a bell-shaped GCMF with a turnover similar to that
currently observed in old GCS is also investigated. We show that models with
this initial GCMF can satisfy all the observational constraints currently
available on the GCS spatial distribution,the GCS velocity distribution and on
the GCMF properties.In particular these models successfully reproduce both the
lack of a radial gradient of the GCS mean mass recently found in an analysis of
HST images of M87 at multiple locations, and the observed kinematics of the M87
GCS.Our simulations also show that evolutionary processes significantly affect
the initial GCS properties by leading to the disruption of many clusters and
changing the masses of those which survive.The preferential disruption of inner
clusters flattens the initial GCS number density profile and it can explain the
rising specific frequency with radius; we show that the inner flattening
observed in the M87 GCS spatial distribution can be the result of the effects
of dynamical evolution on an initially steep density profile. (abridged)

these models are in agreement with the current gravitationally lensed quasar

observed; Mass-Luminosity relations (ML) obtained from evolutionary tracks
disagree with Mass-Luminosity relations derived from observations. We find that
the above failures concern models built with standard input physics as well as
with non-standard ones. The present work suggests that towards highest
magnitudes, Cepheids stars undergo a selection effect caused by evolution: only
the most metal poor stars cross the Instability Strip during the ``blue loop''
phase and are therefore the only ones which can be observed at low luminosity.
This solution enables us to reproduce the shape of the lower part of the

structures represent ~ 4-5 sigma peaks in the primordial density field and
their expected number is low (~10^-2 - 10^-4). Fortunately, there are several
plausible explanations (many of which are testable) for these low probabilities

events -- without requiring electron-electron interactions. The degree of
entanglement (concurrence) equals 2(T_1 T_2)^1/2 (T_1+T_2)^-1, with T_1,T_2 <<

fixed and fluctuating charge systems; using a canonical ensemble to describe
the former and a grand canonical ensemble to study the latter. Our novel
approach is based on the philosophy that the black hole quantum spectrum is an
essential component in any such calculation. For definiteness, we employ a
uniformly spaced area spectrum, which has been advocated by Bekenstein and
others in the literature. The generic results are applied to some specific
models; in particular, various limiting cases of an (arbitrary-dimensional)
AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. We find that the leading-order quantum
correction to the entropy can consistently be expressed as the logarithm of the
classical quantity. For a small AdS curvature parameter and zero net charge, it
is shown that, independent of the dimension, the logarithmic prefactor is +1/2
when the charge is fixed but +1 when the charge is fluctuating.We also
demonstrate that, in the grand canonical framework, the fluctuations in the
charge are large, $\Delta Q\sim\Delta A\sim S_{BH}^{1/2}$, even when $<Q> =0$.
A further implication of this framework is that an asymptotically flat,
non-extremal black hole can never achieve a state of thermal equilibrium.

some examples of how these tests can be quite effective in revealing various

black holes and neutron stars) in general relativity is the instantaneously
circular orbit assumption. This approximation has been used extensively, from
the calculation of innermost circular orbits to the construction of initial
data for numerical relativity calculations. While this assumption is
inconsistent with generic general relativistic astrophysical inspiral phenomena
where the dissipative effects of gravitational radiation cause the separation
of the compact objects to decrease in time, it is usually argued that the
timescale of this dissipation is much longer than the orbital timescale so that
the approximation of circular orbits is valid. Here, we quantitatively analyze
this approximation using a post-Newtonian approach that includes terms up to
order ({Gm/(rc^2)})^{9/2} for non-spinning particles. By calculating the
evolution of equal mass black hole / black hole binary systems starting with
circular orbit configurations and comparing them to the more astrophysically
relevant quasicircular solutions, we show that a minimum initial separation
corresponding to at least 6 (3.5) orbits before plunge is required in order to
bound the detection event loss rate in gravitational wave detectors to < 5%
(20%). In addition, we show that the detection event loss rate is > 95% for a
range of initial separations that include all modern calculations of the
innermost circular orbit (ICO).

obtained theoretical entropy per particle of the virialized halos with an
empirical entropy per particle given in terms of dynamical halo variables of
actual galactic structures. We apply this criterion to the cases when
neutralinos are mostly B-inos and mostly Higgsinos, in conjunction with the
usual ``abundance'' criterion requiring that present neutralino relic density
complies with $0.2<\Omega_{{\tilde\chi^1_0}} < 0.4$ for $h\simeq 0.65$. The
joint application of both criteria reveals that a much better fitting occurs

favored channel along the mass range of $150 \hbox{GeV} < m_{{\tilde\chi^1_0}}

patterns that emerge from recent theoretical analysis on cosmic ray positron

other particle candidates of thermal WIMP gas relics.

$\mu_\nu B_0= (10^{-12}\mu_B)(10^{10} G)$, where $B_0$ is the strength of the
magnetic field at the surface of the iron core. In particular for the model
with zero metallicity, the conversion is highly nonadiabatic in the high energy
region, reflecting the $(1-2Y_e)$ profile of the model. In calculating the
flavor conversion, we find that the shock wave propagation, which changes
density profiles drastically, is a much more severe problem than it is for the
pure Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) conversion case. This is because the
RSF effect occurs at a far deeper region than the MSW effect. To avoid the
uncertainty concerning the shock propagation, we restrict our discussion to 0.5
s after the core bounce (and for more conservative discussion, 0.25 s), during
which the shock wave is not expected to affect the RSF region. We also evaluate
the energy spectrum at the Super-Kamiokande detector for various models using
the calculated conversion probabilities, and find that it is very difficult to
obtain useful information on the supernova metallicities and magnetic fields or
on the neutrino magnetic moment from the supernova neutrino observation. Future
prospects are also discussed.

of this thesis is to use a symmetry of the decoherence mechanism to find robust
encodings of the quantum information. Stability, control, and methods for using
decoherence-free information in a quantum computer are presented with a
specific emphasis on decoherence due to a collective coupling between the
system and its environment. Universal quantum computation on such collective
decoherence decoherence-free encodings is demonstrated. Rigorous definitions of
control and the use of encoded universality in quantum computers are addressed.
Explicit gate constructions for encoded universality on ion trap and exchange
based quantum computers are given. In the second part of the thesis we examine
physical systems with error correcting properties. We examine systems that can
store quantum information in their ground state such that decoherence processes
are prohibited via energetics. We present the theory of supercoherent systems
whose ground states are quantum error detecting codes and describe a spin
ladder whose ground state has both the error detecting and correcting
properties. We conclude by discussing naturally fault-tolerant quantum
computation.

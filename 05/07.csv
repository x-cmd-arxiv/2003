evolution of a spatially homogeneous ultra-light scalar field ($m \sim H_0$)
during the matter and $\Lambda$ dominated eras is analyzed. Agreement of
$\Delta \alpha/\alpha$ with the value suggested by recent observations of
quasar absorption lines is obtained by adjusting a single parameter, the
coupling of the scalar field to matter.
  Asymptotically $\alpha(t)$ in this model goes to a constant value
$\bar{\alpha} \approx \alpha_0$ in the early radiation and the late $\Lambda$
dominated eras. The coupling of the scalar field to (nonrelativistic) matter
drives $\alpha$ slightly away from $\bar{\alpha}$ in the epochs when the
density of matter is important.
  Simultaneous agreement with the more restrictive bounds on the variation
$|\Delta \alpha/\alpha|$ from the Oklo natural fission reactor and from
meteorite samples can be achieved if the mass of the scalar field is on the
order of 0.5--0.6 $H_\Lambda$, where $H_\Lambda = \Omega_\Lambda^{1/2} H_0$.
  Depending on the scalar field mass, $\alpha$ may be slightly smaller or
larger than $\alpha_0$ at the times of big bang nucleosynthesis, the emission
of the cosmic microwave background, the formation of early solar system
meteorites, and the Oklo reactor. The effects on the evolution of $\alpha$ due
to nonzero mass for the scalar field are emphasized.
  An order of magnitude improvement in the laboratory technique could lead to a
detection of $(\dot{\alpha}/\alpha)_0$.

follow the fragmentation of a turbulent molecular cloud and the subsequent
formation and early evolution of a stellar cluster containing more than 400
stars. We show that the stellar cluster forms through the hierarchical
fragmentation of a turbulent molecular cloud. This leads to the formation of
many small subclusters which interact and merge to form the final stellar
cluster. The hierarchical nature of the cluster formation has serious
implications in terms of the properties of the new-born stars. The higher
number-density of stars in subclusters, compared to a more uniform distribution
arising from a monolithic formation, results in closer and more frequent
dynamical interactions. Such close interactions can truncate circumstellar
discs, harden existing binaries, and potentially liberate a population of
planets. We estimate that at least one-third of all stars, and most massive
stars, suffer such disruptive interactions.

the early stages of the evolution of active galaxies. To test this suggestion,
the ratios of the central massive black hole (MBH) mass to the bulge mass

It is found that NL AGNs appear to have genuinely lower MBH/Bulge mass ratio
($M_{\rm bh}/M_{\rm bulge}$). The mean $ log(M_{\rm bh}/M_{\rm bulge})$ for 22
NL AGNs is $-3.9\pm 0.07$, which is an order of magnitude lower than that for
Broad Line AGNs and quiescent galaxies. We suggest a nonlinear MBH/Bulge
relation and find there exists a relation between the $M_{\rm bh}/M_{\rm

interpretations of the nonlinear MBH/Bulge relation. The MBH growth timescales

check of the model. We cross-correlate the NRAO VLA Sky Survey radio source

polarized than the broad lines and continuum for all polarized objects. These
properties favor scattering by material close to a partially obscured and
reddened active nucleus, but exterior to the regions producing the broad-line
emission, as the source of polarized flux in 2MASS QSOs. The largely
unpolarized narrow-line features require that the electrons or dust polarizing
the light be located at distances from the nucleus not much greater than the

  March 15th-22nd 2003",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We analyse the curvaton scenario in the context of supersymmetry.
Supersymmetric theories contain many scalars, and therefore many curvaton
candidates. To obtain a scale invariant perturbation spectrum, the curvaton
mass should be small during inflation $m \ll H$. This can be achieved by
invoking symmetries, which suppress the soft masses and non-renormalizable
terms in the potential. Other model-independent constraints on the curvaton
model come from nucleosynthesis, gravitino overproduction, and thermal damping.
The curvaton can work for masses $m \gtrsim 10^4 \GeV$, and very small
couplings (e.g. $h \lesssim 10^{-6}$ for $m \lesssim 10^8 \GeV$).

analysed using the high-resolution cameras and spectrometers on board

plasma components of kT = 0.3 and 0.8 keV. The abundance value from this shell
is consistent with the average LMC values. More extreme temperature variations
are possibly indicated by spatial variations in the O VII forbidden/resonance
line ratio, which could imply that in some regions the plasma is cooling
dramatically and recombining. However, an alternative and equally interesting
possibility is that the variation in forbidden/resonance ratios is due to
resonant scattering, which would reduce resonance line emission along lines of
sight with a high O VII column density. The inner region is hotter (kT = 1.1
keV) and shows enhanced Fe and Si abundances. We estimate the Fe and Si ejecta
mass to be 0.7-1.1 M_sun and 0.1--0.15 M_sun, respectively. The morphology,
mass estimates and abundances strongly suggest that DEM L 71 is the result of a
type Ia explosion, as indicated by previous measurements.

structure of the gas in the atmosphere of the Virgo cluster around M87. We
construct a simple model for the temperature and density distribution. This
model implies that the cumulative mass of the cluster gas is a power-law of its
entropy index, $kT n^{-2/3}$, similar to the Hydra cluster. This supports the
idea that such power-laws are a direct consequence of gas cooling in a
gravitational potential. In the cluster atmosphere hot bubbles of gas injected
by the AGN are rising buoyantly. We estimate the age of these structures from
the synchrotron radio data and find that this `radiative age' is consistent
with the estimated dynamical timescale. However, this requires a spatial
separation of the relativistic particles from the magnetic field. The age
estimates suggest an activity cycle of the AGN in M87 of roughly $10^8$ years.
We show that the largest radio structures are consistent with being the
remnants of buoyant bubbles injected by the AGN during an even earlier activity
cycle. The wakes behind the currently rising hot bubbles uplift cold gas from
the cluster centre. Using a simple model for the trajectory of the cold gas, we
demonstrate that the observations by XMM-Newton of a mix of hot and cold gas in
the cluster atmosphere in the vicinity of the radio structure can be explained
in this scenario. This may also explain the ridges of enhanced X-ray emission
from cold gas observed with CHANDRA.

treatment, whose key ingredient is an integral equation yielding the

inconsistencies, misses the existence of a nontrivial anisotropy exponent
$\theta\ne 1/2$, and therefore yields incorrect hyperscaling relations. His
$\epsilon$-expansion results to order $\epsilon^2$ for the critical exponents
of $m$-axial Lifshitz points are incorrect both in the anisotropic ($0<m<d$)
and the isotropic cases ($m=d$). The inherent inconsistencies and the lack of a
sound basis of the approach makes its results unacceptable even if they are
interpreted in the sense of approximations.

non-ideal Bose gas approximation (WBGA), is applied in the analysis of of the
three reaction-diffusion models (i) A+A->0, (ii) A+B->0 and (iii)
A+A,B+B,A+B->0 (the ABBA model). The two types of WBGA are considered, the
simpler WBGA-I and more complicated WBGA-II. All models are defined on the
lattice to facilitate comparison with computer experiment (simulation). It is
found that the WBGA describes A+B reaction well, it reproduces correct d/4
density decay exponent. However, it fails in the case of the A+A reaction and
the ABBA model. (To cure deficiency of WBGA in dealing with A+A model the
hybrid of WBGA and Kirkwood superposition approximation is suggested.) It is
shown that the WBGA-I is identical to the dressed tree calculation suggested by
Lee in J. Phys. A 27, 2633 (1994), and that the dressed tree calculation does
not lead to the d/2 density decay exponent when applied to the A+A reaction, as
normally believed, but it predicts d/4 decay exponent. Last, the usage of the
small n_0 approximation suggested by Mattis and Glasser in Rev. Mod. Phys. 70,

pairing phenomenon have different Fermi surfaces with a large enough
separation. In these conditions it could be more favorable for each of the
pairing fermions to stay close to its Fermi surface and, differently from the
usual BCS state, for the Cooper pair to have a non zero total momentum. For
this reason in this state the gap varies in space, the ground state is
inhomogeneous and a crystalline structure might be formed. This situation was
considered for the first time by Fulde, Ferrell, Larkin and Ovchinnikov, and
the corresponding state is called LOFF. The spontaneous breaking of the space
symmetries in the vacuum state is a characteristic feature of this phase and is
associated to the presence of long wave-length excitations of zero mass. The
situation described here is of interest both in solid state and in elementary
particle physics, in particular in Quantum Chromo-Dynamics at high density and
small temperature. In this review we present the theoretical approach to the
LOFF state and its phenomenological applications using the language of the

achieved for $GL_{q}(n),SO_{q}(2n+1),SO_{q}(2n),Sp_{q}(2n)$ for all $n$ and
also for various other interesting cases including the 8-vertex matrix.We
explain how the limits $\theta \to \pm \infty$ can be interpreted to provide
factorizations of the standard (non-Baxterized) braid matrices. A systematic
approach to diagonalization of projectors and hence of braid matrices is
presented with explicit constructions for

diagonalization is obtained for all dimensions. In each factor $F(\theta)$ our
diagonalization again factors out all dependence on the spectral parameter
$\theta$ as a diagonal matrix. The canonical property implemented in the
diagonalizers is mutual orthogonality of the rows. Applications of our

in elementary and in heavy ion reactions. The production of vector mesons
($\rho,\omega$) is described via the excitation of nuclear resonances ($R$).
The theoretical framework is an extended vector meson dominance model (eVMD).
The treatment of the resonance decays $R\longmapsto NV$ with arbitrary spin is
covariant and kinematically complete. The eVMD includes thereby excited vector
meson states in the transition form factors. This ensures correct asymptotics
and provides a unified description of photonic and mesonic decays. The
resonance model is successfully applied to the $\omega$ production in $p+p$
reactions. The same model is applied to the dilepton production in elementary
reactions ($p+p, p+d$). Corresponding data are well reproduced. However, when
the model is applied to heavy ion reactions in the BEVALAC/SIS energy range the
experimental dilepton spectra measured by the DLS Collaboration are
significantly underestimated at small invariant masses. As a possible solution
of this problem the destruction of quantum interference in a dense medium is
discussed. A decoherent emission through vector mesons decays enhances the
corresponding dilepton yield in heavy ion reactions. In the vicinity of the
$\rho/\omega$-peak the reproduction of the data requires further a substantial
collisional broadening of the $\rho$ and in particular of the $\omega$ meson.

isospin differs from the initial isospin versus cases where the two isospins
are the same. For $N=Z$ even-even nuclei with $J^{\pi}=0^+, T=0$ ground states
such as $^8Be$ and $^{20}Ne$, the summed $T=0 \to T=1$ IOMD from the ground
state to all the $J=1, T=1$ states in the $0 \hbar \omega$ space does not
vanish when the $Q \cdot Q$ interaction is turned off. The pairing interaction
(ICP) alone leads to a finite transition rate. For nuclei with $J=0^+, T=1$
ground states such as $^{10}Be$ and $^{22}Ne$, the summed $T=1 \to T=1$ IOMD
$does$ vanish when the $Q \cdot Q$ interaction is turned off, as is expected in

corresponding sum of the $T=1 \to T=2$ IOMD transitions. In $^{22}Ne$ (but not
in $^{10}Be$) the sum of the $T=1 \to T=2$ IOMD transitions is remarkably
insensitive to the strengths of both the $Q \cdot Q$ and the ICP interactions.

Plasma waves and their associated instabilities (e.g., the Buneman instability,
two-streaming instability, and the Weibel instability) created in the shocks
are responsible for particle (electron, positron, and ion) acceleration. Using
a 3-D relativistic electromagnetic particle (REMP) code, we have investigated
particle acceleration associated with a relativistic jet front propagating
through an ambient plasma with and without initial magnetic fields. We find
only small differences in the results between no ambient and weak ambient
magnetic fields. Simulations show that the Weibel instability created in the
collisionless shock front accelerates particles perpendicular and parallel to
the jet propagation direction. While some Fermi acceleration may occur at the
jet front, the majority of electron acceleration takes place behind the jet
front and cannot be characterized as Fermi acceleration. The simulation results
show that this instability is responsible for generating and amplifying highly
nonuniform, small-scale magnetic fields, which contribute to the electron's
transverse deflection behind the jet head. The ``jitter'' radiation (Medvedev
2000) from deflected electrons has different properties than synchrotron
radiation which is calculated in a uniform magnetic field. This jitter
radiation may be important to understanding the complex time evolution and/or
spectral structure in gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jets, and supernova
remnants.

number of objects in uniform optically-identified samples, especially when rare
subclasses are considered, or subsets isolated to search for evolution or
correlations between wavebands. We describe initial results of a program aimed
to ultimately yield 10^4 X-ray source identifications--a sample about an order
of magnitude larger than earlier efforts. The technique employs X-ray data from
the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), and optical imaging and spectroscopic followup
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Optical objects in the SDSS catalogs
are automatically cross-correlated with RASS X-ray source positions; then
priorities for follow-on SDSS optical spectra of candidate counterparts are
automatically assigned using an algorithm based on the known fx/fopt ratios for
various classes of X-ray emitters. SDSS parameters for optical morphology,
magnitude, colors, plus FIRST radio data, serve as proxies for object class.
  Initial application of this approach to 1400 deg^2 of sky provides a catalog
of 1200 spectroscopically confirmed quasars/AGN that are probable RASS
identifications. Most of the IDs are new, and only a few percent of the AGN are
likely to be random superpositions. The magnitude and redshift ranges of the
counterparts extend over 15<m<21 and 0.03<z<3.6. Although most IDs are quasars
and Sy 1s, a variety of other AGN subclasses are also sampled. Substantial
numbers of rare AGN are found, including more than 130 narrow-line Seyfert 1s
and 45 BL Lac candidates. These results already provide a sizeable set of new
IDs, show utility of the sample in multi-waveband studies, and demonstrate the
capability of the RASS/SDSS approach to efficiently proceed towards the largest
homogeneously selected/observed sample of X-ray emitting AGN. Abridged Abstract

2.48 years (906 days) and a semi-amplitude of 27.5 m s$^{-1}$. We performed a
careful analysis of our Ca II H & K S-index measurements, spectral line
bisectors, and {\it Hipparcos} photometry. We found no significant variations
in these quantities with the 906-d period. We also re-analyzed the Ca II

periodic variations with the ``planet'' period when first published. This
analysis shows that periodic Ca II equivalent width variations were only
present during 1986.5 -- 1992 and absent during 1981--1986.5. Furthermore, a
refined period for the Ca II $\lambda$8662 {\AA} variations is 2.14 yrs,
significantly less than residual radial velocity period. The most likely
explanation of the residual radial velocity variations is a planetary mass
companion with $M$ sin $i$ = 1.7 $M_{Jupiter}$ and an orbital semi-major axis

clusters studied in the Hubble Key Project may contain quantized intrinsic
redshift components that are related to those reported by Tifft. Here we report
the results of a similar analysis using 55 spiral (Sc and Sb) galaxies, and 36
Type Ia supernovae (SnIa) galaxies. We find that even when many more objects
are included in the sample there is still clear evidence that the same
quantized intrinsic redshifts are present and superimposed on the Hubble flow.
We find Hubble constants of Ho = 60.0 and 57.5 km s^(-1) Mpc^(-1) for the Sc
and Sb galaxies respectively. For the SnIa galaxies we find Ho = 58. These
values are considerably lower than the value of Ho = 72 reported by the Hubble
Key Project, but are good in agreement with the value Ho = 60 found for
intermediate redshifts using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. Evidence is
also presented that suggests that the presence of unaccounted for intrinsic
redshifts may have led us incorrectly to the conclusion that a ""great

wavelength of fluctuations of interest and H^{-1} is the horizon at the end of

not drop faster than radiation subsequent to inflation. This limit implies that
the amount of expansion between the time the scales of interest leave the
horizon and the end of inflation, denoted by e^N, is also bounded from above,
by about e^60 times a factor that involves an integral over the first slow-roll
parameter. In other words, the bound on N is model dependent -- we show that
for vast classes of slow-roll models, N < 67. The quantities, \lambda / H^{-1}
or N, play an important role in determining the nature of inflationary scalar
and tensor fluctuations. We suggest ways to incorporate the above bounds when
confronting inflation models with observations. As an example, this bound
solidifies the tension between observations of cosmic microwave background

Uses emulateapj.cls (included)","Astrophys.J. 590 (2003) L83-L86","10.1086/376721",,"astro-ph",,"  We explore the idea that the observed variations in the peak luminosities of
Type Ia supernovae originate in part from a scatter in metallicity of the
main-sequence stars that become white dwarfs. Previous, numerical, studies have
not self-consistently explored metallicities greater than solar.
One-dimensional Chandrasekhar mass models of SNe Ia produce most of their 56Ni
in a burn to nuclear statistical equilibrium between the mass shells 0.2 and
0.8 solar masses, for which the electron to nucleon ratio is constant during
the burn. We show analytically that, under these conditions, charge and mass
conservation constrain the mass of 56Ni produced to depend linearly on the
original metallicity of the white dwarf progenitor. Detailed post-processing of
W7-like models confirms this linear dependence. The effect that we identify is
most evident at metallicities larger than solar, and is in agreement with
previous self-consistent calculations over the metallicity range common to both
calculations. The observed scatter in the metallicity (1/3--3 times solar) of
the solar neighborhood is enough to induce a 25% variation in the mass of 56Ni
ejected by Type Ia supernovae. This is sufficient to vary the peak V-band
brightness by approximately 0.2. This scatter in metallicity is present out to
the limiting redshifts of current observations (z < 1). Sedimentation of 22Ne
can possibly amplify the variation in 56Ni mass up to 50%. Further numerical
studies can determine if other metallicity-induced effects, such as a change in
the mass of the 56Ni-producing region, offset or enhance this variation.

completely suggesting that the gas is located outside the BLR. On the contrary
the system at z(abs)= 4.685 has a covering factor of ~0.9. The observed H I
absorption line together with the limits on C II and Si II absorptions suggest
that 16<log N(H I) (cm^{-2})<~17 in z(abs) = 4.855 absorption system.
Comparison with models show that the observed column densities of N V, Si IV
and C IV in this system require that N is underabundant by more than a factor 3
compared to Si if the ionizing radiation is similar to a typical QSO spectrum.
This is contrary to what is usually derived for the emission line gas in QSOs.
We show that the relative suppression in the N V column density can be
explained for Solar abundance ratios or abundance ratios typical of Starburst
abundances if an ionizing spectrum devoid of X-rays is used instead. Thus, if
the composition of BAL is like that of BLR then it is most likely that the
cloud sees a spectrum devoid of X-rays similar to what we observe from this
QSO. This is consistent with the fact that none of our models have high Compton
optical depth to remove X-rays from the QSO. Similar arguments lead to the
conclusion that the system at z(abs)= 4.685 as well is not Compton thick. The
estimated black hole mass is 8 10^8 solar mass suggesting the accretion onto

Results of the optical analysis are consistent with previous measurements. The
amplitude of optical emission line variability is a factor of two larger than
that of the underlying optical continuum, but part or all of the difference can
be due to host-galaxy starlight contamination or due to the lines being driven
by the unseen UV continuum, which is more variable than the optical continuum.
We measured the lag between optical lines and continuum and found a lower, more
accurate broad line region size of 3.0+-1.5 light days in this object. The
implied black hole mass is M_BH=5(+6,-3)x10^5 M_sun; this is the lowest mass
found, so far, for an active nucleus. We find significant evidence for an
X-ray-optical (XO) correlation with a peak lag of about <1 day, although the
centroid of the asymmetric correlation function reveals that part of the
optical flux varies in advance of the X-ray flux by 2.4+-1.0 days. This complex
XO correlation is explained as a possible combination of X-ray reprocessing and
perturbations propagating from the outer (optically emitting) parts of the

$\rho_{ab}(T)$ observed in untwinned and twinned YBCO crystals, respectively.

transformation of $\rho_{ab}(T)$ from a non-linear dependence towards a more
linear one (less flattening). In films with 7- $\delta = 6.90$ the increase of

demonstrates that CuO_2 planes indeed contain anti-phase AF domain boundaries
in which charges are confined, forming anti-phase stripes. The data suggest
that a high magnetic field turns the anti-phase stripes into in-phase stripes,

challenges the notion that the anti-phase character of stripes facilitates

play a crucial role in determining the remarkable accuracy of the many-body
state: the former permits the correct treatment of the nondynamic correlation
effects, the latter allows the wavefunction to fulfill the cusp conditions and
makes the geminal expansion rapidly converging to the lowest possible
variational energies. This ansatz is expected to provide a substantial part of
the correlation energy for general complex atomic and molecular systems. The
antisymmetric geminal term can be written as a single determinant even in the
polarized cases. In general, therefore, the computational effort to sample this
correlated wavefunction is not very demanding. We applied this Jastrow-geminal
approach to atoms up to Z=15, always getting good variational energies, by
particularly improving those with a strong multiconfigurational nature. Our

spacetimes in which the total duration of inflation is finite. This conclusion
holds despite the absence of any trans-Planckian effects or effective field

find that the uncertainty is generically small. This uncertainty should be

produced perturbatively and then the pair is transformed into the baryon. The
transformation is nonperturbative. Since a heavy quark moves with a small
velocity in the baryon in its rest frame, we can use NRQCD to describe the

can explain the experimental data in the scalar pi pi scattering channel of QCD
up to about 800 MeV. Since it is just a scaled version of the minimal
electroweak Higgs sector, which is often treated with the same unitarization
method, we interpret the result as support for this approach in the electroweak
model with scaled values of tree level Higgs mass up to at least about 2 TeV.
We further note that the relevant QCD effective Lagrangian which fits the data
to still higher energies using the same method involves another scalar
resonance. This suggests that the method should also be applicable to
corresponding beyond minimal electroweak models. Nevertheless we note that even
with one resonance, the minimal K matrix unitarized model behaves smoothly for
large bare Higgs mass by effectively ""integrating out"" the Higgs while
preserving unitarity. With added confidence in this simple approach we make a
survey of the Higgs sector for the full range of bare Higgs mass. One amusing
point which emerges is that the characteristic factor of the W-W fusion
mechanism for Higgs production peaks at the bare mass of the Higgs boson, while
the characteristic factor for the gluon fusion mechanism peaks near the
generally lower physical mass.

  A formula is derived for the scalar curvature and Ricci curvature of a
G_2-structure in terms of its torsion. When the fundamental 3-form of the
G_2-structure is closed, this formula implies, in particular, that the scalar
curvature of the underlying metric is nonpositive and vanishes if and only if
the structure is torsion-free. This version contains some new results on the
pinching of Ricci curvature for metrics associated to closed G_2-structures.
  Some formulae are derived for closed solutions of the Laplacian flow that
specify how various related quantities, such as the torsion and the metric,
evolve with the flow. These may be useful in studying convergence or long-time
existence for given initial data.

investigating the permitted variation of fundamental constants during the
earliest epochs of the Universe. Here we present a BBN calculation that has
been modified to permit changes in the QCD scale, Lambda_QCD. The primary
effects of changing the QCD scale upon BBN are through the deuteron binding
energy, B_D, and the neutron-proton mass difference, delta-m_np, which both
play crucial roles in determining the primordial abundances. In this paper, we
show how a simplified BBN calculation allows us to restrict the nuclear data we
need to just B_D and delta-m_np yet still gives useful results so that any
variation in Lambda_QCD may be constrained via the corresponding shifts in B_D
and delta-m_np by using the current estimates of the primordial deuterium
abundance and helium mass fraction. The simplification predicts the helium-4
and deuterium abundances to within 1% and 50% respectively when compared with
the results of a standard BBN code. But Lambda_QCD also affects much of
remaining required nuclear input so this method introduces a systematic error
into the calculation and we find a degeneracy between B_D and delta-m_np. We
show how increased understanding of the relationship of the pion mass and/or
B_D to other nuclear parameters, such as the binding energy of tritium and the
cross section of T + D -> He4 + n, would yield constraints upon any change in
B_D and delta-m_np at the 10% level.

? Is it scalar or vector ? Apparently it appears that mass is scalar; but
relativistic mass is velocity dependent and moving mass such as photon is
vector boson. In the present paper a new concept is introduced that in general,
mass is neither scalar nor vector rather, mass is a quaternion quantity (scalar
+ vector). The concept of quaternion mass suggests that the total mass M of a
moving body is quaternion sum of : (i) the scalar(grain or rest mass) mass mg
establishing its particle behavior and (ii) the vector(photonic) mass mp
governing its wave properties. Mathematically, total quaternion mass as M = mg
+ mp, its magnitude being the Pythagorean sum as |M| = (mg2+mp2)1/2 . The
theory proposed here explains the wave-particle duality more clearly &
conceptually and gives a mathematical blend to de-Broglie hypothesis. It also
explains successfully several effects such as Compton effect and refraction of
light which could not be explained otherwise by a single theory of wave or
particle. Also explained are: Doppler effect of light, Photo-electric effect,
Uncertainty principle and Relativity. The quaternion mass concept proposed in
this paper is novel & is of fundamental importance; this could prove to be a

assumed to be ideal and incompressible, waves are potential, two-dimensional,
and symmetric, the authors have recently reported the existence of a new type
of gravity waves on deep water besides well studied Stokes waves (Phys. Rev.
Lett., 2002, v. 89, 164502). The distinctive feature of these waves is that
horizontal water velocities in the wave crests exceed the speed of the crests
themselves. Such waves were found to describe irregular flows with stagnation
point inside the flow domain and discontinuous streamlines near the wave
crests. Irregular flows produce a simple model for describing the initial stage
of the formation of spilling breakers when a localized jet is formed at the
crest following by generating whitecaps.
  In the present work, a new highly efficient method for computing steady
potential gravity waves on deep water is proposed to examine the above results
in more detail. The method is based on the truncated fractional approximations
for the velocity potential in terms of the basis functions
$1/\bigr(1-\exp(y_0-y-ix)\bigl)^n$, $y_0$ being a free parameter. The
non-linear transformation of the horizontal scale $x = \chi - \gamma \sin\chi,
0<\gamma<1,$ is additionally applied to concentrate a numerical emphasis on the
crest region of a wave for accelerating the convergence of the series.
Fractional approximations were employed for calculating both steep Stokes waves
and irregular flows. For lesser computational time, the advantage in accuracy
over ordinary Fourier expansions in terms the basis functions $\exp\bigl(n
(y+ix)\bigr)$ was found to be from one to ten decimal orders depending on the
wave steepness and flow parameters.

We observe, for high concentrations, the existence of an interval of external

border zone"" identified in the response of Superheated Superconducting Granule
detectors. We explain such behaviour as produced by a geometrical ordering
dynamically induced in the system by transitions in preferential sites due to
diamagnetic interactions.

needed for performing practical quantum computing can degrade the performance
of quantum computers. During these delays, unwanted relative dynamical phases
are produced due to the free evolution of the superposition wave-function of
the qubits. In general, these coherent ""errors"" modify the desired quantum
interferences and thus spoil the correct results, compared to the ideal
standard quantum computing that does not consider the effects of delays between
successive unitary operations. Here, we show that, in the framework of the
quantum phase estimation algorithm, these coherent phase ""errors"", produced by
the time delays between sequential operations, can be avoided by setting up the

continuously by a sequence of unitary transformations. However, there always
exist idle finite time intervals between consecutive operations in a realistic
quantum computing process. During these delays, coherent ""errors"" will
accumulate from the dynamical phases of the superposed wave functions. Here we
explore the sensitivity of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm to such errors.
Our results clearly show a severe sensitivity of Shor's factorization algorithm
to the presence of delay times between successive unitary transformations.
Specifically, in the presence of these {\it coherent ""errors""}, the probability
of obtaining the correct answer decreases exponentially with the number of
qubits of the work register. A particularly simple phase-matching approach is
proposed in this paper to {\it avoid} or suppress these {\it coherent errors}
when using Shor's algorithm to factorize integers. The robustness of this
phase-matching condition is evaluated analytically or numerically for the
factorization of several integers: $4, 15, 21$, and 33.

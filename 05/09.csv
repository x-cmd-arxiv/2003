neglects two physical agents in the problem that are important at radii
R<10^{17} cm: a radiative precursor (the prompt GRB) and a relativistic front
of free neutrons. The radiative precursor preaccelerates the medium and loads
it with e+- pairs. This provides a new explanation for the early optical
flashes in GRBs. The front of free neutrons must form in a standard baryonic
fireball and change the mechanism of the fireball deceleration. The neutron
effect, however, disappears if the fireball is strongly dominated by the
Poynting flux. The neutrons thus provide a unique link between the progenitor

an unusual hardening of the 2-10 keV X-ray spectrum which lasted several
months. The spectral hardening was not accompanied by any correlated variation

absorption by a gas cloud of column density 2.6 10^23 cm^-2 crossing the line
of sight to the X-ray source. A spectrum obtained by XMM-Newton during an early

the absorbing cloud is only weakly ionised. The XMM-Newton spectrum also shows
that ~10% of the X-ray flux is not obscured, but this unabsorbed component is
not significantly variable and may be scattered radiation from a large-scale
scattering medium. Applying the spectral constraints on cloud ionisation
parameter and assuming that the cloud follows a Keplerian orbit, we constrain
the location of the cloud to be R~10-100 light-days from the central X-ray

cosmological phase transition during the radiation dominated era. The setting
is a theory of N charged scalar fields coupled to an abelian gauge field, that
undergoes a phase transition at a critical temperature much larger than the
electroweak scale. The dynamics after the transition features two distinct
stages: a spinodal regime dominated by linear long-wavelength instabilities,
and a scaling stage in which the non-linearities and backreaction of the scalar
fields are dominant.This second stage describes the growth of horizon sized
domains.We implement a formulation based on the non-equilibrium Schwinger-Dyson
equations to obtain the spectrum of magnetic fields that includes the
dissipative effects of the plasma. We find that large scale magnetogenesis is
efficient during the scaling regime.Charged scalar field fluctuations with
wavelengths of the order of the Hubble radius induce large scale magnetogenesis
via loop effects. The leading processes are: pair production, pair annihilation
and low energy bremsstrahlung, these processes while forbidden in equilibrium
are allowed strongly out of equilibrium.The ratio between the energy density on
scales larger than L and that in the background radiation r(L,T)= rho_B(L,T)/
rho_{cmb}(T) is r(L,T) sim 10^{-34} at the Electroweak scale and r(L,T) sim
10^{-14} at the QCD scale for L sim 1 Mpc.The resulting spectrum is insensitive
to the magnetic diffusion length and equipartition between electric and
magnetic fields does not hold. We conjecture that a similar mechanism could be
operative after the QCD chiral phase transition.

anisotropic particle heating. Measurements made by UVCS/SOHO have revived
interest in the idea that ions are energized by the dissipation of ion
cyclotron resonant waves, but such high-frequency (i.e., small wavelength)
fluctuations have not been observed. A turbulent cascade is one possible way of
generating small-scale fluctuations from a pre-existing population of
low-frequency MHD waves. We model this cascade as a combination of advection
and diffusion in wavenumber space. The dominant spectral transfer occurs in the
direction perpendicular to the background magnetic field. As expected from
earlier models, this leads to a highly anisotropic fluctuation spectrum with a
rapidly decaying tail in parallel wavenumber. The wave power that decays to
high enough frequencies to become ion cyclotron resonant depends on the
relative strengths of advection and diffusion in the cascade. For the most
realistic values of these parameters, though, there is insufficient power to
heat protons and heavy ions. The dominant oblique fluctuations (with dispersion
properties of kinetic Alfven waves) undergo Landau damping, which implies
strong parallel electron heating. We discuss the probable nonlinear evolution
of the electron velocity distributions into parallel beams and discrete
phase-space holes (similar to those seen in the terrestrial magnetosphere)
which can possibly heat protons via stochastic interactions.

requires the inner engine to produce a jet with a different opening angle each
explosion, while the latter requires a standard engine. The physical structure
of the jet is a crucial factor in understanding GRB progenitors, and therefore
discriminating the two jet scenarios is particularly relevant. In the
structured jet case, specific predictions can be made for the distribution of
observed break angles $\theta_{\rm break}$, while that distribution is
arbitrary in the first scenario. We derive the theoretical distribution for the

0.5 dex, using the atomic lines of KI and NaI. This result points toward the
development of photometric spectral indices to separate low-mass members from
foreground and background objects in young clusters and associations. We also

galaxy in the M 81 triplet, resolve the X-ray emission from several
supershells. The emission is brightest in the cavities defined by expanding
shells detected previously in H alpha emission (Martin 1998). Thermal emission
models fitted to the data imply temperatures ranging from ~1.3 to 4.9 x 10^(6)
K and indicate that the strongest absorption is coincident with the densest
clouds traced by CO emission. The fitted emission measures give pressures of
P/k~10^(5-6) xi^(-0.5) f_(v)^(-0.5) K cm^(-3) (xi: metallicity of the hot gas
in solar units, f_(v): volume filling factor). Despite these high pressures,
the radial density profile of the hot gas is not as steep as that expected in a
freely expanding wind (e.g., as seen in the neighboring starburst galaxy M 82)
implying that the hot gas is still confined by the H alpha shells. The chaotic
dynamical state of NGC 3077 undermines reliable estimates of the escape
velocity. The more relevant quantity for the ultimate fate of the outflow is
probably the gas density in the rich intragroup medium. Based on the HI
distribution of NGC 3077 and a connected tidal tail we argue that the wind has
the potential to leave the gravitational well of NGC 3077 to the north but not
to the south. The total 0.3-6.0 keV X-ray luminosity is ~2-5 x 10^(39) erg
s^(-1) (depending on the selected thermal plasma model). Most (~85%) of the
X-ray luminosity in NGC 3077 comes from the hot interstellar gas; the remainder
comes from six X-ray point sources. In spite of previous claims to the
contrary, we do not find X-ray emission originating from the prominent tidal
tail near NGC 3077.

These electrons are continuously introduced throughout the entire intracluster

  Relativistic Jet Sources"", eds R. P. Fender and J.-P. Macquart, in
  Astrophysics and Space Science. 10 pages, 1 figure",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Many compact radio sources like quasars, blazars, radio galaxies, and
micro-quasars emit circular polarisation (CP) with surprising temporal
persistent handedness. We propose that the CP is caused by Faraday conversion
of linear polarisation synchrotron light which propagates along a line-of-sight
through helical magnetic fields. Jet outflows from radio galaxies should have
the required magnetic helicity in the emission region due to the magnetic
torque of the accretion disc. Also advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF)
should contain magnetic fields with the same helicity. However, a jet region
seems to be the more plausible origin of CP. The proposed scenario requires
Faraday rotation (FR) to be insignificant in the emission region. The proposed
mechanism works in electron-positron e+/e- as well as electron-proton e/p
plasma. In the latter case, the emission region should consist of individual
flux tubes with independent polarities in order to suppress too strong FR - as
it was already proposed for FR based CP generation models. The predominant CP
is expected to mostly counter-rotate (rotation is measured here in
sky-projection) with respect to the central engine in all cases (jet or ADAF,
e+/e- or e/p plasma) and therefore allows to measure the sense of rotation of
quasar engines. The engine of SgrA* is expected - in this scenario - to rotate
clockwise and therefore counter-Galactic, as do the young hot stars in its
vicinity, which are thought to feed SgrA* by their winds. Generally, sources
with Stokes-V<0 (V>0) are expected to rotate clockwise

which we obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph at high
spectral resolution, in conjunction with simultaneous Chandra X-ray Observatory

fluxes, we have determined that the deepest UV absorption component covers at
least a portion of the inner, high-ionization narrow-line region (NLR). We find
nonunity covering factors in the cores of several kinematic components, which
increase the column density measurements of N V and C IV by factors of 1.2 to
1.9 over the full-covering case; however, the revised columns have only a minor
effect on the parameters derived from our photoionization models. For the first
time, we have simultaneous N V and C IV columns for component 1 (at -1040
km/s), and find that this component cannot be an X-ray warm absorber, contrary
to our previous claim based on nonsimultaneous observations. We find that
models of the absorbers based on solar abundances severely overpredict the O VI
columns previously obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectrograph, and present
arguments that this is not likely due to variability. However, models that
include either enhanced nitrogen (twice solar) or dust, with strong depletion
of carbon in either case, are successful in matching all of the observed ionic
columns. These models result in substantially lower ionization parameters and
total column densities compared to dust-free solar-abundance models, and
produce little O VII or O VIII, indicating that none of the UV absorbers are
X-ray warm absorbers.

of all known Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) binaries, it is important to reassess
their stability as bound pairs with respect to several disruptive mechanisms.
Besides the classical shattering and dispersing of the secondary due to a
high-velocity impact, we considered the possibility that the secondary is
kicked off its orbit by a direct collision of a small impactor, or that it is
gravitationally perturbed due to the close approach of a somewhat larger TNO.
  Depending on the values for the size/mass/separation of the binaries that we
used, 2 or 3 of the 8 pairs can be dispersed in a timescale shorter than the
age of the solar system in the current rarefied environment. A contemporary
formation scenario could explain why we still observe these binaries, but no
convincing mechanism has been proposed to date. The primordial formation
scenarios, which seem to be the only viable ones, must be revised to increase
the formation efficiency in order to account for this high dispersal rate.
Objects like the large-separatioKBO binary n2001 QW$_{322}$ must have been
initially an order of magnitude more numerous.
  If the KBO binaries are indeed primordial, then we show that the mass
depletion of the Kuiper belt cannot result from collisional grinding, but must
rather be due to dynamical ejection.

materials and its relation to the non-Fermi liquid physics observed near the
transition to the Fermi liquid. We explore the hypothesis that the primary
fluctuations responsible for the non-Fermi liquid physics are those associated
with the destruction of the large Fermi surface of the Fermi liquid. Magnetism
is suggested to be a low-energy instability of the resulting small Fermi
surface state. A concrete realization of this picture is provided by a
fractionalized Fermi liquid state which has a small Fermi surface of conduction
electrons, but also has other exotic excitations with interactions described by
a gauge theory in its deconfined phase. Of particular interest is a
three-dimensional fractionalized Fermi liquid with a spinon Fermi surface and a
U(1) gauge structure. A direct second-order transition from this state to the
conventional Fermi liquid is possible and involves a jump in the electron Fermi
surface volume. The critical point displays non-Fermi liquid behavior. A
magnetic phase may develop from a spin density wave instability of the spinon
Fermi surface. This exotic magnetic metal may have a weak ordered moment
although the local moments do not participate in the Fermi surface.
Experimental signatures of this phase and implications for heavy-fermion
systems are discussed.

AdS_5 supergravity results. To study this phenomenon at the two-loop level
(order g^4) we consider a particular N=2 hypermultiplet projection of the

explicitly compute this four-point correlator at two loops and identify the

of weight k=3 and k=4 the one-loop large N degeneracy is lifted by the two-loop
corrections. However, for weight k > 4 the degeneracy is still there at the

produce at the time of decoupling scale invariant density anisotropies over
cosmologically large comoving volumes. Scale invariance is shown to be a direct
consequence of the causality constrains imposed by the short FRW comoving
horizon at decoupling, which strongly suppress the power spectrum of density
fluctuations with cosmologically large comoving wavelength. The global
amplitude of these cosmological density anisotropies is fixed by the power
spectrum in comoving modes whose wavelength is shorter than the causal horizon
at the time and can be comparable to the amplitude of the primordial
cosmological inhomogeneities imprinted in the cosmic microwave background
radiation.

amend the lack of spectrum. As a result the model can be only interpreted in
the infra-red region. A direct comparison with the lattice data allows us to
fix the scale up to where the model is sensible to describe low-energy
observables. Nevertheless, taking for granted the lattice results, the
resulting spectrum does not follow the general trends found in other
supergravity backgrounds. We further discuss the decoupling of the non-singlet

envelope theory, it has earlier been proved that the P_{n\ell}(q) functions are
monotone increasing. Recent refinements to the comparison theorem of QM in
which comparison potentials can cross over, allow us to prove for n = 1 that
Q(q)=Z(q)P(q) is monotone increasing, even though the factor Z(q)=(1+q/N)^{1/q}
is monotone decreasing. Thus P(q) cannot increase too slowly. This result

  and tight closure","This is to appear in the Transactions of the American Mathematical
  Society",,,,"math.AC",,"  This paper is concerned with tight closure in a commutative Noetherian ring
$R$ of prime characteristic $p$, and is motivated by an argument of K. E. Smith
and I. Swanson that shows that, if the sequence of Frobenius powers of a proper
ideal $I$ of $R$ has linear growth of primary decompositions, then tight
closure (of $I$) commutes with localization at the powers of a single element.
It is shown in this paper that, provided $R$ has a weak test element, linear
growth of primary decompositions for other sequences of ideals of $R$ that
approximate, in a certain sense, the sequence of Frobenius powers of $I$ would
not only be just as good in this context, but, in the presence of a certain
additional finiteness property, would actually imply that tight closure (of
$I$) commutes with localization at an arbitrary multiplicatively closed subset
of $R$.
  Work of M. Katzman on the localization problem for tight closure raised the
question as to whether the union of the associated primes of the tight closures
of the Frobenius powers of $I$ has only finitely many maximal members. This
paper develops, through a careful analysis of the ideal theory of the perfect
closure of $R$, strategies for showing that tight closure (of a specified ideal
$I$ of $R$) commutes with localization at an arbitrary multiplicatively closed
subset of $R$ and for showing that the union of the associated primes of the
tight closures of the Frobenius powers of $I$ is actually a finite set. Several
applications of the strategies are presented; in most of them it was already
known that tight closure commutes with localization, but the resulting
affirmative answers to Katzman's question in the various situations considered
are believed to be new.

separator in the angular range 2.7-5.3 degrees. The velocities of the residues,
monotonically decreasing with Z down to Z~26-28, are employed to characterize
the excitation energy. The yield ratios R21(N,Z) for each pair of systems are
found to exhibit isotopic scaling (isoscaling), namely, an exponential
dependence on the fragment atomic number Z and neutron number N. The isoscaling
is found to occur in the residue Z range corresponding to the maximum observed
excitation energies. The corresponding isoscaling parameters are alpha=0.43 and
beta=-0.50 for the Kr+Sn system and alpha=0.27 and beta=-0.34 for the Kr+Ni
system. For the Kr+Sn system, for which the experimental angular acceptance
range lies inside the grazing angle, isoscaling was found to occur for Z<26 and
N<34. For heavier fragments from Kr+Sn, the parameters vary monotonically,
alpha decreasing with Z and beta increasing with N. This variation is found to
be related to the evolution towards isospin equilibration and, as such, it can
serve as a tracer of the N/Z equilibration process. The present heavy-residue
data extend the observation of isotopic scaling from the intermediate mass
fragment region to the heavy-residue region. Such high-resolution mass
spectrometric data can provide important information on the role of isospin in

reconstruct spatially varying refractive tensors or dielectric tensors from
measurements of the change of state of polarization of light beams passing
through the medium, a field which is known as Tensor Tomography. A special case

states. By controlling the tunneling rates onto these auxiliaries from the
qudits proper, we can controllably switch the entangling operations. We
consider a practical architecture in which to realize such a computer and
examine the associated Hilbert space dimension.

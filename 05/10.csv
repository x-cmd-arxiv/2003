J1808.4-3658 during quiescence was detected at V = 21.5 mag by Homer et al.
(2001). This star shows a 6% semi-amplitude sinusoidal modulation of its flux
at the orbital period of the system. It was proposed that the modulation arises
from X-ray irradiation of the intrinsically faint companion by a remnant
accretion disk, and that the bulk of the optical emission arises from viscous
dissipation in the disk. The serious difficulty in this scenario lies in the
estimate of the irradiating luminosity required to match the observational
data, that is a factor 10-50 higher than the quiescent X-ray luminosity of this
source. To overcome this problem, we propose an alternative scenario, in which
the irradiation is due to the release of rotational energy by the fast spinning
neutron star, switched on, as magneto-dipole rotator (radio pulsar), during
quiescence. Our computations indicate that the optical magnitudes are fully
consistent with this hypothesis. In this case the observed optical luminosity
may be the first evidence that a radio pulsar is active in this system in
quiescence, a key phase for understanding the evolution of this class of
objects.

13+1 traces out a curved track in the CDs on a time scale of hours, which is
very reminiscent of a standard atoll track containing an island, and lower and
upper banana branch. However, both count rate and power spectral properties
vary along this track in a very unusual way, not seen in any other atoll or Z
source. The count rate, which varied by a factor of ~1.6, along a given track
first decreases and then increases, causing the motion through the HIDs to be
in the opposite sense to that in the CD, contrary to all other Z and atoll
sources. Along a CD track, the very low frequency noise uniquely decreases in
amplitude from ~5 to ~2% (rms). The high frequency noise amplitude decreases
from ~4% to less than 1% and its characteristic frequency decreases from ~10 to
\~5 Hz. The 57-69 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) found earlier is also
detected, and no kHz QPOs are found. In addition the entire track shows secular
motion on a time scale of about a week. The average count rate as well as the

high-resolution, N-body/hydrodynamic simulations of a $\Lambda$CDM universe and
their role on thermalization of gas and acceleration of nonthermal, cosmic ray
(CR) particles. External shocks form around sheets, filaments and knots of mass
distribution when the gas in void regions accretes onto them. Within those
nonlinear structures, internal shocks are produced by infall of previously
shocked gas to filaments and knots, and during subclump mergers, as well as by
chaotic flow motions. Due to the low temperature of the accreting gas, the Mach
number of external shocks is high, extending up to $M\sim 100$ or higher. In
contrast, internal shocks have mostly low Mach numbers. For all shocks of
$M\ge1.5$ the mean distance between shock surfaces over the entire computed
volume is $\sim4 h^{-1}$ Mpc at present, or $\sim 1 h^{-1}$ Mpc for internal
shocks within nonlinear structures. Identified external shocks are more
extensive, with their surface area $\sim2$ times larger than that of identified
internal shocks at present. However, especially because of higher preshock
densities, but also due to higher shock speeds, internal shocks dissipate more
energy. Hence, the internal shocks are mainly responsible for gas
thermalization as well as CR acceleration. In fact, internal shocks with $2 \la
M \la 4$ contribute $\sim 1/2$ of the total dissipation. Using a nonlinear
diffusive shock acceleration model for CR protons, we estimate the ratio of CR
energy to gas thermal energy dissipated at cosmological shock waves to be
$\sim1/2$ through the history of the universe. Our result supports scenarios in
which the intracluster medium contains energetically significant populations of
CRs.

uniform magnetic fields of various strengths were added with Alfv\'enic Mach
number $<M_A >_{\rm init} \equiv < v >_{\rm rms} / c_{A, {\rm init}} \gg 1$. An
isothermal equation of state was employed, and no explicit dissipation was
included. After the MHD turbulence is saturated, the resulting flows are
categorized as very weak field (VWF), weak field (WF), and strong field (SF)
classes, which have $<M_A > \equiv < v >_{\rm rms} / < c_A >_{\rm rms} \gg 1$,
$<M_A > > 1$, and $<M_A > \sim 1$, respectively. Not only in the SF regime but
also in the WF regime, turbulent transport is suppressed by the magnetic field.
In the SF cases, the energy power spectra in the inertial range, although no
longer power-law, exhibit a range with slopes close to $\sim1.5$, hinting the
Iroshnikov-Kraichnan spectrum. Our simulations were able to produce the SF
class behaviors only with high resolution of at least $1024^2$ grid cells. The

polarized flat-spectrum central core coincident with the pulsar J1124-5916, a
surrounding circular steep-spectrum plateau with sharp outer edges and,
superimposed on the plateau, a series of radial filaments with spectra
significantly flatter than their surroundings. HI absorption argues for a lower

the thickness of the plateau region demonstrates that the forward and reverse

an ambient density ~0.9 cm^-3. We interpret the flat-spectrum radial filaments

self-consistent simulations of a realistic disc+halo galaxy model with a
disc-dominated, flat rotation curve. These simulations were run at high (N=20M
particles) and low (N=500K) resolution to test numerical convergence. We
determine the pattern speeds in simulations directly from the phase angle of
the bar versus time and the Tremaine-Weinberg method. Fundamental dynamics do
not change between the high and low resolution, suggesting that convergence has
been reached in this case. We find the higher resolution is needed to simulate
structural and kinematic properties accurately. The edge-on view of the
higher-resolution system clearly shows the bending instability and formation of
a peanut-shaped bulge. We determined bar lengths by different means to
determine the simulated bar is fast, with a corotation to bar length ratio
under 1.5. Simulated bars in these models form with pattern speeds slower than
those observed and slow down during their evolution. Dynamical friction between
the bar and dark halo is responsible for this deceleration, as revealed by the
transfer of angular momentum between the disc and the halo. However, even
though the pattern speed is reduced at later times, the instantaneous scale
length of the disc has grown sufficiently for the bar motion to agree with many
observations. By using a different model and simulation technique than other
authors, we are able to compare the robustness of these methods.

dwarfs, we detected a total of 71 X-ray flares. Most of the flares have the
typical profile of solar and stellar flares, fast rise and slow decay. We
derived the time-averaged temperature (kT), luminosity (L_X), rise and decay
timescales (tau_r and tau_d) of the flares, finding that (1) class I-II sources
tend to have a high kT, (2) the distribution of L_X during flares is nearly the
same for all classes, and (3) positive and negative log-linear correlations are
found between tau_r and tau_d, and kT and tau_r. In order to explain these
relations, we used the framework of magnetic reconnection model to formulate
the observational parameters as a function of the half-length of the
reconnected magnetic loop (L) and magnetic field strength (B). The estimated L
is comparable to the typical stellar radius of these objects (10^{10-11} cm),
which indicates that the observed flares are triggered by solar-type loops,
rather than larger ones (10^{12} cm) connecting the star with its inner
accretion disk. The higher kT observed for class I sources may be explained by
a higher magnetic field strength (about 500 G) than for class II-III sources
(200-300 G).

due to relativistic spin-orbit couplings and the absence of gerade/ungerade

electromagnetic radiation, and he applied them to a model of matter in thermal
equilibrium with radiation to derive Planck's black-body formula. Einstein's
treatment is extended here to time-dependent stochastic variables, which leads
to a master equation for the probability distribution that describes the
irreversible approach of Einstein's model towards thermal equilibrium, and
elucidates aspects of the foundation of statistical mechanics. An analytic
solution of this equation is obtained in the Fokker-Planck approximation which
is in excellent agreement with numerical results. At equilibrium, it is shown
that the probability distribution is proportional to the total number of
microstates for a given configuration, in accordance with Boltzmann's
fundamental postulate of equal a priori probabilities for these states. While
the counting of these configurations depends on particle statistics- Boltzmann,
Bose-Einstein, or Fermi-Dirac - the corresponding probability is determined
here by the dynamics which are embodied in the form of Einstein's quantum
transition probabilities for the emission and absorption of radiation. In a
special limit, it is shown that the photons in Einstein's model can act as a
thermal bath for the evolution of the atoms towards the canonical equilibrium
distribution of Gibbs. In this limit, the present model is mathematically
equivalent to an extended version of the Ehrenfests' ``dog-flea'' model, which
has been discussed recently by Ambegaokar and Clerk.

glass configurations that were obtained from cooling runs from T=2300K to 300K
with a cooling rate of about 10^12K/s. Already at temperatures as high as
4000K, most of the Al and Si atoms are four-fold coordinated by oxygen atoms.
Thus, the structure of AS2 is that of a disordered tetrahedral network. The
packing of AlO4 tetrahedra is very different from that of SiO4 tetrahedra in
that Al is involved with a relatively high probability in small-membered rings
and in triclusters in which an O atom is surrounded by four cations. We find as
typical configurations two-membered rings with two Al atoms in which the shared
O atoms form a tricluster. On larger length scales, the system shows a
microphase separation in which the Al-rich network structure percolates through
the SiO2 network. The latter structure gives rise to a prepeak in the static
structure factor at a wavenumber q=0.5\AA^{-1}. The comparison of experimental
X-ray data with the results from the simulation shows a good agreement for the
structure function. The diffusion dynamics in AS2 is found to be much faster

similar and that they are by a factor of 2-3 larger than the one for Si.

whether the black hole is large, intermediate, or small. The results of
previous works, concerning lower overtones for large black holes, are completed
here by obtaining higher overtones for all the three black hole regimes. There
are two major conclusions that one can draw from this work: First,
asymptotically for high overtones, all the modes are evenly spaced, and this
holds for all three types of regime, large, intermediate and small black holes,
independently of l, where l is the quantum number characterizing the angular
distribution; Second, the spacing between modes is apparently universal, in
that it does not depend on the field, i.e., scalar, electromagnetic and
gravitational QN modes all have the same spacing for high overtones. We are
also able to prove why scalar and gravitational perturbations are isospectral,
asymptotically for high overtones, by introducing appropriate superpartner
potentials.

the (non)self-consistency of theories whose Hamiltonians are constraints. The
constraints, from Hamilton's equations, generate the evolution, while the
evolution, in turn, must preserve the constraints. This closure requirement can
be used as a selection mechanism for general relativity starting from a very
simple set of assumptions. The configuration space is chosen to be a family of
$3 \times 3$ positive definite symmetric matrices on some bare 3-manifold. A
general Hamiltonian is constructed on this space of matrices which consists of
a single constraint per space point. It is assumed that this constraint looks
like an energy balance relationship. It will be the sum of a `kinetic' term
which is quadratic and undifferentiated in the momenta, and a `potential' term,
which is any function of the configuration variables. Further, the constraint
must be a scalar under the linear group, the natural symmetry group of the
configuration space. This inexorably leads to the ADM Hamiltonian for general
relativity. Both the space of Riemannian geometries (Wheeler's superspace), and

One-loop radiative corrections to the gauge couplings due to overlapping
effects of the compact dimensions and Wilson line vev's are computed for

the ``moduli'' space) of enhanced gauge symmetry cannot be smoothly reached

states are present in a Kaluza-Klein tower. An additional correction to the
gauge coupling exists in the effective field theory approach when for specific
Wilson lines vev's massless Kaluza-Klein states are present. This correction is
not recoverable by the limit alpha'->0 of the (infrared regularised) string

observed in experimental data at RHIC. A similar dependence of the antikaon to

predicts that both the antiproton to pion and the antikaon to pion ratio
decrease and approach those given by the perturbative QCD. Both collective flow

  Lorentz Violation In Electrodynamics: A Velocity Gauge Transformation
  Alternative","in Proceedings of the tenth Marcel Grossmann Meeting on General
  Relativity, Part B, pp 1455-1458, 2005",,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Recent studies of spacetime anisotropy in the context of local Lorentz
invariance (LLI) based on classical Michelson-Morley experiments, as well
Kennedy-Thorndyke tests, pointed out the existence of terms first order in v/c
and of angular signatures independent of v. This contribution replaces the
Lorentz symmetry by a velocity gauge transformation following an argument
centred on observability. Results show even and odd order terms and indicate
that motion is always underestimated in the spatiotemporal platform. Though LLI
is not recovered in exact special relativistic terms, the alternative looks
compatible with the relational aspects of general relativity (GR) with variable
speed of light models as well a nonzero photon mass. This raises the hypothesis
that Einstein equivalence principle, and consequently LLI, is a cornerstone of
GR, but not necessarily a fundamental one of SR

has been determined experimentally. We used an x-ray interferometer with a
reference sample containing sharp nuclear resonances to prepare a
phase-controlled x-ray beam. A sample with similar resonances was placed in the
beam but outside of the interferometer; hence our use of the term
``exo-interferometric.'' We show that the phase change of the x rays due to the
sample can be uniquely determined from the time-dependent transmitted
intensities. The energy response of the sample was reconstructed from the phase
and the intensity data with a resolution of 23neV.

the angular momentum of a quantum particle---corresponding to the classical

$\mathbf{\hat{l}}=\mathbf{r}\wedge(-i\hbar\mathbf{\nabla}
-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A})$ in the presence of an electromagnetic field. Thus,
despite the general opinion on the corresponding rules of quantization, the
eigenvalues of the angular momentum depend on the configuration of the
electromagnetic field. The usual rules of commutation
$[{\hat{l}}_i,{\hat{l}}_j]=i\hbar\epsilon_{ijk}{\hat{l}}_k$, that are at the
foundation of the calculus of angular momentum and of the theory of
\emph{spin}---and Bohm's example of the EPR argument---are not valid in the
presence of an electromagnetic field. The expected value of the operator
$\mathbf{\hat{l}}=-i\hbar\mathbf{r}\wedge\mathbf{\nabla}$ is not gauge
invariant, it depends on the calibration of the electrodynamic potentials.

fundamental insights into many physical phenomena and lead to interesting

inherently fault-tolerant quantum computation. This, however, requires to deal
with geometric phases in the presence of noise and interactions between
different physical subsystems. Despite the wealth of literature on the subject
of geometric phases very little is known about this very important case. Here
we report the first experimental study of geometric phases for mixed quantum
states. We show how different they are from the well understood, noiseless,
pure-state case.

unitary transformation formulation, the present paper obtains the exact
solutions to the time-dependent supersymmetric two-level multiphoton
Jaynes-Cummings model and the Chiao-Wu model that describes the propagation of
a photon inside the optical fiber. On the basis of the fact that the two-level
multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model possesses the supersymmetric structure, an
invariant is constructed in terms of the supersymmetric generators by working
in the sub-Hilbert-space corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of the
conserved supersymmetric generators (i.e., the time-independent invariant). By
constructing the effective Hamiltonian that describes the interaction of the
photon with the medium of the optical fiber, it is further verified that the
particular solution to the Schr\""{o}dinger equation is the eigenfunction of the
second-quantized momentum operator of photons field. This, therefore, means
that the explicit expression (rather than the hidden form that involves the
chronological product) for the time-evolution operator of wave function is
obtained by means of the invariant theories.

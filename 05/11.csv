medium of the Milky Way. This part of the spectrum is dominated by a series of
strong, wide emission features commonly called the Unidentified Infrared Bands.
The sampled area covers the inner Milky Way from l = -60 degr to +60 degr with
a ten-degree step in galactic longitude and nominal latitudes 0,+-1 degr. For
each grid position the actual observed direction was selected from IRAS 100
micron maps to minimize contamination by point sources and molecular clouds.
All spectra were found to display the same spectral features. Band ratios are
independent of band strength and Galactic coordinates. A comparison of total
observed flux in band features and IRAS 100 micron emission, a tracer for large
interstellar dust grains, shows high correlation at large as well as small
1-arcmin scales. This implies a strong connection between large dust grains and
the elusive band carriers; the evolutionary history and heating energy source
of these populations must be strongly linked. The average mid-infrared spectrum
of the Milky Way is found to be similar to the average spectrum of spiral
galaxy NGC 891 and the spectra of other spirals. The common spectrum can
therefore be used as a template for the 6-12 micron emission of late-type
spiral galaxies. Finally, we show that interstellar extinction only weakly
influences the observed features even at lambda = 10 microns, where the
silicate absorption feature is strongest.

were previously known and already confirmed by spectroscopy. Based on the
available data we show that there is significant evidence for substructure in
one of the clusters, and an increasing fraction of blue galaxies towards larger

coincide with red clumps of galaxies. We estimate their redshifts and masses.

mass distribution within each halo. The description of halos as nonsingular,
truncated isothermal spheres, a particular solution of the isothermal
Lane-Emden equation (suitably modified for Lambda nonzero), has proved to be a
useful approximation for the halos which form from realistic initial conditions
in a CDM universe. The nonsingular TIS model reproduces many of the
quantitative features of the N-body results for CDM halos, except in the very
center, where CDM N-body halos show density profiles which vary as rho ~
r^(-alpha), alpha>1, instead of a small flat core. Possible discrepancies
between these cuspy halo predictions of the CDM N-body simulations and
observations of the inner mass profiles of dwarf and LSB disk galaxies based
upon their rotation curves and of clusters based upon strong lensing
measurements have led to a search for other diagnostics. A description of the
lensing by TIS halos would be useful in this regard, as a self-consistent model
for CDM halos in a proper cosmological context, nonsingular but otherwise
consistent with the CDM N-body results. We derive here the basic lensing
properties of individual TIS halos. For comparison, we also consider three
singular profiles: the Navarro-Frenk-White density profile, the singular
isothermal sphere, and the Schwarzschild lens. For all profiles, we compute the
critical curves and caustics, the image separation, the magnification and
brightness ratio, the shear, the time delay, and the average shear inside the
tidal radius. This provides tools for studying the statistical properties of
lensing by TIS and other lenses in the context of a theory of cosmological
structure formation.

qualitatively different dynamics. The predictions agree with measurements of
surface roughness relaxation. Using a theoretical model for the kinetics of
surface roughness relaxation in the presence of charges and optical electrical
fields, we predict that the high-frequency electromagnetic field increases both
the effective surface tension and the surface diffusion constant and thus
accelerates the surface smoothing kinetics and time scale of the Raman
fluctuations in manner that is linear with the laser power intensity, while the
addition of salt retards the surface relaxation kinetics and increases the time
scale of the fluctuations. These predictions are in qualitative agreement with
the Raman experiments.

  and May 2003; to appear in Selecta Mathematica (N.S.)","Selecta Mathematica 10 (2004), 37-60",,,"math.CO math.AG",,"  We introduce notions of combinatorial blowups, building sets, and nested sets
for arbitrary meet-semilattices. This gives a common abstract framework for the
incidence combinatorics occurring in the context of De Concini-Procesi models
of subspace arrangements and resolutions of singularities in toric varieties.
Our main theorem states that a sequence of combinatorial blowups, prescribed by
a building set in linear extension compatible order, gives the face poset of
the corresponding simplicial complex of nested sets. As applications we trace
the incidence combinatorics through every step of the De Concini-Procesi model
construction, and we introduce the notions of building sets and nested sets to
the context of toric varieties.
  There are several other instances, such as models of stratified manifolds and
certain graded algebras associated with finite lattices, where our
combinatorial framework has been put to work; we present an outline in the end
of this paper.

cohomology of Lie (super)algebra based on partition of the whole cochain
complex into minimal subcomplexes. We replace the arithmetic of rational
numbers or integers by a much cheaper arithmetic of a modular field and use the
inequality between the dimensions of cohomology H over any modular field F_p =
Z/pZ and over Q: dim H(F_p) >= dim H(Q). With this inequality we can, by
computing over arbitrary F_p, quickly find the (usually, rare) subcomplexes for
which dim H(F_p) > 0 and then carry out the full computation over Q within
these subcomplexes. We also present the results of application of the
corresponding C program to the Lie superalgebra of special vector fields
preserving an ""odd-symplectic"" structure on the (2|2)-dimensional
supermanifold. For this algebra, we found some new basis elements of the
cohomology in the trivial module.

  N.V.Ivanov",,,,"math.GT math.GR",,"  The mixed braid groups are the subgroups of Artin braid groups whose elements
preserve a given partition of the base points. We prove that the centralizer of
any braid can be expressed in terms of semidirect and direct products of mixed
braid groups. Then we construct a generating set of the centralizer of any
braid on n strands, which has at most k(k+1)/2 elements if n=2k, and at most
$k(k+3)/2 elements if n=2k+1. These bounds are shown to be sharp, due to work
of N.V.Ivanov and of S.J.Lee. Finally, we describe how one can explicitly
compute this generating set.

compared from the practical point of view. As an efficient cryptanalysis tool
for chaos encryption, a proposal based on the Error Function Attack is
presented systematically and used to evaluate system security. We define a
quantitative measure (Quality Factor) of the effective applicability of a chaos
encryption scheme, which takes into account the security, the encryption speed,
and the robustness against channel noise. A comparison is made of several
encryption schemes and it is found that a scheme based on one-way coupled
chaotic map lattices performs outstandingly well, as judged from Quality
Factor.

investigated. Before the transition to chaos, due to the effect of noise, a
typical trajectory will wander between the periodic attractor and its nearby
chaotic saddle in an intermittent way, forms a strange attractor gradually. The
existence of SNAs is confirmed by simulation results of various critera both in

behavior is studied by peoperties of local Lyapunov exponent. The universality
and generalization of this kind of SNAs are discussed and common features are
concluded.

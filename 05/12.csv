Effect on Incoherent Light"" (CREIL) which is obtained do not depend on the

CREIL does not blur the images and the spectra, its shifts may be confused with
Doppler shifts. ISRS and CREIL are parametric effects which do not excite the
matter, transferring energy from hot beams to cold beams; for CREIL, the cold
light is thermal radiation which is heated.
  CREIL requires low pressure gases acting as catalysts. These gases must have
Raman transitions in the radiofrequencies range: for instance H2+ or excited
atomic hydrogen in a magnetic field.
  The spectral lines resulting from a simultaneous absorption (or emission) and
CREIL have a width at least equal to the frequency shift, so that the lines of
a complex spectrum may be weakened and mixed, becoming nearly invisible. In
astrophysics, molecular hydrogen is ionised, but so quickly destroyed by
collisions that it persists only at pressures low enough to provide CREIL: Thus
it is invisible. It contributes to the ""cosmological redshift"" and to an
amplification of the 2.7K radiation.
  Using CREIL, the interpretation of the spectra of the quasars requires only
usual laws of physics, usual matter and usual astronomical objects: a star, an
accretion disk, satellites in a plasma of atomic hydrogen.

to simultaneously reproduce the light curve near peak and at the linear decline

model consisting of two concentric components. The outer component is
responsible for the early part of the light curve and for the broad absorption
features observed in the early spectra of hypernovae, similar to the
one-dimensional models. In addition, a very dense inner component is added,
which reproduces the linear decline phase in the observed magnitude-versus-time
relation for SNe 1998bw, 1997ef, and 2002ap. This simple approach does contain
one of the main features of jet-driven, asymmetric explosion models, namely the
presence of a dense core. Although the total masses and energies derived with
the two-component model are similar to those obtained in previous studies which
also adopted spherical symmetry, this study suggests that the ejecta are
aspherical, and thus the real energies and masses may deviate from those
derived assuming spherical symmetry. The supernovae which were modeled are
divided into two groups, according to the prominence of the inner component:
the inner component of SN 1997ef is denser and more $^{56}$Ni-rich, relative to
the outer component, than the corresponding inner components of SNe 1998bw and

distributions of both the clusters in the circumnuclear ring in NGC 3310 and of
those outside the ring are statistically indistinguishable, but there is a
clear and significant excess of higher-mass clusters IN the ring compared to
the non-ring cluster sample; it is likely that the physical conditions in the
starburst ring may be conducive for the formation of higher-mass star clusters,
on average, than in the relatively more quiescent environment of the main
galactic disc. For the NGC 6745 cluster system we derive a median age of ~10
Myr. NGC 6745 contains a significant population of high-mass ""super star
clusters"", with masses in the range 6.5 <= log(M_cl/M_sun) <= 8.0. This
detection supports the scenario that such objects form preferentially in the
extreme environments of interacting galaxies. The age of the cluster
populations in both NGC 3310 and NGC 6745 is significantly lower than their

the nematic phase is instable in bulk, while, if the distance between the walls
is small enough, an orientation-ordered phase can form. This result indicates
that the required molecular elongation forming liquid-crystal phases is smaller
in confinement than that in bulk. Considering the value of the elongation of

embedding Hitchin systems into the functional integral of a partially quenched

gauge orbits of the microcanonical ensemble and by changing variables from the
moduli fields of Hitchin systems to the moduli of the corresponding holomorphic
de Rham local systems. The key point is that the contour integral that occurs
in the loop equations for the de Rham local systems can be reduced to the
computation of a residue in a certain regularization. The outcome is that, for
self-avoiding loops, the original loop equations are implied by the critical
equation of an effective action computed in terms of the localisation
determinant and of the Jacobian of the change of variables to the de Rham local
systems. We check, at lowest order in powers of the moduli fields, that the

a trap width that is the size of an atom -- as might have been supposed -- but
it suffices merely to have a trap width such that the energy gap for motion in
the transverse direction is large compared to the energy associated with the
motion along the trap. Up to now the theoretical arguments have been based on
variational - perturbative ideas or numerical investigations. In contrast, this
paper gives a rigorous proof of the one-dimensional behavior as far as the
ground state energy and particle density are concerned. There are four
parameters involved: the particle number, $N$, transverse and longitudinal
dimensions of the trap, $r$ and $L$, and the scattering length $a$ of the
interaction potential. Our main result is that if $r/L\to 0$ and $N\to\infty$
the ground state energy and density can be obtained by minimizing a

been long believed that any degree 2 map S^3 -> S^3, obtained by capping off at

non-realizable in R^6. We show that there exists a self-map of the Poincar\'e

realizable in R^{2n} for each n>2. The latter together with a ten-line proof
for n=2, due essentially to M. Yamamoto, implies that every inverse limit of
n-spheres embeds in R^{2n} for n>1, which settles R. Daverman's 1990 problem.
If M is a closed orientable 3-manifold, we show that there exists a map S^3 ->
M, non-realizable in R^6, if and only if \pi_1(M) is finite and has even order.
  As a byproduct, an element of the stable stem \Pi_3 with non-trivial stable
Hopf invariant is represented by a particularly simple immersion S^3 -> R^4,
namely the composition of the universal 8-covering over Q^3=S^3/{\pm1,\pm i,\pm

homogeneous and is described by the set of ""shell velocities"" $u_{nj}(t)$ for
turbulent fluctuations of the scale $\propto 2^{-n}$. The MZS-model includes a

that is pulled from a hot oven towards a cold bath. This problem had been
carefully studied in a number of experiments that offer a wealth of data to
challenge the theory. We improve upon previous theoretical treatments in a
number of ways. First, we offer a technical improvement of the discussion of
the instability towards the creation of a straight crack. This improvement
consists of employing Pad\'e approximants to solve the relevant Weiner-Hopf
factorization problem that is associated with this transition. Next we improve
the discussion of the onset of oscillatory instability towards an undulating
crack. We offer a novel way of considering the problem as a sum of solutions of
a finite strip without a crack and an infinite medium with a crack. This allows
us to present a closed form solution of the stress intensity factors in the
vicinity of the oscillatory instability. Most importantly we develop a {\em
dynamical} description of the actual trajectory in the regime of oscillatory
crack. This theory is based on the dynamical law for crack propagation proposed
by Hodgdon and Sethna. We show that this dynamical law results in a solution of
the actual track trajectory in post critical conditions; we can compute from
first principles the critical value of the control parameters, and the
characteristics of the solution like the wavelength of the oscillations. We
present detailed comparison with experimental measurements without any free
parameter. The comparison appears quite excellent. Lastly we show that the
dynamical law can be translated to an equation for the amplitude of the
oscillatory crack; this equation predicts correctly the scaling exponents
observed in experiments.

the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the effective Hamiltonian of an open

state $k$ with neighboured states $l\ne k$ via the continuum. It is energy
dependent since the coupling coefficients between the state $k$ and the
continuum show a resonance-like behaviour at the energies of the neighboured
states $l\ne k$. Under certain conditions, the energy dependent $\tilde q_k(E)$
are equivalent to the generalized complex energy independent Fano parameters

Long-lived states appear mostly isolated from one another in the cross section,
also when they are overlapped by short-lived resonance states. The $\tilde

controlling them as a function of an external parameter.

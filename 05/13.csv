properties of peculiar velocities of dark matter halos. We pay particular
attention to the following two effects; first, the evolution of the halo
peculiar velocity depends on the local matter density, instead of the global
density. Second, dark matter halos are biased tracers of the underlying mass
distribution, thus halos tend to be located preferentially at high density
regions. For the former, we develop an empirical model calibrated with N-body
simulations, while for the latter, we use a conventional halo bias models based
on the extended Press-Schechter model combined with an empirical log-normal
probability distribution function of the mass density distribution. We find
that compared with linear theory, the present model significantly improves the
accuracy of predictions of statistical properties of the halo peculiar velocity
field including the velocity dispersion, the probability distribution function,
and the pairwise velocity dispersion at large separations. Thus our model
predictions may be useful in analyzing future observations of the peculiar
velocities of galaxy clusters.

of galaxies require a more top-heavy IMF. We attribute an excess heavy element
production to an IMF evolution with redshift. Dating the galaxy formation in
clusters by observations of the star-formation rate, we conclude that the IMF
variations have occurred preferentially at z>~4. We further combine our
metallicity measurements with the mass function of clusters to estimate the
role of clusters in the evolution of the metal content of the Universe. We
argue that at no epoch stars are a major container of metals, unless groups of

the universe at the present epoch. We present here dimensionless coordinate
distances y(z) to twenty radio galaxies reaching out to z of about 1.8, the
redshift range currently not covered by Supernova standard candle observations.
We develop a simple numerical method for a direct determination of the
expansion and acceleration rates, E(z) and q(z), from the data, which makes no
assumptions about the underlying cosmological model or the equation of state
parameter w. This differential method is in contrast to the traditional
cosmological tests, where particular model equations are integrated and then
compared with the observations. The new model-independent method is applied to
currently available Supernova data and the data on radio galaxies presented
here. We derive the expansion rate of the universe as a function of redshift,
E(z), and for the first time obtain a direct estimate of the acceleration rate
of the universe as a function of redshift, q(z), in a way that is independent
of assumptions regarding the dark energy and its redshift evolution. The
current observations indicate that the universe transitions from acceleration
to deceleration at a redshift greater than 0.3, with a best fit estimate of
about 0.45; this transition redshift and our determinations of E(z) are broadly
in agreement with the currently popular Friedmann-Lemaitre cosmology with Omega
= 0.3, and Lambda = 0.7, even though no model assumptions are made in deriving
the fits for E(z) and q(z).

potentials which have been proposed to describe realistic ellipticals. Earlier
work is extended by exploring the effects of (1) variable axis ratios, (2)
`graininess' associated with stars and bound substructures, idealised as
friction and white noise, and (3) large-scale organised motions presumed to
induce near-random forces idealised as coloured noise with finite
autocorrelation time. Three important conclusions are: (1) not all the chaos
can be attributed to the cusp; (2) significant chaos can persist even for
axisymmetric systems; and (3) introducing a supermassive black hole can
increase both the relative number of chaotic orbits and the size of the largest
Lyapunov exponent. Sans perturbations, distribution functions associated with
initially localised chaotic ensembles evolve exponentially towards a nearly
time-independent form at a rate L that correlates with the finite time Lyapunov
exponents associated with the evolving orbits. Perturbations accelerate phase
space transport by increasing the rate of phase mixing in a given phase space
region and by facilitating diffusion along the Arnold web that connects
different phase space regions, thus facilitating an approach towards a true
equilibrium. The details of the perturbation appear unimportant. All that
matters are the amplitude and the autocorrelation time, upon which there is a
weak logarithmic dependence. Even comparatively weak perturbations can increase
L by a factor of three or more, a fact that has potentially significant
implications for violent relaxation.

physically-motivated subgrid model of the isothermal cloud collapse. The first
clusters in the simulation form at z ~ 12, while we conjecture that the best
conditions for GC formation appear to be at z ~ 3-5. Most clusters form in the
progenitor galaxies of the virial mass >10^9 Msun and the total mass of the
cluster population is strongly correlated with the mass of its host galaxy with
a fraction ~2x10^-4 of the galactic baryons being in the form of GCs. In
addition, the mass of the GC population and the maximum cluster mass in a given
region strongly correlate with the local average star formation rate. We find
that the mass, size, and metallicity distributions of the cluster population
identified in the simulation are remarkably similar to the corresponding
distributions of the Milky Way globulars. We find no clear mass-metallicity or
age-metallicity correlations for the old clusters. The zero-age cluster mass
function can be approximated by a power-law, dN/dM ~ M^-alpha, with alpha ~ 2,
in agreement with the mass function of young stellar clusters in starbursting
galaxies. However, the shape of the zero-age mass function may be better
described by the high-mass tail of a lognormal distribution which peaks at
~10^3 Msun. We discuss in detail the origin, universality, and dynamical
evolution of the globular cluster mass function. Our results indicate that
globular clusters with properties similar to those of observed clusters can

describes numerical simulations of the light propagation in the gravitational

The simulations include high-precision numerical integrations of both
post-Newtonian and post-Minkowskian differential equations of light propagation
and a detailed comparison of the results of the numerical integrations with
various available approximate analytical formulas. The simulations has been
performed both for hypothetical bodies with various parameters of trajectories
as well as for all the major bodies of the solar system using the JPL ephemeris
DE405/LE405 to calculate their motion.
  It is shown that for the accuracy of $\sim 0.2$ $\mu$as it is sufficient to
use the well-known solution for the light propagation in the field of a
motionless mass monopole and substitute in that solution the position of the
body at the moment of closest approach between the actual trajectory of the
body and the unperturbed light path (as it was first suggested by Hellings
(1986)). For a higher accuracy one should use either the post-Newtonian
solution for uniformly moving bodies (Klioner & Kopeikin, 1992) or the
post-Minkowskian solution for arbitrarily moving bodies (Kopeikin & Schaefer,
1999). For astrometric observations performed from within the solar system
these two solutions guarantee the accuracy of $\sim 0.002$ $\mu$as and are
virtually indistinguishable from each other.

and did not receive an energetic trigger from a nearby supernova. The
progenitor of the black hole had an initial mass greater than 40 solar masses
and during the collapse to form the ~10 solar mass black hole of Cygnus X-1,
the upper limit for the mass that could have been suddenly ejected is ~1 solar
mass, much less than the mass ejected in a supernova. The observations suggest
that high-mass stellar black holes may form promptly, when massive stars
disappear silently.

calculations, we aim to determine the mass-loss history of these stars by
fitting the CO line intensities. We find that the observed line intensities of
the high transitions, including the J = 4 -> 3 transition, are significantly
lower than the predicted values. We conclude that the physical structure of the
outflow of Asymptotic Giant Branch stars is more complex than previously
thought. In order to understand the observed line intensities and profiles, a
physical structure with a variable mass-loss rate and/or a gradient in
stochastic gas velocity is required. A case study of the AGB star WX Psc is
performed. We find that the CO line strengths may be explained by variations in
mass-loss on time scales similar to those observed in the separated arc-like
structures observed around post-AGB stars. In addition, a gradient in the
stochastic velocity may play a role. Until this has been sorted out fully, any
mass loss determinations based upon single CO lines will remain suspect.

intermittency. Our most surprising conclusion is that in ordinary strong MHD
turbulence the velocity and magnetic fields show different high-order structure
function scalings. Moreover this scaling depends on whether the intermittency
is viewed in a global or local system of reference. This reconciles seemingly
contradictory earlier results. On the other hand, the intermittency scaling for
viscosity-damped turbulence is very different, and difficult to understand in
terms of the usual phenomenological models for intermittency in turbulence. Our
remaining results are in reasonable agreement with expectations. First, we find
that our high resolution simulations for ordinary MHD turbulence show that the
energy spectra are {\it compatible} with a Kolmogorov spectrum, while
viscosity-damped turbulence shows a shallow $k^{-1}$ spectrum for the magnetic
fluctuations. Second, a new numerical technique confirms that ordinary MHD
turbulence exhibits Goldreich-Sridhar type anisotropy, while viscosity-damped
MHD turbulence shows extremely anisotropic eddy structures. Finally, we show
that many properties of incompressible turbulence for both the ordinary and
viscosity-damped regimes carry over to the case of compressible turbulence.

photometry is complemented by Halpha imaging, which provides information about
the distribution of star forming regions across the galaxies. Long-slit
spectroscopic data obtained at different position angles of the slit are
employed to determine the physical conditions of circumnuclear and extranuclear
regions. A mixture of thermal and non-thermal ionizing radiation is found in
the surroundings of the nucleus of Tol1238-364 and the energy budget supports
the presence of a circumnuclear starburst.Several regions in both the galaxies
show anomalous line ratios: additional ionization by shock-heating and low
ionization of some extranuclear HII regions are suggested as possible
explanations. An analysis of the emission-line profiles reveals the presence of
a broad Halpha component in the nuclear region of Tol1238-364. Independent
estimates of the star formation rates (SFR) were obtained through
flux-calibrated Halpha-images and FIR emission in the four IRAS bands. Overall
SFR densities have been compared with the SFR densities derived from Halpha
emission in the individual regions of the galaxies sampled by long-slit

modelled by a `quintessence' scalar field, and cold dark matter with space-time
varying mass is studied. Models of this type, where the variable mass is
induced by dependence on the scalar field, as suggested by string theory or
extra-dimensions, have been proposed as a viable solution of the coincidence
problem. A general framework for the study of the non-linear phases of
structure formation in scalar field cosmologies is provided, starting from a
general relativistic treatment of the combined dark matter-dark energy system.
As a first application, the mildly non-linear evolution of dark matter
perturbations is obtained by a straightforward extension of the Zel'dovich
approximation. We argue that the dark energy fluctuations may play an active
role in cosmological structure formation if the scalar field effective
potential develops a temporary spinodal instability during the evolution.

the complete submillimetre spectrum of this nearby edge-on spiral galaxy. We
derive submillimetre emission profiles along the major axis. The modified
blackbody fits, assuming a single dust component, lead to temperatures of 19-24
K toward the centre and 18-20 K toward the edges, with possible variations of
the dust spectral index from 1.4 to 2. The two-component fits lead to a warm
component temperature of 29 K all along the galaxy with a cold component at 16
K. The interstellar medium masses derived by these two methods are quite
different: 4.6 x 10^9 Mo in the case of the one-component model and 12 x 10^9
Mo in the case of the two-component one. This two-component fit indicates that
the cold dust to warm dust ratio is 20 to 40, the highest values being in the
wings of this galaxy. Comparing to dust mass estimates, both estimations of the
ISM mass are consistent with a gas to dust mass ratio of 240, which is close to
the Milky Way value. Our results illustrate the importance of accurate

was estimated as $\sim$21% at 2.5 K; thus, this magnetic transition was not
induced by impurities but is an intrinsic change in the magnetism of the
sample, although the sample was magnetically inhomogeneous otherwise. On the
other hand, a similar experiment on a Na$_{0.65}$CoO$_2$ sample exhibited no
magnetic transition down to 2.5 K; which indicates that the average valence of
the Co ions is responsible for inducing the magnetic transition at 22 K.

a variant of the Ramsey problem for the class of complete bipartite

loops, are allowed.) Unlike the conventional m-coloring scheme in Ramsey theory
which imposes a constraint (i.e., $m$) on the total number of colors allowed in
a graph, we introduce a relaxed version called m-local coloring which only
requires that, for every vertex $v$, the number of colors associated with $v$'s
incident edges is bounded by $m$. Note that the number of colors found in a
graph under $m$-local coloring may exceed m. We prove that given any $n \times
n$ complete bipartite multigraph $G$, every shuffle-preserved $m$-local
coloring displays a monochromatic copy of $K_{p,p}$ provided that $2(p-1)(m-1)
< n$. Moreover, the above bound is tight when (i) $m=2$, or (ii) $n=2^k$ and

presence of an antisymmetric tensor field related to a lack of commutatitivity
of spacetime coordinates at the Planck era. For this purpose, such a field is
promoted to a dynamical variable, inspired by tensor formalism. By working to
quadratic order in the antisymmetric tensor, we study the field equations in a
Bianchi I universe in two models: an antisymmetric tensor plus scalar field
coupled to gravity, or a cosmological constant and a free massless
antisymmetric tensor. In the first scenario, numerical integration shows that,
in the very early universe, the effects of the antisymmetric tensor can prevail
on the scalar field, while at late times the former approaches zero and the
latter drives the isotropization of the universe. In the second model, an
approximate solution is obtained of a nonlinear ordinary differential equation
which shows how the mean Hubble parameter and the difference between
longitudinal and orthogonal Hubble parameter evolve in the early universe.

are viable due to the fact that the only light non-singlet (and, therefore,
potentially visible) Higgs boson, $h$, decays mainly to two CP-odd light Higgs

that this signal may be detectable at the LHC as a signal/background $\sim

study gives us confidence that the shape of the background tail is predictable,

throughout all of parameter space by combining this signal with the usual

fluxes, E^-2 and E^-1, calibrated to GZK-like and Z-Burst-like models, we
estimate that at E= 10^19 eV nearly half a dozen horizontal shower events
should be detected by EUSO in three years of data collection by the
""guaranteed"" GZK neutrino flux. We also find that the equivalent mass for an
Earth outer layer made of rock is dominant compared to the water, contrary to
simplified all-rock/all-water Earth models and previous Montecarlo simulations.
Therefore we expect an enhancement of neutrino detection along continental
shelves nearby the highest mountain chains, also given the better geometrical
acceptance for Earth skimming neutrinos. The Auger experiment might reveal such
a signature at E_nu= 10^{18} eV (with 26 events in 3 yr) towards the Andes, if
the angular resolution at the horizon (both in azimuth and zenith) would reach
an accuracy of nearly one degree needed to disentangle tau air showers from

suggest an extension of the EUSO and Auger sensitivity down to (or even below)

find that a model with a scale-invariant scalar power spectrum ($n=1$), no
tensor contribution, and no running of the spectral index, is within the
1-$\sigma$ contours of both data sets. We then apply the Monte Carlo
reconstruction technique to both data sets to generate an ensemble of
inflationary potentials consistent with observations. None of the three basic
classes of inflation models (small-field, large-field, and hybrid) are
completely ruled out, although hybrid models are favored by the best-fit
region. The reconstruction process indicates that a wide variety of smooth
potentials for the inflaton are consistent with the data, implying that the
first-year WMAP result is still too crude to constrain significantly either the
height or the shape of the inflaton potential. In particular, the lack of
evidence for tensor fluctuations makes it impossible to constrain the energy
scale of inflation. Nonetheless, the data rule out a large portion of the
available parameter space for inflation. For instance, we find that potentials
of the form $V = \lambda \phi^4$ are ruled out to $3\sigma$ by the combined
data set, but not by the WMAP data taken alone.

Strong Energy Condition [SEC], there is little hope of avoiding the
singularities which plague S-Brane spacetimes. Meanwhile, however, Townsend and
Wohlfarth have suggested an ingenious way of circumventing the SEC in such
situations, and other suggestions for actually violating it in the S-Brane
context have recently been proposed. Of course, the natural context for
discussions of [effective or actual] violations of the SEC is the theory of
asymptotically deSitter spacetimes, which tend to be less singular than
ordinary FRW spacetimes. However, while violating or circumventing the SEC is
necessary if singularities are to be avoided, it is not at all clear that it is
sufficient. That is, we can ask: would an asymptotically deSitter S-brane
spacetime be non-singular? We show that this is difficult to achieve; this
result is in the spirit of the recently proved ""S-brane singularity theorem"".
Essentially our results suggest that circumventing or violating the SEC may not
suffice to solve the S-Brane singularity problem, though we do propose two ways
of avoiding this conclusion.

We consider quantum states with finite mass and finite kinetic energy, and the
self-consistent potential is the unbounded Coulomb interaction. This model is
first formulated as a semi-linear evolution problem for the one-particle
density matrix operator lying in the space of Hermitian trace class operators.
Using semigroup techniques and generalized Lieb-Thierring inequalities we then
prove global existence and uniqueness of mild and classical solutions. To this
end we prove that the quadratic Hartree-Fock terms are locally Lipschitz in the
space of trace class operators with finite kinetic energy. Technically, the
main challenge stems from considering the model as an evolution problem for
operators. Hence, many standard tools of PDE-analysis (density results, e.g.)
are not readily available for the density matrix formalism.

of the phase transition, the thermodynamical functions, the heavy quark free

received extensive study, the lowest order probability distribution function
(PDF) -- the probability that a unit volume of space will emit a given amount
of light -- has received very little attention. We estimate this function with
the aid of hydrodynamic simulations of the Lambda CDM model, finding it
significantly different from the mass density PDF, and not simply related to it
by linear bias or any of the other prescriptions commonly adopted. If the
optical light PDF is, in reality, similar to what we find in the simulations,
then some measures of Omega_M based on mass-to-light ratio and the cosmic
virial theorem will have significantly underestimated Omega_M. Basically, the
problem is one of selection bias, with galaxy forming regions being
unrepresentative of the dark matter distribution in a way not described by
linear bias. Knowledge of the optical PDF and the plausible assumption of a
log-normal distribution for the matter PDF will allow one to correct for these
selection biases. We find that this correction (which amounts to 20-30%) brings
the values of Omega_M estimated by using the mass-to-light ratio and the cosmic
virial theorem to the range 0.2-0.3, in better agreement with the WMAP result
than the uncorrected estimates. In addition, the relation between mass and
light PDFs gives us insight concerning the nature of the void phenomenon. In
particular our simulation indicates that 20% of mass is distributed in voids,
which occupy 85% of volume in the universe.

observations of stellar black hole binaries during the spectrally hard X-ray
state, finding evidence for a strong correlation between these two bands over
more than three orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity. The correlation
extends from the quiescent regime up to close to the soft state transition,
where radio emission starts to decline, sometimes below detectable levels,
probably corresponding to the physical disappearance of the jet. The X-ray
transient V 404 Cygni is found to display the same functional relationship
already reported for GX 339-4 between radio and X-ray flux, namely S_radio
\propto S_X **(+0.7). In fact the data for all low/hard state black holes is
consistent with a universal relation between the radio and X-ray luminosity of
the form L_radio \propto L_X **(+0.7), implying that - as L_X decreases - the
jet becomes more radiatively efficient with respect to the X-rays. Under the
hypothesis of common physics driving the disc-jet coupling in different
sources, the observed spread to the best-fit relation can be interpreted in
terms of a distribution in Doppler factors. Monte Carlo simulations show that,
assuming little or no X-ray beaming, the measured scatter in radio power is
consistent with Lorentz factors < 2 for the outflows in the low/hard state,
significantly less relativistic than the jets associated with X-ray transients.
When combined radio and X-ray beaming is considered, the range of possible jet
bulk velocities significantly broadens, allowing highly relativistic outflows,
but implying therefore severe X-ray selection effects.

J-band imaging data, obtained with ISAAC at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of
the European Southern Observatory (ESO). As one of the best-studied QSOs with
exceptional properties lying between those of QSOs, narrow-line Seyfert 1s, and
ultraluminous infrared galaxies, I Zw 1 is a prime candidate for a detailed
case study of a QSO host. With its high angular resolution and sensitivity, the
new J-band image provides strong evidence for an interaction between I Zw 1 and
the western companion galaxy. We present a procedure for subtracting the QSO
nucleus from the I Zw 1 image to obtain an undisturbed view on the underlying
host galaxy. Based on the derived surface brightness profile and the gas
rotation curve, the host is classified as a high-surface-brightness Freeman
type I galaxy with a central disk surface brightness significantly larger than
that of normal spirals. The surface-brightness profile is decomposed into a
Plummer bulge and a Kuzmin disk with similar luminosities and a bulge-to-disk
scale length ratio of 0.29, comparable to that of nearby spiral hosts with
active galactic nuclei (AGN). Different models for the decomposition of the gas
rotation curve are discussed. The resulting J-band mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of
(0.7+/-0.4) M_sun/L_sun for the disk component suggests a mean solar-type
stellar population with a tendency towards young stars. The bulge exhibits a
lower M/L of 0.4+/-0.2 M_sun/L_sun, which supports previous findings of
enhanced starburst activity in the nuclear and circumnuclear region.

significant arrival time jitter within these ranges. The location of the giant

86.6-GHz transitions is rare. Detection of maser emission from either of these
transitions therefore indicates the presence of special conditions, different
from those in the majority of methanol maser sources. We have observed temporal
variability in the 86.6-GHz emission towards 345.010+1.792, which along with
the very narrow line width, confirms that the emission is a maser in this

part of our analysis we consider 387 and 436 groups of HG and PG, respectively,
and compare morphology- (luminosity-) weighted to unweighted group properties:
velocity dispersion, mean pairwise distance, and mean groupcentric distance of
member galaxies. The second part of our analysis is based on two ensemble
systems, one for each catalog, built by suitably combining together galaxies of
all groups (1584 and 1882 galaxies for HG and PG groups, respectively). We find
that earlier-type (brighter) galaxies are more clustered and lie closer to the
group centers, both in position and in velocity, than later-type (fainter)
galaxies. Spatial segregations are stronger than kinematical segregations.
These effects are generally detected at the larger than 3-sigma level.
Luminosity segregation is shown to be independent of morphology segregation.
Our main conclusions are strengthened by the detection of segregation in both
hierarchical and percolation catalogs. Our results agree with a continuum of
segregation properties of galaxies in systems, from low-mass groups to massive
clusters.

radio-quiet, Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy IRAS 13224-3809 obtained during the
guaranteed time programme with a 64 ks exposure. The most remarkable spectral
feature is a sharp drop, by a factor ~5, in the spectrum at 8 keV. This is a
similar, but stronger, feature to that which we found in 1H0707-495.
Significant flattening of the hard X-ray spectrum occurs when the source flux
decreases. The flattening of the spectrum can be modelled as an increase in the
column density of the absorbing material and/or its covering fraction. Below ~
1.5 keV the spectrum is dominated by a giant soft X-ray excess, and at around ~
1.2 keV there is a significant absorption feature detected, most probably due
to ionized Fe L absorption. The new X-ray spectral properties detected with
XMM-Newton in IRAS 13224-3809 support a partial covering interpretation, i.e.
the presence of dense material inside the accretion-disc region partially
obscuring the emission from the accretion disc. However, the sharpness of the
feature, if due to photoelectric absorption, is surprising and may require an
alternative explanation. One possibility which does fit the whole spectrum is
that it is dominated by ionized reflection rather than absorption. The unusual
spectral properties detected with XMM-Newton from Narrow-Line Seyfert 1
galaxies increase the known spectral complexity of active galactic nuclei and
should further stimulate a combined theoretical and observational effort to
achieve a better understanding of the physics of the innermost regions of AGN.

galaxies of the Gonzalez (1993) sample, and compare the results with those
TFWG00 and Thomas et al (2003). Since very large differences are found, in
particular as far as the age is concerned, we analyze in a great detail all
possible sources of disagreement, going from the stellar models and SSPs to
many technical details of the procedure to calculate the indices, and finally
the pattern of chemical elements (especially when alpha-enhanced mixtures are
adopted). The key issue of the analysis is that at given metallicity Z and
enhancement factor, the specific abundance ratios [Xel/Fe] adopted for some
elements (e.g. O, Mg, Ti, and likely others) dominate the scene because with
the TB95 RFs they may strongly affect indices like Hb and the age in turn.
Finally we have drawn some remarks on the interpretation of the distribution of
early-type galaxies in popular two-indices planes, like Hb vs. [MgFe]. We argue
that part of the scatter along the Hb axis observed in this plane could be
attributed instead of the age, the current explanation, to a spread both in the
degree of enhancement and some abundance ratios. The main conclusion of this
study is that deriving ages, metallicities and degree of enhancement from line
indices is a cumbersome affair whose results are still uncertain.

heating in a steady-field demagnetized sample, is a common feature to the four
types of polycrystalline permanent magnets, mainly utilized for practical
purposes, i.e. barium ferrites, SmCo5, Sm2Co17 and NdFeB magnets. The effect is
small for pinning controlled and large for nucleation controlled magnets. The
effect is strongly dependent on the demagnetization factor and may reach nearly
100 per cent in SmCo5 samples measured in a closed circuit. The TR is very
sensitive to a small superimposed steady field. The maximum effect and the
position of the peak is dependent on the initial temperature. The direction of
the TR is correlated with the temperature coefficient of the coercivity,
resulting in a inverse TR in barium ferrite. The susceptibility of the
thermally remagnetized samples is increased. Repeated cycles of steady-field
demagnetization followed by heating result in the same TR. The phenomenology of
TR and ITR is explained by means of a model taking into account both the
internal field fluctuations due to grain interactions and the decay of single
domain grains into multi-domain state. By taking the measured temperature
dependencies of the coercivity and the saturation magnetization the theory is
able to reproduce the experiments very well, allowing to determine the width of
the field fluctuations, the width of the switching field distribution and an
internal demagnetization factor as characteristics of the materials by fitting.

are derived within the strong-coupling phonon-plasmon scheme that account for
the screened Coulomb interaction. Specifically, we calculate the

discuss the theory of finite supercurrent bilayer states, both in the presence

the microscopic mean-field equations exist at all condensate phase winding
rates for zero and sufficiently weak hybridization strengths. We find, however,
that collective instabilities occur when the supercurrent exceeds a critical
value determined primarily by a competition between direct and exchange
inter-layer Coulomb interactions. The critical current is estimated using a
local stability criterion and varies as $(d_c-d)^{1/2}$ when $d$ approaches
$d_c$ from below. For large inter-layer hybridization, we find that the
critical current is limited by a soliton instability of microscopic origin.

depend on whether the injected spin-polarized carriers are electrons or holes,

free-electron-like parabolic bands which are missing in the local basis. We

openness with respect to document and metadata formats, transmission protocols,
and filtering mechanisms. It specifies a high-level building kit, by which
arbitrary processors for document streams can be incorporated to support the
retrieval, transformation, aggregation and disaggregation of documents. Using
the same kit, interfaces for different transmission protocols can be added
easily to enable the communication with various information sources and
information consumers.

influenced by the metric, not, however, by the possible presence of a torsion
T. Still the light can feel torsion if the latter is coupled nonminimally to
the electromagnetic field F by means of a supplementary Lagrangian of the type
l^2 T^2 F^2 (l = coupling constant). Recently Preuss suggested a specific
nonminimal term of this nature. We evaluate the spacetime relation of Preuss in
the background of a general O(3)-symmetric torsion field and prove by
specifying the optical metric of spacetime that this can yield birefringence in

isotropic torsion field in a Friedmann cosmos affects the speed of light.

extrapolation of the cosmological expansion of the momenta of the modes of

  The mechanism is due to mode - reservoir interaction, whereupon virtual

condensate results. It has a massless and massy collective excitation, the
latter identified with the inflaton. For an effective non dimensional

space. The first equation in this series is the familiar Kinetic Equation for
the mean waveaction spectrum, whereas the second and higher equations describe
the fluctuations about this mean spectrum. The fluctuations exhibit a
nontrivial dynamics if some long coordinate-space correlations are present in
the system, as it is the case in typical numerical and laboratory experiments.
Without such long-range correlations, the fluctuations are trivially fixed at
their Gaussian values and cannot evolve even if the wavefield itself is
non-Gaussian in the coordinate space. Unlike the previous approaches based on
smooth initial k-space cumulants, the RPA model works even for extreme cases
where the k-space fluctuations are absent or very large and intermittent. We
show that any initial non-Gaussianity at small amplitudes propagates without
change toward the high amplitudes at each fixed wavenumber. At each fixed
amplitude, however, the PDF becomes Gaussian at large time.

advection-diffusion equation with the most general form of the inertial
nonlinearity. The statistics of the advecting velocity field is Gaussian with
powerlike energy spectrum and dispersion law. The inertial-range behavior of
the model is described by seven regimes that correspond to nontrivial fixed
points of the RG equations and exhibit anomalous scaling. The corresponding
anomalous exponents are associated with the critical dimensions of tensor
composite operators built solely of the passive vector field, which allows to
construct a regular perturbation expansion. The actual calculation is performed

space, we separate the Hilbert space into a low momentum and a high momentum
part. The renormalization group is used to construct the effective interaction
V_{low k} in the low momentum space, starting from various high precision
potential models commonly used in nuclear many-body calculations. With a cutoff
in the range of $\Lambda ~ 2.1 fm^{-1}$, the new potential V_{low k} is
independent of the input model, and reproduces the experimental phase shift
data for corresponding laboratory energies below $E_{lab} ~ 350 MeV$, as well
as the deuteron binding energy with similar accuracy as the realistic input
potentials. The model independence of V_{low k} demonstrates that the physics
of nucleons interacting at low momenta does not depend on details of the high
momentum dynamics assumed in conventional potential models. V_{low k} does not
have momentum components larger than the cutoff, and as a consequence is
considerably softer than the high precision potentials. Therefore, when V_{low
k} is used as microscopic input in the many-body problem, the high momentum
effects in the particle-particle channel do not have to be addressed by
performing a Brueckner ladder resummation or short-range correlation methods.
By varying the cutoff, we study how the model independence of V_{low k} is
reached in different partial waves. This provides numerical evidence for the
separation of scales in the nuclear problem, and physical insight into the
nature of the low momentum interaction.

and the computational time requirements: with respect to a simple forward

As an example, we discuss the solution of the final-value problem for a
Fokker-Planck equation whose drift velocity solves a different initial-value
problem -- a relevant issue in the context of turbulent scalar transport.

electrical signals. Two adaptation mechanisms are known to modify the ionic
current flowing through the transduction channels of the hair bundles: a rapid
process involves calcium ions binding to the channels; and a slower adaptation
is associated with the movement of myosin motors. We present a mathematical
model of the hair cell which demonstrates that the combination of these two
mechanisms can produce `self-tuned critical oscillations', i.e. maintain the
hair bundle at the threshold of an oscillatory instability. The characteristic
frequency depends on the geometry of the bundle and on the calcium dynamics,
but is independent of channel kinetics. Poised on the verge of vibrating, the
hair bundle acts as an active amplifier. However, if the hair cell is
sufficiently perturbed, other dynamical regimes can occur. These include slow
relaxation oscillations which resemble the hair bundle motion observed in some
experimental preparations.

Correlations for three successive local spin measurements on one particle are

the Bell inequality. In both cases, the mistaken assumption that the underlying
process is wide-sense-stationary in angle results in violation of Bell's
inequality. These results directly challenge the wide-spread belief that
violation of Bell's inequality is a decisive test for nonlocality.

protocols that are cryptanalyzed in this paper were proven secure with respect
to some eavesdropping approaches, and results reported here do not invalidate
these proofs. Rather, they suggest that quantum cryptographic protocols, like
conventional protocols, may be vulnerable to methods of attack that were not

affect local and non-local measures of system coherence. We find that the time

the proof that particle acceleration occurs in the intracluster medium. It is
often believed that shock surfaces associated with either mergers of clusters
of galaxies, or with the cosmological inflow of matter onto clusters during
structure formation may be the sites for acceleration. We discuss here the
effectiveness of shock acceleration in the intracluster medium, stressing that
merger related shocks are typically weak, at least for the so-called major
mergers. We investigate the implications of shock strengths for gamma ray
emission from single clusters of galaxies and for their detectability with
future gamma ray experiments such as GLAST. We also discuss the contribution of
clusters of galaxies to the extragalactic diffuse gamma ray background.

powered jets at a given frequency and the mass M of the central compact object.
For scale invariant jet models, the mathematical structure of the equations
describing the synchrotron emission from jets enables us to cancel out the
model dependent complications of jet dynamics, retaining only a simple, model
independent algebraic relation between F_{nu} and M. This approach allows us to
derive the F_{nu}-M relation for any accretion disk scenario that provides a
set of input boundary conditions for the magnetic field and the relativistic
particle pressure in the jet, such as standard and advection dominated
accretion flow (ADAF) disk solutions. Surprisingly, the mass dependence of
F_{nu} is very similar in different accretion scenarios. For typical
flat-spectrum core dominated radio jets and standard accretion scenarios we
find F_{nu}~M^{17/12}. The 7-9 orders of magnitude difference in black hole
mass between microquasars and AGN jets imply that AGN jets must be about 3-4
orders of magnitude more radio loud than microquasars, i.e., the ratio of radio
to bolometric luminosity is much smaller in microquasars than in AGN jets.
Because of the generality of these results, measurements of this F_{nu}-M
dependence are a powerful probe of jet and accretion physics. We show how our
analysis can be extended to derive a similar scaling relation between the
accretion rate mdot and F_{nu} for different accretion disk models. For
radiatively inefficient accretion modes we find that the flat spectrum emission
follows F_{nu}~(mdot*M)^{17/12}.

conserves because elastic scattering keeps the neutrino and antineutrino
distribution functions in the equilibrium form and the sum of their chemical
potential keeps zero even after the neutrino annihilation freeze-out. We also
simulate the evolution of the degenerate neutrino spectrum to support the
argument. We conclude that the change in the neutrino degeneracy parameter when

using the entropy conservation and the lepton number conservation without
worrying about at what temperature the neutrino annihilation process freezes

core-collapse events that result from isolated, massive stars with thick
hydrogen envelopes intact at the time of explosion. Their distances are now
routinely estimated through two techniques: the expanding photosphere method
(EPM), a primary distance-determining method, and the recently developed
standard-candle method (SCM), a promising secondary technique. Using Cycle 10
HST observations, we identify 41 Cepheid variable stars in NGC 1637, the host
galaxy of the most thoroughly studied SN II-P to date, SN 1999em. Remarkably,
the Cepheid distance that we derive to NGC 1637, D = 11.7 +/- 1.0 Mpc, is
nearly 50% larger than earlier EPM distance estimates to SN 1999em. This is the
first direct comparison between these two primary distance determining methods
for a galaxy hosting a well-observed, spectroscopically and photometrically
normal, SN II-P. Extensive consistency checks show strong evidence to support
the Cepheid distance scale, so we are led to believe that either SN 1999em is
in some heretofore unsuspected way an unusual SN II-P, or that the SN II-P
distance scale must be revised. Assuming the latter, this one calibration
yields H_0(EPM) = 57 +/- 15 km/s/Mpc and H_0(SCM) = 59 +/- 11 km/s/Mpc;
additional calibrating galaxies are clearly desirable in order to test the
robustness of both determinations of H_0. The HST observations of NGC 1637 also
captured the fading SN 1999em two years after explosion, providing the latest
photometry ever obtained for an SN II-P. Through comparison with photometry of
SN 1987A at similar epochs, we conclude that a slightly greater amount of
radioactive Ni-56, ~0.09 M_sun, was ejected by SN 1999em than was derived for
SN 1987A (0.075 M_sun).

galactic black holes with a total of ~50 simultaneous observations in the radio
and X-ray bands. Using this sample, we study the correlations between the radio
(L_{R}) and the X-ray (L_{X}) luminosity and the black hole mass (M). We find
that the radio luminosity is correlated with {\em both} M and L_{X}, at a
highly significant level. In particular, we show that the sources define a
``fundamental plane'' in the three-dimensional (log L_{R},log L_{X},log M)
space, given by log L_{R}=(0.60^{+0.11}_{-0.11}) log L_{X}
+(0.78^{+0.11}_{-0.09}) log M + 7.33^{+4.05}_{-4.07}, with a substantial
scatter of \sigma_{R}=0.88. We compare our results to the theoretical relations
between radio flux, black hole mass, and accretion rate derived by Heinz and
Sunyaev (2003). Such relations depend only on the assumed accretion model and
on the observed radio spectral index. Therefore, we are able to show that the
X-ray emission from black holes accreting at less than a few per cent of the
Eddington rate is unlikely to be produced by radiatively efficient accretion,
and is marginally consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission from the
jet. On the other hand, models for radiatively inefficient accretion flows seem
to agree well with the data.

variability with a period of 19.788+-0.002 min, which we suggest to be the
white dwarf spin period. The power spectrum of our photometry also contains a
strong signal near the spectroscopically determined orbital period. The
emission lines in 1RXSJ062518.2+733433 display a complex multicomponent

with a radial velocity semi-amplitude of ~140kms, consistent with a possible
origin on the irradiated face of the secondary. The absence of eclipses gives
an upper limit on the binary inclination of i<=60deg.

detect a strong signal for the whole sample (~6sigma) in the soft 0.5-2keV band
corresponding to a flux of ~7*10^-16cgs and a luminosity of ~2*10^40cgs. A
statistically significant signal is also detected for both the early and late
galaxy sub-samples with X-ray luminosities of ~3*10^40 and ~5*10^39cgs
respectively. In contrast, no signal is detected in the hard 2-8keV band for
any of the above samples. The mean L_X/L_B ratio of the spiral galaxy sample is
consistent with both local (<100Mpc) and distant (z~1) samples suggesting
little or no evolution of the X-ray emission mechanisms relative to the

is estimated to be 0.4% in broad agreement with the XRB fractions estimated in

three decades in temperature. Using the flux ratio CIII 1176/977 as
diagnostics, we investigate the dependence of the electron pressure of the
transition region as a function of the rotation period, age and magnetic
activity. The results from these solar proxies indicate that the electron
pressure of the stellar ~10^5-K plasma decreases by a factor of about 70
between the young, fast-rotating magnetically active star and the old,
slow-rotating inactive star. Also, the observations indicate that the average
surface fluxes of emission features strongly decrease with increasing stellar
age and longer rotation period. The emission flux evolution with age or
rotation period is well fitted by power laws, which become steeper from cooler
chromospheric (10^4 K) to hotter coronal (10^7 K) plasma. The relationship for
the integrated (920-1180 A) FUSE flux indicates that the solar far-ultraviolet
emissions were about twice the present value 2.5 Gyr ago and about 4 times the
present value 3.5 Gyr ago. Note also that the FUSE/FUV flux of the Zero-Age
Main Sequence Sun could have been higher by as much as 50 times. Our analysis
suggests that the strong FUV emissions of the young Sun may have played a
crucial role in the developing planetary system, in particular through the
photoionization, photochemical evolution and possible erosion of the planetary

multipole components lift the degeneracy of the molecular level in the same
way. Moreover the relative signs of the splittings turn out to be such that the
splittings add up when the external field induces charge into the respective

electronic structure is strongly modified. Therefore, in general, in C60
field-effect devices charge is not simply put into otherwise unchanged bands,
so already because of this their physics should be quite different from that of

asynchronous events. This new parity effect is fully confirmed by Monte Carlo
simulations on 1d lattices as well as for 2d and 3d lattices. In contrast, the
1d continuum approximation valid for sufficiently large lattices predicts a
monotonic increase of the efficiency as a function of $p$. The relevance of the
model for several research areas is briefly discussed.

emitted during the collapse of neutron stars and supermassive stars to black

  MODT001",,,,"hep-ex",,"  Reconstruction of one run of CLEO III raw data can take up to 9 days to
complete using a single processor. This is an administrative nightmare, and
even minor failures result in reprocessing the entire run, which wastes time,
money and CPU power. We leveraged the ability of the CLEO III software
infrastructure to read and write multiple file formats to perform
reconstruction of a single run using several CPUs in parallel. Using the Sun
Grid Engine and some Perl scripts, we assign roughly equal-sized chunks of
events to different CPUs. The Raw data are read from an Objectivity/DB
database, but the reconstruction output is written to a temporary file, not the
database. This takes about 6 hours. Once all the chunks have been analyzed,
they are gathered together in event-number order and injected into
Objectivity/DB. This process takes an additional 6 to 18 hours, depending on
run size. A web-based monitoring tool displays the status of reconstruction.
Many benefits accrue from this process, including a dramatic increase in
efficiency, a 20% increase in luminosity processed per week, more predictable
and manageable processor farm load, reduction in the time to stop the processor
farm from up to 9 days to less than 24 hours, superior fault tolerance, quicker
feedback and repair times for bugs in the reconstruction code, and faster
turn-around of early runs for data quality and software correctness checks.

solar luminosity (the `luminosity constraint'). Existing experiments show that
the p-p solar neutrino flux is 1.02 +- 0.02 (1 sigma) times the flux predicted
by the BP00 standard solar model; the 7Be neutrino flux is 0.93^{+0.25}_{-0.63}

parameters and solar neutrino fluxes, and to elucidate the transition from
vacuum-dominated to matter-dominated oscillations at low energies. A future 7Be
nu-e scattering experiment accurate to +- 10 % can reduce the uncertainty in
the experimentally determined 7Be neutrino flux by a factor of four and the
uncertainty in the p-p neutrino flux by a factor of 2.5 (to +- 0.8 %). A future
p-p experiment must be accurate to better than +- 3 % to shrink the uncertainty
in tan^2 theta_{12} by more than 15 %. The idea that the Sun shines because of
nuclear fusion reactions can be tested accurately by comparing the observed
photon luminosity of the Sun with the luminosity inferred from measurements of
solar neutrino fluxes. Based upon quantitative analyses of present and
simulated future experiments, we answer the question: Why perform low-energy

vector bundles whose spectral cover is reducible. Then we derive an explicit

transitions provided a certain vanishing argument applies. Such transitions
increase the holonomy of the heterotic vector bundle and cause gauge changing
phase transitions. In an M-theory description the transitions are associated
with collisions of bulk five-branes with one of the boundary fixed planes. In

seven-form is discussed in the presence of the five-brane anomaly-cancelling
term. It is shown that the supersymmetric completion of this term exists and it
is argued that it is the unique anomaly-cancelling invariant at this dimension
which is at least quartic in the fields. This implies that the first
deformation of the theory is completely determined by the anomaly term from
which one can, in principle, read off the corrections to all of the superspace
field strength tensors.

technique to solve initial-value problems involving nonlinear differential
equations. These methods seem particularly useful to the study of chaos since
no analytical chaotic solution is currently available. Using the well-known
Lorenz equations as an example, it is demonstrated that numerically computed
results and their associated statistical properties are time-step dependent.
There are two reasons for this behavior. First, chaotic differential equations
are unstable so that any small error is amplified exponentially near an
unstable manifold. The more serious and lesser-known reason is that stable and
unstable manifolds of singular points associated with differential equations
can form virtual separatrices. The existence of a virtual separatrix presents
the possibility of a computed trajectory actually jumping through it due to the
finite time-steps of discrete numerical methods. Such behavior violates the
uniqueness theory of differential equations and amplifies the numerical errors
explosively. These reasons imply that, even if computed results are bounded,
their independence on time-step should be established before accepting them as
useful numerical approximations to the true solution of the differential
equations. However, due to these exponential and explosive amplifications of
numerical errors, no computed chaotic solutions of differential equations
independent of integration-time step have been found. Thus, reports of computed
non-periodic solutions of chaotic differential equations are simply
consequences of unstably amplified truncation errors, and are not approximate
solutions of the associated differential equations.

scales, of the order of a hundred times the vortex rotation period, knots
simultaneously translate and precess with very little change of shape. However,
on long time scales we find that knots evolve in a more complicated manner,
with particular arcs expanding and contracting, producing substantial
variations in the total length. The topology of a knot is preserved during the
evolution and after several thousand vortex rotation periods the knot appears
to approach an asymptotic state. Furthermore, this asymptotic state is
dependent upon the initial conditions and suggests that, even within a given
topology, a host of meta-stable configurations exist, rather than a unique
stable solution. We discuss a possible mechanism for the observed evolution,
associated with the impact of higher frequency wavefronts emanating from parts
of the knot which are more twisted than the expanding arcs.

blocking effect etc., is used to calculate the total reaction cross section
$\sigma_R$ induced by $\alpha$-particles on different targets in the incident
energy range from 17.4 to 48.1 MeV/u. The calculation result can reproduce the
experimental data well. The nucleus-nucleus interaction radius parameter $r_0$
was extracted from experimental $\sigma_R$. It is found that $r_0$ becomes
constant with increasing the mass number of target.

$J/\psi$ production in deuterium-nucleus collisions. We discuss how the
shadowing and its spatial dependence may be measured by comparing central and
peripheral $dA$ collisions. These event classes may be selected by using gray
protons from heavy ion breakup and events where the proton or neutron in the
deuterium does not interact. We find that inhomogenous shadowing has a
significant effect on central $dA$ collisions, larger than is observed in
central $AA$ collisions. The inhomogeneity may be measured by comparing the
rapidity dependence of $J/\psi$ production in central and peripheral
collisions. Results are presented for $d$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$
GeV and $d$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 6.2$ TeV.

obvious corollary of their results is that the capacitors should radiate
directly even if the connecting wires are shrunk to zero length. That this is
so is shown here by a direct derivation of capacitor radiation using an
oscillating electric dipole radiator model for the capacitors as well as the
alternative less widely known magnetic 'charge' current loop representation for

  and for Empirical Evidence Usually Interpreted as Dark Matter",,,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  According to modern quantum physics, at the microlevel, the dimension of
space-time is at least 11; we only observe 4 dimensions because the others are
compactified: the size along each of the other dimensions is much smaller than
the macroscale. There is no universally accepted explanation of why exactly 4
dimensions remain at the microscopic level. A natural suggestion is: maybe
there is no fundamental reason why exactly 4 dimensions should remain, maybe
when we go to even larger scales, some of the 4 dimensions will be compactified
as well? In this paper, we explore the consequences of the compactification
suggestion, and we show that -- on the qualitative level -- these consequences
have actually been already observed: as superclusters and as evidence that is
usually interpreted as justifying dark matter. Thus, we get a new possible
explanation of both superclusters and dark matter evidence -- via dimension
compactification.

velocity and the particle transport velocity are functions of position, with
the strongest variation being in the focal region. These velocities are
everywhere parallel to each other, and their product is constant in space. For
a coherent monochromatic electromagnetic beam, the energy transport velocity is
never greater than the speed of light, and can even be zero. The phase
velocities (one each for the non-zero components of the electric and magnetic
fields, in general) can be different from each other and from the energy
transport velocity, both in direction and in magnitude. The phase velocities at
a given point are independent of time, for both particle and electromagnetic
beams. The energy velocity is independent of time for the particle beam, but in
general oscillates (with angular frequency 2w) in magnitude and direction about
its mean value at a given point in the electromagnetic beam. However, there
exist electromagnetic steady beams, within which the energy flux, energy
density and energy velocity are all independent of time.

Neither do beams which are everywhere circularly polarized in a fixed plane. It
is also shown that transversely finite beams cannot be purely transverse in

travels at less than c. The electric and magnetic fields in an electromagnetic
beam have different polarization properties in general, but there exists a

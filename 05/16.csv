extinction curves in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) with
our understanding of the general behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. The
R_V dependent CCM relationship and the sample of extinction curves used to
derive this relationship is used to describe the general behavior of Milky Way
extinction curves. The ultraviolet portion of the SMC and LMC extinction curves
are derived from archival IUE data, except for one new SMC extinction curve
which was measured using HST/STIS observations. The optical extinction curves
are derived from new (for the SMC) and literature UBVRI photometry (for the
LMC). The near-infrared extinction curves are calculated mainly from 2MASS
photometry supplemented with DENIS and new JHK photometry. For each extinction
curve, we give R_V = A(V)/E(B-V) and N(HI) values which probe the same dust
column as the extinction curve. We compare the properties of the SMC and LMC
extinction curves with the CCM relationship three different ways: each curve by
itself, the behavior of extinction at different wavelengths with R_V, and
behavior of the extinction curve FM fit parameters with R_V. As has been found
previously, we find that a small number of LMC extinction curves are consistent
with the CCM relationship, but majority of the LMC and all of the SMC curves do
not follow the CCM relationship. For the first time, we find that the CCM
relationship seems to form a bound on the properties of all of the LMC and SMC
extinction curves. This result strengthens the picture of dust extinction
curves exhibit a continuum of properties between those found in the Milky Way
and the SMC Bar. (abridged)

E(B-V)=0.055 +/-0.005 based on recent spectral fits of the emission of the Vela

spectrum is different from the positive slope observed over a wide optical
range in the young Crab pulsar spectrum. The near-infrared part of the Vela
spectrum appears to have the same slope as the phase-averaged spectrum in the
high energy X-ray tail, obtained in the 2-10 keV range with the RXTE. Both of
these spectra can be fitted with a single power law suggesting their common
origin. Because the phase-averaged RXTE spectrum in this range is dominated by
the second X-ray peak of the pulsar light curve, coinciding with the second
main peak of its optical pulse profile, we suggest that this optical peak can
be redder than the first one. We also detect two faint extended structures in
the 1.5''-3.1'' vicinity of the pulsar, projected on and aligned with the

high-redshift galaxies in the fields of the BRI1346-0322 and Q2138-4427. These
QSOs have intervening absorbers, at redshifts z=2.85 and z=3.15 respectively,
for which redshifted Ly-alpha emission falls within less than a few AA from the
central wavelengths of existing VLT (~60 AA wide) narrow-band filters. We
selected 37 and 27 candidate emission-line galaxies in the two fields
respectively. About 85% of the candidates have R-band magnitudes fainter than
R=25.5. The first spectroscopic follow-up of a sub-sample of the candidates
resulted in 41 confirmed candidates and 4 foreground galaxies (three [OII]
emitters and one CIV emitter). The confirmation rate is 82% and 68% in the
field of BRI1346-0322 and Q2138-4427 respectively. In addition, we
serendipitously detect a number of other emission-line sources on some of the
slitlets not used for candidates. Of these, 9 are also most likely Ly-alpha
emitters with redshifts ranging from 1.98 to 3.47. The redshift distribution of
confirmed candidates in the field of BRI1346-0322 is consistent with being
drawn from a uniform distribution weighted by the filter response curve,
whereas the galaxies in the field of Q2138-4427 have redshifts clustering very
close to the redshift of the damped Ly-alpha absorber. This latter fact
indicates the existence of a large `pancake'-like structure confirming the

central to the behavior of the growth of large scale structure, offering the

with a time varying equation of state can have an influence on structure
formation stretching back well into the matter dominated epoch. We analyze this
impact, first calculating the linear perturbation results, including those for
weak gravitational lensing. These dynamical models possess definite observable
differences from constant equation of state models. Then we present a large

case where this intersection point is located at the Light Cylinder. We find
that in this case the separatrix equilibrium condition implies that all the
poloidal current must return to the pulsar in the open-field region, i.e., that
there should be no finite current carried by the separatrix/equator current
sheet. We then perform an asymptotic analysis of the pulsar equation near the
intersection point and find a unique self-similar solution; however, a Light
Surface inevitably emerges right outside the Light Cylinder. We then perform a
similar analysis for the situation where the intersection point lies somewhere
inside the Light Cylinder, in which case a finite current flowing along the
separatrix and the equator is allowed. We find a very simple behavior in this
case, characterized by a 90-degree angle between the separatrix and the equator

sample of 69 hosts of radio quasars, covering a redshift range between 0<z<3.
  The host galaxies are large (r_e}~15kpc) and luminous elliptical galaxies
(~75% of them brighter than L_*), with an evolution similar to that of radio
galaxies. A significant fraction (~40%) of them shows evidence of a possible
collision/merging process. They follow a mu_e-r_e relation similar to that of
normal elliptical galaxies. The morphological and photometric similarities
between these galaxies and radio galaxies in this wide range of redshifts is a
good test of the reliability of unification schemes. All of them show little
evolution from z=3 to the present epoch. Their K-z distribution is consistent
with a no-evolution model, with a fraction of the dispersion due to differences
in radio power. We have found a correlation between the quasar radio power and

disk were analytically investigated. We took the external UV radiation field,
the gravitational potential, and the observed gas temperature into account. The
model includes a description of the properties of individual gas clumps on
small scales, and a treatment of the circumnuclear disk as a quasi-continuous
accretion disk on large scales. In a second step the dynamics of an isolated
circumnuclear disk were investigated with the help of a collisional N-body
code. The environment of the disk is taken into account in a third step, where
we calculated a pro- and a retrograde encounter of an infalling gas cloud with
a pre-existing circumnuclear disk. In order to constrain the dynamical model,
we used the NIR absorption of the giant molecular clouds located within the
inner 50 pc of the Galaxy to reconstruct their line-of-sight distribution.

  In this paper, we argue that there is a new possibility in measurements of
time delays between multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars;
constrain the locations of putative flares that give rise to the intrinsic
rapid variabilities of quasars. The realization, however, of these goals cannot
be presently achieved due to the limited accuracy of the current measurements.
We predict that timing flares with accuracies of the order of a few seconds
will be needed to probe the location of the flares. Our proposing method will
work with better instruments in near future, such as XEUS.

1.4-GHz luminosities as indicators of star-formation rate and we have compared
the results obtained in these three bands. While 1.4-GHz and 15-micron
estimates are in good agreement, showing that our galaxies are forming stars at
a median rate of ~40 Mo/yr, the raw H_alpha-based estimates are a factor ~5-10
lower and need a mean correction of ~2 mag to be brought on the same scale as
the other two indicators. A correction of ~2 mag is consistent with what
suggested by the Balmer decrements H_alpha/H_beta and by the optical colours.

accretion rate of a halo is defined to be the rate of its mass increase due to
minor mergers. The accreted mass is deposited at the outer shells without
changing the density profile of the halo inside its current virial radius. We
applied the method to a flat $\Lambda CDM$ Universe. The resulting density
profiles are compared to analytical models proposed in the literature, and a
very good agreement is found. A trend is found of the inner density profile
becoming steeper for larger halo mass, that also results from recent N-body

found: the Markarian galaxies are generally undetected at 12$\mu$m and 25$\mu$m

and suggests that the youngest star forming regions dominating these galaxies
are relatively free of dust.
  The FIR selection criteria for the PDS is shown to introduce a strong bias
towards massive (luminous) and large size late-type spiral galaxies. This is
contrary to the Markarian galaxies, which are found to be remarkably rich in

measured outside of the Milky Way from a sample of red giants in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC), as well the Galactic globular cluster Omega Centauri.
The fluorine abundances are derived from vibration-rotation transitions of HF
using infrared spectra obtained with the Phoenix spectrograph on the Gemini
South 8.1m telescope. It is found that the abundance ratio of F/O declines as
the oxygen abundance decreases. The values of F/O are especially low in the two
Omega Cen giants; this very low value of F/O probably indicates that 19F
synthesis in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is not the dominant source of
fluorine in stellar populations. The observed decline in F/O with lower O
abundances is in qualitative agreement with what is expected if 19F is produced
via H- and He-burning sequences in very massive stars, with this fluorine then
ejected in high mass-loss rate Wolf-Rayet winds. A quantitative comparison of
observations with this process awaits results from more detailed chemical
evolution models incorporating the yields from Wolf-Rayet winds. Perhaps of
more significance is the quantitative agreement between the Galactic and LMC
results with predictions from models in which 19F is produced from neutrino
nucleosynthesis during core collpase in supernovae of Type II. The very low
values of F/O in Omega Cen are also in agreement with neutrino nucleosynthesis
models if the ``peculiar'' star formation history of Omega Cen, with 2-4
distinct episodes of star formation, is considered.

to SMC-like dust reddening rather than synchrotron emission. The color
distribution suggests that the population of moderately dust reddened
broad-line quasars is smaller than that of unobscured quasars, but we estimate
that a further 10% of the luminous quasar population is missing from the SDSS
sample because of dust extinction with E(B-V)<0.5. We also investigate the
emission and absorption line properties of these quasars as a function of color
with regard to Boroson & Green type eigenvectors. Intrinsically red (optically
steep) quasars tend to have narrower Balmer lines and weaker CIV, CIII], HeII
and 3000A bump emission as compared with bluer (optically flatter) quasars. The
change in strength of the 3000A bump appears to be dominated by the Balmer
continuum and not by FeII emission. The dust reddened quasars have even
narrower Balmer lines and weaker 3000A bumps, in addition to having
considerably larger equivalent widths of [OII] and [OIII] emission. The
fraction of broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs) increases from ~3.4% for
the bluest quasars to perhaps as large as 20% for the dust reddened quasars,

to the single impurity case, a systematic study of the modulations in the
two-impurity local density of states can distinguish between the DSC or DDW

preformed pairs or DDW order. Furthermore, in the DSC state the study of the

scattering model versus more strongly correlated models.

paper presents a new algorithm with lower computational complexity for
Dempster's rule than that of step-by-step application of Dempster's rule. In
this problem, every original pair of evidences, has a corresponding evidence
against the simultaneous belief in both propositions. In this case, it is
uncertain whether the propositions of any two evidences are in logical
conflict. The original evidences are associated with the vertices and the
additional evidences are associated with the edges. The original evidences are
ordered, i.e., for every pair of evidences it is determinable which of the two
evidences is the earlier one. We are interested in finding the most probable
completely specified path through the graph, where transitions are possible
only from lower- to higher-ranked vertices. The path is here a representation
for a sequence of states, for instance a sequence of snapshots of a physical
object's track. A completely specified path means that the path includes no
other vertices than those stated in the path representation, as opposed to an
incompletely specified path that may also include other vertices than those
stated. In a hierarchical network of all subsets of the frame, i.e., of all
incompletely specified paths, the original and additional evidences support
subsets that are not disjoint, thus it is not possible to prune the network to
a tree. Instead of propagating belief, the new algorithm reasons about the
logical conditions of a completely specified path through the graph. The new
algorithm is O(|THETA| log |THETA|), compared to O(|THETA| ** log |THETA|) of
the classic brute force algorithm.

Dempster-Shafer theory (Decision analysis using belief functions, Intern. J.
Approx. Reason. 4(5/6), 391-417, 1990). In this apparatus, expected utility
intervals are constructed for different choices. The choice with the highest
expected utility is preferable to others. However, to find the preferred choice
when the expected utility interval of one choice is included in that of
another, it is necessary to interpolate a discerning point in the intervals.
This is done by the parameter rho, defined as the probability that the
ambiguity about the utility of every nonsingleton focal element will turn out
as favorable as possible. If there are several different decision makers, we
might sometimes be more interested in having the highest expected utility among
the decision makers rather than only trying to maximize our own expected
utility regardless of choices made by other decision makers. The preference of
each choice is then determined by the probability of yielding the highest
expected utility. This probability is equal to the maximal interval length of
rho under which an alternative is preferred. We must here take into account not
only the choices already made by other decision makers but also the rational
choices we can assume to be made by later decision makers. In Strats apparatus,
an assumption, unwarranted by the evidence at hand, has to be made about the
value of rho. We demonstrate that no such assumption is necessary. It is
sufficient to assume a uniform probability distribution for rho to be able to
discern the most preferable choice. We discuss when this approach is
justifiable.

proposition giving support against the entire partitioning. In this article we
extend the results of the previous article. We will not only find the most

appears to encounter dynamical problems in practice. More subtly, one can avoid
the need for any actual physical motion (and avoid the dynamical problems) by
instead adjusting the propagation speed of the excitations of the analogue

  March 22-29, 2003",,,,"hep-ph nucl-th",,"  The behavior of the pion dispersion relation in a pion medium is strongly
modified by the introduction of a finite chemical potential associated to the
finite pion number density. Such behavior is particularly important during the
hadronic phase of a relativistic heavy-ion collision, between chemical and
thermal freeze-out, where the pion number changing processes, driven by the
strong interaction, can be considered to be frozen. We make use of an effective
Lagrangian that explicitly respects chiral symmetry through the enforcement of
the chiral Ward identities. The pion dispersion relation is computed through
the computation of the pion self-energy in a non-perturbative fashion by giving
an approximate solution to the Schwinger-Dyson equation for this self-energy.
Given the strong coupling between rho vectors and pions, we argue that the
modification of the pion mass due to finite pion density effects has to be
taken into account self-consistently for the description of the in-medium
modifications of rho's. We finally study some possible consequences of finite
pion density effects for the low-mass dilepton spectrum produced in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

model respectively the spin s=1/2 Heisenberg chain at roots of unity q^N=1 are
investigated. Two conjectures are formulated both of which are proven for N=3
and are verified numerically for several examples with N>3. The first
conjecture identifies an abelian subset of auxiliary matrices whose eigenvalues
are polynomials in the spectral variable. The zeroes of these polynomials are
shown to fall into two sets. One consists of the solutions to the Bethe ansatz
equations which determine the eigenvalues of the six-vertex transfer matrix.
The other set of zeroes contains the complete strings which encode the
information on the degeneracies of the model due to the loop symmetry sl_2
present at roots of 1. The second conjecture then states a polynomial identity
which relates the complete string centres to the Bethe roots allowing one to
determine the dimension of the degenerate eigenspaces. Its proof for N=3
involves the derivation of a new functional equation for the auxiliary matrices
and the six-vertex transfer matrix. Moreover, it is demonstrated in several
explicit examples that the complete strings coincide with the classical
analogue of the Drinfeld polynomial. The latter is used to classify the
finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the loop algebra sl_2. This
suggests that the constructed auxiliary matrices not only enable one to solve
the six-vertex model but also completely characterize the decomposition of its
eigenspaces into irreducible representations of the underlying loop symmetry.

to conjugation) in one-to-one correspondence with K-rational points of X. The
birational variant conjectures a similar correspondence where the fundamental
group is replaced by the absolute Galois group of the function field K(X).
  The present paper proves the birational section conjecture for all X when K

number of stable sets of cardinality k in graph G, then it is called the
independence polynomial of G (Gutman and Harary, 1983). A graph G is very
well-covered (Favaron, 1982) if it has no isolated vertices, its order equals
2*alpha(G), where alpha(G) is the size of a maximum stable set, and it is
well-covered (i.e., all its maximal independent sets are of the same size,
Plummer, 1970). For instance, appending a single pendant edge to each vertex of
G yields a very well-covered graph, which we denote by G*. Under certain
conditions, any well-covered graph equals G* for some G (Finbow, Hartnell and
Nowakowski, 1993). The root of the smallest modulus of the independence
polynomial of any graph is real (Brown, Dilcher, and Nowakowski, 2000). The
location of the roots of the independence polynomial in the complex plane, and
the multiplicity of the root of the smallest modulus are investigated in a
number of articles. In this paper we establish formulae connecting the
coefficients of I(G;x) and I(G*;x), which allow us to show that the number of
roots of I(G;x) is equal to the number of roots of I(G*;x) different from -1,
which appears as a root of multiplicity alpha(G*)- alpha(G) for I(G*;x). We
also prove that the real roots of I(G*;x) are in [-1,-1/(2*alpha(G*)), while
for a general graph of order n we show that its roots lie in |z| > 1/(2n-1).
Using the properties of the roots of the independence polynomial, we
demonstrate that the independence polynomial distinguishes well-covered spiders
(well-covered trees with at most one vertex of degree greater than two) among

by comparing the calculated and experimental isotope shift for the alkali and

long as 17 days and can be explained by the so-called condensation mechanism of
an interaction of the cosmic rays with the atmosphere.

Revised version",,,,"physics.class-ph cond-mat.mes-hall physics.gen-ph",,"  The validity of the Second Law of thermodynamics, indisputable in the
macroscopic world, is challenged at the mesoscopic level: a mesoscopic isolated
system, possessing spatial dimensions of the order of a few microns, is
capable, as shown by a straightforward kinetic analysis, to exhibit a perpetuum
mobile behavior associated with large negative variations of the Clausius
entropy of the system. This violation of the Second Law is expedient for
devising a cyclic process through which an isolated system can extract energy
from a surrounding thermal bath.

QCMA the verifier is a quantum program and the proof is classical. In contrast,
in QMA the proof is also a quantum state.
  We show that two known QMA-complete problems can be modified to QCMA-complete
problems in a natural way:
  (1) Deciding whether a 3-local Hamiltonian has low energy states (with energy
smaller than a given value) that can be prepared with at most k elementary
gates is QCMA-complete, whereas it is QMA-complete when the restriction on the
complexity of preparation is dropped.
  (2) Deciding whether a (classically described) quantum circuit acts almost as
the identity on all basis states is QCMA-complete. It is QMA-complete to decide
whether it acts on all states almost as the identity.

of a given quantum state $\rho$ with maximally entangled states. For a system
of $m$ particles, each with $N$ distinct states, we prove that $\rho$ is
$m$-particle negative partial transpose (NPT) entangled, if there exists a
maximally entangled state $|{\rm MES}>$, such that $<{\rm MES}|\rho|{\rm
MES}>>{1}/{N}$. While this sufficiency condition is weaker than the
Peres-Horodecki criterion in all cases, it applies to multi-particle systems,
and becomes especially useful when the number of particles ($m$) is large. We
also consider the converse of this criterion and illustrate its invalidity with
counter examples.

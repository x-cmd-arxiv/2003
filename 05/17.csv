of a black hole and a normal neutron star, and a black hole and a self-bound
strange quark matter star. In both cases inspiral continues until the Roche
limit is reached, at which point it is expected that stable mass transfer to
the balck hole ensues. Whereas a neutron star would then outspiral, the strange
quark matter star barely moves out at all. Eventually, the strange quark star
loses all its mass to the black hole, as compared to the neutron star whose
outspiral continues until stable mass transfer terminates and inspiral resumes.
These scenarios result in distinctly different gravitational wave signatures.

continue to maintain a floor in metallicity of ~1/700 solar independent of

primordial gas in high redshift galaxies and stresses the correspondence
between damped systems and star formation (i.e. galaxy formation). This floor
is significantly offset from the metallicity of the Lya forest and therefore we
consider it to be more related to active star formation within these galaxies
than scenarios of enrichment in the very early universe. Finally, we comment on
an apparent 'missing metals problem': the mean metallicity of the damped

the alpha Per targets. Three of the binaries have proper motions consistent
with cluster membership in the Pleiades cluster, and for one of them we report
the detection of Halpha in emission and LiI absorption obtained from

consistent with an extension to substellar masses of a trend observed among
stellar binaries: the maximum semimajor axis of binary systems decreases with
decreasing primary mass. We find a binary frequency of 2 binaries over 13 BDs
with confirmed proper motion membership in the Pleiades, corresponding to a
binary fraction of 15%(1 sigma error bar +15%/-5%). These binaries are limited
to the separation range 7-12~AU and their mass ratios are larger than 0.7. The

wide range of initial cloud parameters, the $m=2$ mode grows nonlinearly into a
bar during the isothermal collapse after the supercritical core formation. The
supercritical core can break up into fragments during or after the isothermal
phase of cloud evolution. The outcome of fragmentation depends on the initial
cloud conditions, such as the magnetic field strength, rotation rate, amount of
cloud mass and mass distribution. It is classified into three different types:
(1) separate core formation, (2) bar fragmentation, and (3) disk fragmentation.

classification of embedded binary and multiple systems of Looney, Mundy, &
Welch, based on millimeter dust continuum observations. The well-studied
starless core, L1544, appears to belong to the bar fragmentation type. We

interactions of phonon and nonphonon mechanisms in addition to the direct
Coulomb interaction. The interaction mediated by the spin fluctuations is
discussed as an example of the nonphonon interaction. Extended formulas for the
transition temperature Tc and the isotope-effect coefficient alpha are derived
for cases (a) omega_np < omega_D and (b) omega_np > omega_D, where omega_np is
an effective cutoff frequency of the nonphonon interaction that corresponds to
the Debye frequency omega_D in the phonon interaction. In case (a), it is found
that the nonphonon interaction does not change the condition for the inverse
isotope effect, i.e., mu^* > lambda_ph/2, but it modifies the magnitude of
alpha markedly. In particular, it is found that a giant isotope shift occurs
when the phonon and nonphonon interactions cancel each other largely. For
instance, strong critical spin fluctuations may give rise to the giant isotope
effect. In case (b), it is found that the inverse isotope effect occurs only
when the nonphonon interaction and the repulsive Coulomb interaction, in total
effect, work as repulsive interactions against the superconductivity. We
discuss the relevance of the present result to some organic superconductors,

the limit of strong easy-axis exchange anisotropy. We find, using only standard
techniques of degenerate perturbation theory, that the model has a U(1) gauge
symmetry generated by certain local rotations about the z-axis in spin space.
Upon addition of an extra local interaction in this and a related model with
spins on a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing octahedra, we can write
down the exact ground state wavefunction with no further approximations. Using
the properties of the soluble point we show that these models enter the U(1)
spin liquid phase, a novel fractionalized spin liquid with an emergent U(1)
gauge structure. This phase supports gapped S^z = 1/2 spinons carrying the U(1)
``electric'' gauge charge, a gapped topological point defect or ``magnetic''
monopole, and a gapless ``photon,'' which in spin language is a gapless,
linearly dispersing S^z = 0 collective mode. There are power-law spin
correlations with a nontrivial angular dependence, as well as novel U(1)
topological order. This state is stable to ALL zero-temperature perturbations
and exists over a finite extent of the phase diagram. Using a convenient
lattice version of electric-magnetic duality, we develop the effective
description of the U(1) spin liquid and the adjacent soluble point in terms of
Gaussian quantum electrodynamics and calculate a few of the universal
properties. The resulting picture is confirmed by our numerical analysis of the
soluble point wavefunction. Finally, we briefly discuss the prospects for
understanding this physics in a wider range of models and for making contact
with experiments.

of the S-wave fit, the peak mass is below 2m_p at M=1859 +3 -10(stat) +5 -25

It has been recently observed that, when the gauge fields propagate in the
bulk, unification of the gauge couplings may be achieved. Moreover, the
propagation of fermions in the bulk allows for a simple solution to potentially
dangerous proton decay problems. However, bulk gauge fields and fermions pose a
phenomenological challenge, since they tend to induce large corrections to the
precision electroweak observables. In this article, we study in detail the
effect of gauge and fermion fields propagating in the bulk in the presence of
gauge brane kinetic terms compatible with gauge coupling unification, and we
present ways of obtaining a consistent description of experimental data, while
allowing values of the first Kaluza Klein mode masses of the order of a few

massless fields associated with p-p' strings should transform in the

reduced to a single 2nd-order wave equation in a two-dimensional static
spacetime for a gauge-invariant master variable, irrespective of the mode of
perturbations. Our formulation applies to the case of vanishing as well as
non-vanishing cosmological constant Lambda. The sign of the sectional curvature
K of each spatial section of equipotential surfaces is also kept general. In
the four-dimensional Schwarzschild background, this master equation for a
scalar perturbation is identical to the Zerilli equation for the polar mode and
the master equation for a vector perturbation is identical to the Regge-Wheeler
equation for the axial mode. Furthermore, in the four-dimensional
Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter background with K=0,1, our equation coincides with
those derived by Cardoso and Lemos recently. As a simple application, we prove
the perturbative stability and uniqueness of four-dimensional non-extremal
spherically symmetric black holes for any Lambda. We also point out that there
exists no simple relation between scalar-type and vector-type perturbations in
higher dimensions, unlike in four dimensions. Although we only treat maximally
symmetric black holes in the present paper, the final master equations are
valid even when the hirozon geometry is described by a generic Einstein

from the time-of-flight of laser cooled and launched cesium atoms traveling
through an electric field. We find alpha_0 = 6.611+-0.009 x 10^-39 C m^2/V=
59.42+-0.08 x 10^-24 cm^3 = 401.0+-0.6 a_0^3. The 0.14% uncertainty is a factor
of fourteen improvement over the previous measurement. Values for the 6P_1/2
and 6P_3/2 lifetimes and the 6S_1/2 cesium-cesium dispersion coefficient C_6
are determined from alpha_0 using the procedure of Derevianko and Porsev [Phys.
Rev. A 65, 053403 (2002)].

consider reference frames defined by linear and quadratic gauge conditions. In
both cases we discuss their Gribov ambiguities and commutator algebra. We
construct the momentum operators, inner-product and Hamiltonian in both types
of gauges, for systems with and without translation invariance. The analogy
with the quantization of QED in non-covariant gauges is emphasized. Our results
are applied to quasi-rigid systems in the Eckart frame.

function on pure states. We find that this function can be interpreted as a
physical quantity related to the average purity of the constituent qubits and
show how it can be observed in an efficient manner without the need for full
quantum state tomography. A possible realization is described for measuring the
entanglement of a chain of atomic qubits trapped in a 3D optical lattice.

  published by Nova Science; 26 pages",,,"SAASP 030512","quant-ph",,"  The question of what ontological message (if any) is encoded in the formalism
of contemporary physics is, to say the least, controversial. The reasons for
this state of affairs are psychological and neurobiological. The processes by
which the visual world is constructed by our minds, predispose us towards
concepts of space, time, and substance that are inconsistent with the
spatiotemporal and substantial aspects of the quantum world. In the first part
of this chapter, the latter are extracted from the quantum formalism. The
nature of a world that is fundamentally and irreducibly described by a
probability algorithm is determined. The neurobiological processes responsible
for the mismatch between our ""natural"" concepts of space, time, and substance
and the corresponding aspects of the quantum world are discussed in the second
part. These natural concepts give rise to pseudoproblems that foil our attempts
to make ontological sense of quantum mechanics. If certain psychologically
motivated but physically unwarranted assumptions are discarded (in particular
our dogged insistence on obtruding upon the quantum world the intrinsically and
completely differentiated spatiotemporal background of classical physics), we
are in a position to see why our fundamental physical theory is a probability
algorithm, and to solve the remaining interpretational problems.

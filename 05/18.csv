observations, taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble
Space Telescope, are the deepest optical images yet obtained, attaining 50%
completeness at V = 30.7 mag. The CMD, constructed from approximately 300,000
stars, reaches more than 1.5 mag fainter than the old main-sequence turnoff.
Our analysis is based on direct comparisons to ACS observations of four
globular clusters through the same filters, as well as chi-squared fitting to a
finely-spaced grid of calibrated stellar-population models. We find that the
M31 halo contains a major (approximately 30% by mass) intermediate-age (6-8
Gyr) metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -0.5) population, as well as a significant
globular-cluster age (11-13.5 Gyr) metal-poor population. These findings
support the idea that galaxy mergers played an important role in the formation
of the M31 halo.

method to implement an algorithm that allows us to get an explicit formula for
$M_{m,n}$ for given $m$.

"math/0305256","W. Ethan Duckworth","W. Ethan Duckworth","Infiniteness of Double Coset Collections in Algebraic Groups","24 pages",,,,"math.GR",,"  Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed
field. The double coset question addressed in this paper is the following:
Given closed subgroups $X$ and $P$, is the double coset collection $X\backslash
G/P$ finite or infinite? We limit ourselves to the case where $X$ is maximal
rank and reductive and $P$ parabolic. This paper presents a criterion for
infiniteness which involves only dimensions of centralizers of semisimple
elements. This result is then applied to finish the classification of those $X$
which are spherical. Finally, excluding a case in $F_4$, we show that if
$X\backslash G/P$ is finite then $X$ is spherical or the Levi factor of $P$ is
spherical. This implies that it is rare for $X\backslash G/P$ to be finite. The
primary method of proof is to descend to calculations at the finite group level
and then to use elementary character theory.

two talks per week for four weeks.
  The first talk each week was concerned with constructing embeddings of finite
groups, especially $\PSL_2(p)$ and $\PGL_2(p)$, into Lie groups. The second
talk each week was about generalizations of the notion of complete reducibility
in group theory, especially in positive characteristic.

lecture series. At the end of the notes, there is a short list of references as

holomorphically trivial vector bundle. We see that Hain's result and ours
follow from a careful study of Simpson's correspondence between Higgs bundles

These data extend the range of previous studies of HBT radii by a factor of two

microscopic models that include hadronic rescattering and transverse expansion.
We also report new data on pion correlations. The two particle correlations of
negative pions at a transverse mass of 0.92 GeV imply source radii that are
smaller than typical hydrodynamic fits and transport model simulations. It is
possible that these fast pions may have left the source before the build up of
hydrodynamic flow.

denser initial parton system than estimated from perturbative QCD.
Hadronization via parton coalescence can resolve this ``opacity puzzle''
because it enhances hadron elliptic flow at large pT relative to that of
partons at the same transverse momentum. An experimentally testable consequence
of the coalescence scenario is that v2(pT) saturates at about 50% higher values
for baryons than for mesons. In addition, if strange quarks have weaker flow
than light quarks, hadron v2 at high pT decreases with relative strangeness
content.

{TMC-1} through its transition $2_{1 2} \to 1_{1 1}$ at 91.5 GHz. Mangum and
Wootten (1990) detected $c$-C$_3$H through the transition $1_{1 0} \to 1_{1 1}$
at 14.8 GHz in 12 additional galactic objects. The column density of $c$-C$_3$H
in the objects was estimated to be about one order of magnitude lower than that
of the C$_3$H$_2$ which is ubiquitous in the galactic objects. The most
probable production mechanism of both the C$_3$H and C$_3$H$_2$ in dark clouds
is a common dissociation reaction of C$_3$H$_3^+$ ion (Adams & Smith, 1987).
Although the $c$-C$_3$H is 0.8 eV less stable than its isomer $l$-C$_3$H,
finding of comparable column densities of both the isomers in {TMC-1} supports
the idea of comparable formation of both the $c$-C$_3$H and $l$-C$_3$H in the
cosmic objects. Existence of a metaisomer in interstellar condition is a well
known phenomenon in astronomy.
  We propose that $c$-C$_3$H may be identified through the transition $3_{3 1}
\to 3_{3 0}$ at 3.4 GHz in absorption against the cosmic 2.7 K background in
dense cosmic objects when no strong source is present in the background. When
there is some strong source in the background of the object, peak of the
absorption line decreases with the increase of the strength of the background
source. However, at low densities, the intensity is found to increase. Hence,
in low density regions, a background source can help in detection of the line.
This absorption line may play an important role for identification of
$c$-C$_3$H in a large number of cosmic objects. Similar absorption features are
found for $c$-C$_3$D radical also.

a.s.l., 3100 m w.e. of minimum rock overburden, 920 m**2 effective area) at the

(Ne) measured by EAS-TOP and the muon number (Nmu) recorded by MACRO. The two
detectors are separated on average by 1200 m of rock, and located at a
respective zenith angle of about 30 degrees. The energy threshold at the
surface for muons reaching the MACRO depth is approximately 1.3 TeV. Such muons
are produced in the early stages of the shower development and in a kinematic
region quite different from the one relevant for the usual Nmu-Ne studies. The
measurement leads to a primary composition becoming heavier at the knee of the
primary spectrum, the knee itself resulting from the steepening of the spectrum
of a primary light component (p, He). The result confirms the ones reported
from the observation of the low energy muons at the surface (typically in the
GeV energy range), showing that the conclusions do not depend on the production
region kinematics. Thus, the hadronic interaction model used (CORSIKA/QGSJET)
provides consistent composition results from data related to secondaries
produced in a rapidity region exceeding the central one. Such an evolution of
the composition in the knee region supports the ""standard"" galactic
acceleration/propagation models that imply rigidity dependent breaks of the
different components, and therefore breaks occurring at lower energies in the
spectra of the light nuclei.

lattice. The spin susceptibility is described in a form consistent with a
physical picture of Kondo lattices: Local spin fluctuations at different sites
interact with each other by a bare intersite exchange interaction, which is
mainly composed of two terms such as the superexchange interaction, which
arises from the virtual exchange of spin-channel pair excitations of electrons
across the Mott-Hubbard gap, and an exchange interaction arising from that of
Gutzwiller's quasi-particles. The bare exchange interaction is enhanced by
intersite spin fluctuations developed because of itself. The enhanced exchange
interaction is responsible for the development of superconducting fluctuations
as well as the Cooper pairing between Gutzwiller's quasi-particles. On the
basis of the microscopic theory, we develop a phenomenological theory of
low-temperature superconductivity and pseudo-gaps in the under-doped region as
well as high-temperature superconductivity in the optimal-doped region.
Anisotropic pseudo-gaps open mainly because of d\gamma-wave superconducting
low-energy fluctuations: Quasi-particle spectra around (\pm\pi/a,0) and
(0,\pm\pi/a), with a the lattice constant, or X points at the chemical
potential are swept away by strong inelastic scatterings, and quasi-particles
are well defined only around (\pm\pi/2a,\pm\pi/2a) on the Fermi surface or
line. As temperatures decrease in the vicinity of superconducting critical
temperatures, pseudo-gaps become smaller and the well-defined region is
extending toward X points. The condensation of d\gamma-wave Cooper pairs
eventually occurs at low enough temperatures when the pair breaking by
inelastic scatterings becomes small enough.

address the fundamental limit imposed by this loss on the temperature that may
be obtained by sympathetic cooling of fermions by bosons. Both a quantum
Boltzmann equation and a quantum Boltzmann \emph{master} equation are used to
study the evolution of the occupation number distribution. It is shown that, in
the thermodynamic limit, the Fermi gas cools to a minimal temperature $k_{{\rm

is demonstrated that, beyond the thermodynamic limit, the discrete nature of
the momentum spectrum of the system can block cooling. The unusual non-thermal
nature of the number distribution is illustrated from several points of view:
the Fermi surface is distorted, and in the region of zero momentum the number
distribution can descend to values significantly less than unity. Our model
explicitly depends on a constant evaporation rate, the value of which can

photoproduction and the electroproduction regime, study still needed to clarify
the J\psi production mechanisms. Second the analysis of D* photoproduction
events, study than can lead to a better understanding of the photon structure.

that it contains only the four form factors. Then we get the closed integral

M is fibered over a circle, the fibers are Sasakian, the fibration is locally
trivial, and M is reconstructed as a Riemannian suspension from the Sasakian
structure on the fibers and the monodromy automorphism induced by this
fibration. This construction is canonical and functorial in both directions.

depends on basic global and local data. Global data concerns the intersection

What we try to do here is to give a general and comprehensive approach to the

like particular cases. This general approach consists of a transformation of
the problem of constructing magic borders to a simpler - almost trivial - form.
In the first section, we give some definitions and notation. The second section
consists of the exposition and proof of our method for the diferent cases that
appear (theorems 1 and 2). Although methods for the construction of bordered
magic squares have always been presented as individual succesful attempts to
solve the problem, we will see that a common pattern underlies the fundamental
mechanisms that lead to the construction of such squares. This approach
provides techniques for constructing many magic bordered squares of any order,
which is a first step to construct all of them, and finally know how many
bordered squares are for any order. These may be the first elements of a
general theory on bordered magic squares.

long-term correlations and multifractal behaviour in the presence of trends, we
apply several recently developed methods [detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA),
wavelet analysis, and multifractal DFA] that can systematically detect and
overcome nonstationarities in the data at all time scales. We find that above
some crossover time that usually is several weeks, the daily runoffs are
long-term correlated, being characterized by a correlation function C(s) that
decays as C(s) ~ s^(gamma). The exponent gamma varies from river to river in a
wide range between 0.1 and 0.9. The power-law decay of C(s) corresponds to a
power-law increase of the related fluctuation function F_2(s) ~ s^H where H =
1-gamma/2. We also find that in most records, for large times, weak
multifractality occurs. The Renyi exponent tau(q) for q between -10 and +10 can
be fitted to the remarkably simple form tau(q) = -ln(a^q+b^q) /ln 2, with

further important aspect is the resolution of library dependencies, which occur
when a user runs self-compiled jobs on machines, where these libraries are not
installed. These dependencies are also resolved with this layers.

the simple quantum circuit to redistribute the biases (polarizations) of qubits
and small time complexity. However, our numerical simulation shows that the
number of qubits initialized by the scheme is rather smaller than expected from
the von Neumann entropy because of an increase in the sum of the binary
entropies of individual qubits, which indicates a growth in the total classical
correlation. This result--namely, that there is such a significant growth in
the total binary entropy--disagrees with that of their analysis.

electrons, neutrinos and protons as particles bound by their own potentials.
Classical electromagnetism and the Dirac electron theory appear to be natural
extensions of the physics that rules the electron itself. However, the charge
density and the negative energy eigenvalues are two concepts which cannot
survive further scrutiny. The electron and the proton resemble minute planetary
systems where the bispinor terms defining their physical properties revolve
with definite angular momentum around the singular point of the particles'
potentials. The mass of the electron--neutrino in relation to the electron's
and the mass of the latter in relation to the proton's are determined under
particular assumptions. The most important feature of the new approach is the
faithful representation of free particles at rest with respect to inertial
systems of reference. This certainly enhances the foundation of physics;
precisely in the realm of Quantum Mechanics, where the customary description of
free electrons is a confusing consequence of the limited scope of the
Schr\""{o}dinger and Dirac equations.

decoherence in the entire process. Further, we demonstrate the possibility of
an efficient quantum memory for arbitrary superposition of two modes of a

apply the unknown unitary to one of the two parts and then measure the joint

separable (e.g., LOCC). A comparison is made between these possibilities and it
is shown that by using non-separable measurements one can improve the accuracy
of the estimation by a factor of $2(d+1)/d$ where $d$ is the dimension of the
Hilbert space on which $U$ acts.

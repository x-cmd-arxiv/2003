  Physical Review D","Phys.Rev. D68 (2003) 021302","10.1103/PhysRevD.68.021302",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a study of the 3-pt angular correlation function w_3= <delta_1
delta_2 delta_3> of (adimensional) temperature anisotropies measured by the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Results can be normalized to the
2-point function w_2 = <delta_1 delta_2> in terms of the hierarchical: q_3 ~
w_3/w_2^2 or dimensionless: d_3 ~ w_2/w_2^{3/2}$ amplitudes. Strongly
non-Gaussian models are generically expected to show d_3 > 1 or q_3 > 10^3 d_3.
Unfortunately, this is comparable to the cosmic variance on large angular
scales. For Gaussian primordial models, q_3 gives a direct measure of the
non-linear corrections to temperature anisotropies in the sky: delta = delta_L
+ f_{NLT} (delta_L^2 - <delta_L^2>) with f_{NLT} = q_3/2 for the leading order
term in w_2^2. We find good agreement with the Gaussian hypothesis d_3 ~ 0
within the cosmic variance of LCDM simulations (with or without a low
quadrupole). The strongest constraints on q_3 come from scales smaller than 1
degree. We find q_3 =19 +/-141 for (pseudo) collapsed configurations and an
average of q_3 = 336 +/-218 for non-collapsed triangles. The corresponding
non-linear coupling parameter, f_{NL}, for curvature perturbations Phi, in the
Sachs-Wolfe (SW) regime is: f_{NL}^{SW} = q_3/6, while on degree scales, the
extra power in acoustic oscillations produces f_{NL} ~ q_3/30 in the LCM model.
Errors are dominated by cosmic variance, but for the first time they begin to
be small enough to constrain the leading order non-linear effects with coupling
of order unity.

associated jets, within the scheme of an accretion rate-dependent state
transition. Below a critical value of the accretion rate all systems are
assumed to undergo a transition to a state where the dominant accretion mode is
optically thin and radiatively inefficient. In these significantly
sub-Eddington systems, the spectral energy distribution is predicted to be
dominated by non-thermal emission from a relativistic jet whereas
near-Eddington black holes will be dominated instead by emission from the
accretion disk. Reasonable candidates for such a sub-Eddington state include
X-ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states, the Galactic Center (Sgr A*),
LINERs, FR I radio galaxies, and a large fraction of BL Lac objects. Standard
jet physics predicts non-linear scaling between the optically thick (radio) and
optically thin (optical or X-ray) emission of these systems, which has been
confirmed recently in X-ray binaries. We show that this scaling relation is
also a function of black hole mass and only slightly of the relativistic
Doppler factor. Taking the scaling into account we show that indeed hard and
quiescent state X-ray binaries, LINERs, FR I radio galaxies, and BL Lacs can be
unified and fall on a common radio/X-ray correlation. This suggests that jet
domination is an important stage in the luminosity evolution of accreting black
hole systems.

stars, 6 Population II Cepheids, and 12 long period variables. Of the RR Lyrae
stars observed in this survey, 26 are pulsating in the fundamental mode with a
mean period of 0.753d and 12 are first-overtone mode pulsators with a mean
period of 0.365d. These values match up very well with those found in
ground-based surveys. Combining all the available data for NGC 6441, we find
mean periods of 0.759d and 0.375d for the RRab and RRc stars, respectively. We
also find that the RR Lyrae in this survey are located in the same regions of a
period-amplitude diagram as those found in ground-based surveys. Although NGC
6441 is a metal-rich globular cluster, its RR Lyrae more closely resemble those
in Oosterhoff type II globular clusters. However, even compared to typical
Oosterhoff type II systems, the mean period of its RRab stars is unusually
long. We also derived I-band period-luminosity relations for the RR Lyrae
stars. Of the six Population II Cepheids, five are of W Virginis type and one
is a BL Herculis variable stars. This makes NGC 6441, along with NGC 6388, the
most metal-rich globular cluster known to contain these types of variable
stars. Another variable, V118, may also be a Population II Cepheid given its
long period and its separation in magnitude from the RR Lyrae stars. We argue
that there does not appear to be a change in the period-luminosity relation
slope between the BL Herculis and W Virginis stars, but that a change of slope
does occur when the RV Tauri stars are added to the period-luminosity relation.

distribution and the power spectrum information for a particular X-ray survey
(DUET) and two SZE surveys (SPT & Planck), the constraints on the dark energy
equation of state w can be improved by roughly a factor of 4. Because surveys
designed to study the redshift distribution of clusters will have all the
information necessary to construct P_cl(k), the benefit of adding P_cl(k) in
reducing uncertainties comes at no additional observational cost. Combining
detailed mass studies of 100 clusters with the redshift distribution improves
the parameter uncertainties by a factor of 3-5. The data required for these
detailed mass measurements-- assumed to have 1sigma uncertainties of 30-- are
accumulating in the the XMM-Newton and Chandra archives. The best constraints
are obtained when one combines both the power spectrum constraints and mass
measurements with the cluster redshift distribution; when using the survey to
extract the parameters and evolution of the mass--observable relations, we
estimate the uncertainties on w of ~4% to 6%. These parameter constraints are
obtained from self-calibrating cluster surveys alone. In combination with CMB

leads to the disruption of a large number of clusters. A power-law initial
globular cluster system mass function (GCMF) similar to that observed in young
cluster systems in merging galaxies is transformed by this dissolution into a
bell-shaped GCMF with a mean mass similar to that of old GCSs for all the
galaxies investigated. Two-body relaxation and dynamical friction, which are
also included in our simulations, subsequently lead to an additional
significant evolution and disruption of the population of clusters. As shown
previously, when these processes act on a bell-shaped GCMF with a mean mass
similar to that of old GCS, they do not significantly alter the value of the

are derived by the Hamilton-Jacobi method: one begins with the 2-body Hamilton
equations, performs a canonical transformation to the orbital elements, and
obtains the Delaunay system. A standard trick is then used to generalise the
approach to the N-body case. We re-examine this step and demonstrate that it
contains an implicit condition which restricts the dynamics to a
9(N-1)-dimensional submanifold of the 12(N-1)-dimensional space spanned by the
elements and their time derivatives. The tacit condition is equivalent to the
so-called Lagrange constraint. It is the condition of the orbital elements
being osculating, i.e., of the instantaneous ellipse (or hyperbola) being
always tangential to the physical velocity. Imposure of any condition different
from the Lagrange constraint (but compatible with the equations of motion) is
legitimate and will not alter the physical trajectory or velocity (though will
alter the mathematical form of the planetary equations).
  This freedom of nomination of the supplementary constraint reveals a
gauge-type internal symmetry of the celestial-mechanics equations and has
consequences for the stability of numerical integrators. Another important
aspect of this freedom is that any gauge different from that of Lagrange makes
the Delaunay system non-canonical. In a more general setting, when the
disturbance depends not only upon positions but also upon velocities, there is
a ""generalised Lagrange gauge"" wherein the Delaunay system is symplectic. This
gauge renders orbital elements that are osculating in the phase space. It
coincides with the regular Lagrange gauge when the perturbation is
velocity-independent.

5000 cm-3 collisional redistribution is not complete, this effect has to be
taken into account to derive the O abundances for those cases in which not all
the lines of the multiplet are observed. From the 4649 OII versus N_e$(ClIII)
diagram we find a critical electron density of 1325 cm-3 for collisional
redistribution of the OII lines of multiplet 1. Also based on this diagram we
argue that the OII and the [OIII] lines originate in the same regions. We also
find that the radial velocities and the FWHM of the OII and [OIII] lines in NGC
5307 are similar supporting the previous result. These two results imply that
for NGC 5307 and probably for many other gaseous nebulae chemical
inhomogeneities are not responsible for the large temperature fluctuations
observed.

ionized gas in the mini-spiral in the central parsec. PaA emission is also seen
from 26 stellar sources, presumably early-type stars with mass-loss winds. The
new data reveal significant small-scale structure (<1""~0.04pc) in the ionized
gas of the mini-spiral; low surface brightness emission features are also seen
for the first time. Extinction, estimated from the ratio of observed PaA
emission to 6-cm continuum emission, varies from 20 to 50 mag with a median
Av=31.1 mag, in excellent agreement with earlier estimates for the stellar
sources and indepedent measurements derived using H92alpha recombination line
data. Large increases in extinction are seen along the periphery of the ionized
gas, suggesting that the ionized gas is partially extincted by dust in the
molecular clouds at the outside of the ionized regions. The small-scale,
filamentary structures in the ionized gas have a free thermal expansion time of
only ~ 3000 yrs; either magnetic fields or mass-loss winds from the hot
emission line stars may contain the ionized filaments. For both the ionized gas
and the stellar continuum, the centroids of the emission remain within ~+/- 1""
from a radius of 2"" out to 40"", providing further evidence that Sgr A* is
indeed at or extremely close to the dynamical center of the Galactic nucleus

0.9"" and then decreases or levels off closer to Sgr A*, possibly indicating the
core radius of the central stellar distribution or depletion of the late-type

that reionization is likely to occur at a redshift $z_{reion} = 17^{+10}_{-7}$,
consistent with the WMAP determination based on the temperature-polarization
cross power spectrum. We estimate the delay in reionization if there is a
negative running of the spectral index, as weakly indicated by WMAP. We then
investigate the dependence of the reionization redshift on the nature of the
initial perturbations. We consider chi-squared probability distribution
functions with various degrees of freedom, motivated both by non-standard
inflationary scenarios and by defect models. We find that in these models
reionization is likely occur much earlier, and to be a slower process, than in
the case of initial gaussian fluctuations. We also consider a hybrid model in
which cosmic strings make an important contribution to the seed fluctuations on
scales relevant for reionization. We find that in order for that model to agree
with the latest WMAP results, the string contribution to the matter power
spectrum on the standard $8 h^{-1} Mpc$ scale is likely to be at most at the
level of one percent, which imposes tight constraints on the value of the
string mass per unit length.

kinematics, we separated stars into two populations: the first one has a
positive velocity of rotation around the galactic center, and it is likely to
be related to the dissipational collapse of the galaxy; the second one has
either negligible or negative rotational velocity, and it is likely related to
an accretion component. The two populations show a large overlap in
metallicity. However, they show distinct chemical properties. For the first
population we found that there are close correlations (with small scatters
around) of the rotational velocity with metallicity and with the Fe/alpha
abundance ratio: this might be a signature of a not very fast collapse of the
progenitor clouds, with enough time for a significant contribution by SNe Ia,
although this result needs to be confirmed by a 3-D/non-LTE study. On the other
side, the second population exhibits a larger scatter in both the above
mentioned relations, and on average, a larger Fe/alpha ratio at a given
metallicity, suggesting a larger scatter in ages. We argue that the lack of
stars with moderate rotational velocities and high Fe/alpha abundance ratios is
due to the short merging time for protogalactic clouds with prograde motion,
while the presence of a group of counter-rotating stars with this
characteristics indicates a much longer typical lifetimes for protogalactic
fragments having such a motion. Finally, we found that perigalactic distances
correlate with the Fe/alpha abundance ratios better than the apogalactic
distances.

disordered systems. We emphasise generic aspects of such problems and parallels
with disordered, non-interacting systems of fermions, and discuss in particular
the relevance for bosonic excitations of symmetry classes known in the
fermionic context. We also stress important differences between bosonic and
fermionic problems. One of these follows from the fact that ground state
stability of a system requires all bosonic excitation energy levels to be
positive, while stability in systems of non-interacting fermions is ensured by
the exclusion principle, whatever the single-particle energies. As a
consequence, simple models of uncorrelated disorder are less useful for bosonic
systems than for fermionic ones, and it is generally important to study the
excitation spectrum in conjunction with the problem of constructing a
disorder-dependent ground state: we show how a mapping to an operator with
chiral symmetry provides a useful tool for doing this. A second difference
involves the distinction for bosonic systems between excitations which are
Goldstone modes and those which are not. In the case of Goldstone modes we
review established results illustrating the fact that disorder decouples from
excitations in the low frequency limit, above a critical dimension $d_c$, which
in different circumstances takes the values $d_c=2$ and $d_c=0$. For bosonic
excitations which are not Goldstone modes, we argue that an excitation density
varying with frequency as $\rho(\omega) \propto \omega^4$ is a universal
feature in systems with ground states that depend on the disorder realisation.
We illustrate our conclusions with extensive analytical and some numerical
calculations for a variety of models in one dimension.

that for Ca concentrations x=0.4 and 0.5, the appearance of (0, k+1/2, 0)
reflections are originated by the orbital ordering of the eg electrons in the

the orbital ordering is only considered and it occurs at (0, k, 0) reflections.
A rigorous analysis of all these resonance reflections will show the inadequacy
of the charge-orbital model proposed to explain the experimental results. In
addition, this charge-orbital model is highly inconsistent with the electronic
balance. On the contrary, these reflections can be easily understood as arising
from the anisotropy of charge distribution induced by the presence of local
distortions, i.e. due to a structural phase transition.

fundamental of those characteristics is the dependence of the superconducting
transition temperature on the degree of electronic band filling. Since the
discovery of cuprate superconductivity in 1986 (1), the search for other
families of superconductors that might help shed light on the superconducting

superconductivity near 4K in the triangular lattice, layered sodium cobalt

related to the cuprates may be found (2). Here we show that the superconducting
transition temperature of this compound displays the same kind of band-filling
behavior that is observed in the cuprates. Specifically, that the optimal
superconducting Tc occurs in a narrow range of band filling, and decreases for
both underdoped and overdoped materials, in dramatic analogy to the phase
diagram of the cuprate superconductors. Our results suggest that
characterization of the detailed electronic and magnetic behavior of these new

Under strong microwave driving it was possible to induce hundreds of coherent
oscillations. Pulsed operations on this first sample yielded a relaxation time
of 900 nanoseconds and a free-induction dephasing time of 20 nanoseconds. These
results are promising for future solid-state quantum computing.

  at First Order Phase Transition Points in Lattice Spin Models","4 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.015702",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  We report about two new rigorous results on the non-analytic properties of
thermodynamic potentials at first order phase transition. The first one is
valid for lattice models ($d\geq 2$) with arbitrary finite state space, and
finite-range interactions which have two ground states. Under the only
assumption that the Peierls Condition is satisfied for the ground states and
that the temperature is sufficiently low, we prove that the pressure has no
analytic continuation at the first order phase transition point. The second
result concerns Ising spins with Kac potentials
$J_\gamma(x)=\gamma^d\phi(\gamma x)$, where $0<\gamma<1$ is a small scaling
parameter, and $\phi$ a fixed finite range potential. In this framework, we
relate the non-analytic behaviour of the pressure at the transition point to
the range of interaction, which equals $\gamma^{-1}$. Our analysis exhibits a
crossover between the non-analytic behaviour of finite range models
($\gamma>0$) and analyticity in the mean field limit ($\gamma\searrow 0$). In
general, the basic mechanism responsible for the appearance of a singularity
blocking the analytic continuation is that arbitrarily large droplets of the
other phase become stable at the transition point.

different $MgB_2$ samples alloyed with nonmagnetic impurities. By studying
films and bulk polycrystals with different resistivities $\rho$, we show a
clear trend of $H_{c2}$ increase as $\rho$ increases. One particular high
resistivity film had zero-temperature $H_{c2}(0)$ well above the $H_{c2}$
values of competing non-cuprate superconductors such as $Nb_3Sn$ and Nb-Ti. Our
high-field transport measurements give record values $H_{c2}^\perp (0) \approx
34T$ and $H_{c2}\|(0) \approx 49 T$ for high resistivity films and
$H_{c2}(0)\approx 29 T$ for untextured bulk polycrystals. The highest $H_{c2}$
film also exhibits a significant upward curvature of $H_{c2}(T)$, and
temperature dependence of the anisotropy parameter $\gamma(T) = H_{c2}\|/
H_{c2}^\perp$ opposite to that of single crystals: $\gamma(T)$ decreases as the
temperature decreases, from $\gamma(T_c) \approx 2$ to $\gamma(0) \approx 1.5$.
This remarkable $H_{c2}$ enhancement and its anomalous temperature dependence
are a consequence of the two-gap superconductivity in $MgB_2$, which offers
special opportunities for further $H_{c2}$ increase by tuning of the impurity
scattering by selective alloying on Mg and B sites. Our experimental results
can be explained by a theory of two-gap superconductivity in the dirty limit.
The very high values of $H_{c2}(T)$ observed suggest that $MgB_2$ can be made
into a versatile, competitive high-field superconductor.

many practical applications. From theoretical point of view, the key interest
is in a proper description of the structure and dynamics of correlations. From
practical point of view, the emphasis is on the ability of the developed models
to provide the adequate input for the numerous portfolio and risk management
procedures used in the financial industry. This is crucial, since it has been
long argued that correlation matrices determined from financial series contain
a relatively large amount of noise and, in addition, most of the portfolio and
risk management techniques used in practice can be quite sensitive to the
inputs. In this paper we introduce a model (simulation)-based approach which
can be used for a systematic investigation of the effect of the different
sources of noise in financial correlations in the portfolio and risk management
context. To illustrate the usefulness of this framework, we develop several toy
models for the structure of correlations and, by considering the finiteness of
the time series as the only source of noise, we compare the performance of
several correlation matrix estimators introduced in the academic literature and
which have since gained also a wide practical use. Based on this experience, we
believe that our simulation-based approach can also be useful for the
systematic investigation of several other problems of much interest in finance.

signatures, making these binaries important candidates for detection in
gravitational wave observatories. The gravitational radiation is characterized
by the orbital parameters, including the frequency and separation at the
inner-most stable circular orbit (ISCO). One approach to estimating these
parameters relies on a sequence of initial data slices that attempt to capture
the physics of the inspiral. Using calculations of the binding energy, several
authors have estimated the ISCO parameters using initial data constructed with
various algorithms. In this paper we examine this problem using conformally
Kerr-Schild initial data. We present convergence results for our initial data
solutions, and give data from numerical solutions of the constraint equations
representing a range of physical configurations. In a first attempt to
understand the physical content of the initial data, we find that the Newtonian
binding energy is contained in the superposed Kerr-Schild background before the
constraints are solved. We examine some deficiencies with the initial data
approach to orbiting binaries, especially touching on the effects of prior
motion and spin-orbital coupling of the angular momenta. Making rough estimates
of these effects, we find that they are not insignificant compared to the
binding energy, leaving some doubt of the utility of using initial data to
predict ISCO parameters. In computations of specific initial-data
configurations we find spin-specific effects that are consistent with
analytical estimates.

involved might be SO(3) rather than SU(2) with attendant difficulties. We argue
that the assumption that a version of the Pauli principle is present in loop
quantum gravity allows one to maintain SU(2) as the gauge group while still
naturally achieving the desired suppression of spin-1/2 punctures. Areas come
from j=1 punctures rather than j=1/2 punctures for much the same reason that
photons lead to macroscopic classically observable fields while electrons do
not.

on to consider the issue of stability when the system approaches the critical

observed features of fermion masses such as the ratio m_b/m_tau, the smallness

route to higher unification based on an effective string-unified G(224) =

other alternatives.
  A predictive framework based on an effective SO(10) or G(224) symmetry
possessing supersymmetry is presented that successfully describes the masses
and mixings of all fermions including neutrinos. It also accounts for the
observed baryon asymmetry of the universe by utilizing the process of
leptogenesis, which is natural to this framework. It is argued that a
conservative upper limit on the proton lifetime within this

10^34 years. This in turn strongly suggests that an improvement in the current

states that the entropy of a weakly gravitating isolated matter system will not

be derived directly from the following phenomenological assumptions: that
entropy can be computed by integrating an entropy current which vanishes on the
initial boundary and whose gradient is bounded by the energy density. Though we
note that any local description of entropy has intrinsic limitations, we argue

the metric tensor and determines how gravity affects the light cone structure
of the space-time. This, in turn, leads to the existence of observers (in any
space-time) who do not have access to regions of space-time bounded by
horizons. To take into account this generic possibility, it is necessary to
demand that \emph{physical theories in a given coordinate system must be
formulated entirely in terms of variables that an observer using that
coordinate system can access}. This principle is powerful enough to obtain the
following results: (a) The action principle of gravity must be of such a
structure that, in the semiclassical limit, the action of the unobserved
degrees of freedom reduces to a boundary contribution $A_{\rm boundary}$
obtained by integrating a four divergence. (b) When the boundary is a horizon,
$A_{\rm boundary}$ essentially reduces to a single, well-defined, term. (c)
This boundary term must have a quantized spectrum with uniform spacing, $\Delta
A_{boundary}=2\pi\hbar$, in the semiclassical limit. Using this principle in
conjunction with the usual action principle in gravity, we show that: (i) The
area of any one-way membrane is quantized. (ii) The information hidden by a
one-way membrane leads to an entropy which is always one-fourth of the area of
the membrane, in the leading order. (iii) In static space-times, the action for
gravity can be given a purely thermodynamic interpretation and the Einstein
equations have a formal similarity to laws of thermodynamics.

it corresponds to the vacuum of the Yang-Mills theory. This implies that all

non-compact (cusped) manifold M, but he did not prove the volume is
well-defined in all cases. We prove here that the volume of a representation is
always well-defined and depends only on the representation. We show that this
volume can be easily computed by straightening any ideal triangulation of M. We
show that the volume of a representation is bounded from above by the relative
simplicial volume of M. Finally, we prove a rigidity theorem for
representations of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic manifold. Namely, we
prove that if M is hyperbolic and vol(\rho)=vol(M) then \rho is discrete and
faithful.

near the saddle-centre bifurcation the twist always vanishes. At this
bifurcation a ``twistless'' torus is created, when the resonance is passed. The
twistless torus replaces the colliding periodic orbits in phase space. We
explicitly derive the position of the twistless torus depending on the

the period doubling bifurcation the situation is different. Here we show that

width balance in the root-mean-square sense exists, the beam profile becomes
strongly deformed during propagation and may exhibit the phenomena of global
and partial collapse.

about an interface between equations of motion and the stillness of
experimental records. Here we delineate an interface between wave functions as
language to describe motion and Turing tapes as language to describe
experimental records. After extending quantum formalism to make this interface
explicit, we report on constraints and freedoms in choosing quantum-mechanical
equations to model experiments with devices. We prove that choosing equations
of wave functions and operators to achieve a fit between calculated
probabilities and experimental records requires reaching beyond both logic and
the experimental records. Although informed by experience, a ""reach beyond"" can
fairly be called a guess.
  Recognizing that particles as features of wave functions depend on guesswork,
we introduce their use not as objects of physical investigation but as elements
of thought in quantum-mechanical models of devices. We make informed guesses to
offer a quantum-mechanical model of a 1-bit recording device in a metastable
condition. Probabilities calculated from the model fit an experimental record
of an oscillation in a time-varying probability, showing a
temperature-independent role for Planck's constant in what heretofore was
viewed as a ""classical"" electronic device.

interpretation of these experiments could be feasible, if some different
alternative assumptions other than the fair sampling were used. For this
purpose, we derive an efficient Bell-type inequality which is a CHSH-type
inequality in real experiments. Quantum mechanics violates our proposed
inequality, independent of the detection-efficiency problems.

The experimental test of this criterion amounts to the observation of the

field of research despite the fact that quantum information, as a precise
concept, is undefined. Indeed the very idea of viewing quantum states as
carriers of some kind of information (albeit unknowable in classical terms),
leads naturally to interesting questions that might otherwise never have been
asked, and corresponding new insights. We will discuss some illustrative
examples, including a strengthening of the well known no-cloning theorem
leading to a property of permanence for quantum information, and considerations
arising from information compression that reflect on fundamental issues.

hydrogen in the spiral galaxy ESO 123-G23. The optical appearance of this
galaxy is an almost perfectly edge-on disk, while the neutral hydrogen is found
to extend vertically out to about 15 kpc on either side of the galactic plane.
The HI layer and the major features of the HI data cube can be successfully
explained by a model dominated by a strong (about 30 degrees) line-of-sight
warp. Other models were tried, including a flare model and a two-component
model, but they clearly do not reproduce the data. This is the first
unambiguous detection of a galactic warp that has the maximum deviation from
the central plane almost along the line-of-sight. No evidence for the presence
of any companion galaxy is found in the HI data cube. Line-of-sight warps in
edge-on galaxies are probably frequent, but escape detection as they are too
weak. Moreover they may easily be mistaken as flares or 'thick disks'. A 3-D
modelling of the HI layer as the one presented here is needed in order to
distinguish between these possibilities.

this magnetic helicity flux is mostly due to small scale magnetic fields; in
contrast to the more systematic large scale field of the 11 year cycle, whose
helicity flux may be of opposite sign, and may be excluded from the
observational interpretation. Using idealized simulations of MHD turbulence as
well as a simple two-scale model, we show that shedding small scale (helical)
field has two important effects. (i) The strength of the large scale field
reaches the observed levels. (ii) The evolution of the large scale field
proceeds on time scales shorter than the resistive time scale, as would
otherwise be enforced by magnetic helicity conservation. In other words, the
losses ensure that the solar dynamo is always in the near-kinematic regime.
This requires, however, that the ratio of small scale to large scale losses
cannot be too small, for otherwise the large scale field in the near-kinematic
regime will not reach the observed values.

evolution of actively star-forming and passively evolving galaxies in order to
understand the history of galaxy formation in the context of cosmic structure
formation; (2) to determine the evolution of the spatial distribution and
clustering of evolved galaxies, starbursts and AGN in the key redshift range,
0.5<z<3, over which much of cosmic evolution has occurred; (3) to determine the
evolutionary relationship between ``normal galaxies'' and AGN, and the
contribution of AGN accretion energy vs stellar nucleosynthesis to the cosmic
backgrounds. SWIRE's large area is important to create statistically
significant population samples over enough volume cells that we can resolve the
star formation history as a function of epoch and environment The large volume
is also optimised for finding rare objects.

because, once a relativistic fireball is created, the physics of the afterglow

linear polarization in the prompt gamma-ray emission from GRB021206, which
indicates that it is synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in a

requires a uniform, large-scale magnetic field over the gamma-ray emission
region. A large-scale magnetic field constrains possible progenitors to those
either having or producing organized fields. We suggest that the large magnetic

[Fe/H]II is correlated linearly with W', the reduced strength of the
near-infrared CaII triplet defined by Rutledge et al (1997), although the
correlation coefficients depend on the stellar atmosphere model employed. In
addition to the 66 globular cluster metallicity estimates presented in a recent

predictions thus include the full contribution from non-linear magnification
that is due to lensing halos. We compare the model prediction with ray-tracing

  The non-linear magnification contribution enhances the amplitude of the
magnification correlation relative to the weak lensing approximation, and the
non-linear correction is more significant on smaller angular scales and for
sources at higher redshifts. The enhancement amounts to 10-25% on arcminite
scales for the QSO-galaxy cross-correlation, even after inclusion of a

(which were accurate only for near-equilibrium H2 molecule sizes). This new PES
has an rms error of 0.95 millihartree (0.60 kcal/mole) relative to the the

2.97 millihartree (1.87 kcal/mole) relative to the full set of 20203 ab initio

first excited state is the largest source of error in the PES.

The dispersion starts to be constant for an acceleration of gravity of a =

globular cluster M15 where the profile flattens out for a = 1.7e-8 cm/s/s. In
both cases the acceleration is comparable to that at which the effect of dark

make in both clusters the dispersion profile flat starting exactly at the same

1000 of these haloes in a 20 Mpc/h void. A typical void of diameter 20 Mpc/h
contains about 50 haloes with v_circ > 50 km/s. The haloes are arranged in a
pattern, which looks like a miniature Universe: it has the same structural
elements as the large-scale structure of the galactic distribution of the
Universe. There are filaments and voids; larger haloes are at the intersections
of filaments. The only difference is that all masses are four orders of
magnitude smaller. There is severe (anti)bias in the distribution of haloes,
which depends on halo mass and on the distance from the centre of the void.
Large haloes are more antibiased and have a tendency to form close to void
boundaries. The mass function of haloes in voids is different from the
``normal'' mass function. It is much steeper for high masses resulting in very
few M33-type galaxies (v_circ about 100 km/s). We present an analytical

kinematic dynamo problem in a high Prandtl number regime. The scales of the
magnetic turbulence we consider are far smaller than the Kolmogorov dissipative
scale, so that the magnetic wavepackets evolve in a nearly smooth velocity
field. Firstly, we consider the Kraichnan-Kazantsev model (KKM) in which the
strain matrix is taken to be independent of coordinate and Gaussian white in
time. To simulate the KKM we use a stochastic Euler-Maruyama method. We test
the theoretical predictions for the growth of rates of the magnetic energy and
higher order moments (Kazantsev, 1968; Kulsrud & Anderson, 1992; Chertkov et
al., 1999), the shape of the energy spectrum (Kazantsev, 1968; Kulsrud &

behaviour of the polarisation and spectral flatness Nazarenko et al., 2003). In
general, the results appear to be in good agreement with the theory, with the
exception that the predicted decay of the polarisation in time is not
reproduced well in the stochastic numerics. Secondly, in order to study the
sensitivity of the KKM predictions to the choice of strain statistics, we
perform additional simulations for the case of a Gaussian strain with a finite
correlation time and also for a strain taken from a DNS data set. These
experiments are based on non-stochastic schemes, using a timestep that is much
smaller than the correlation time of the strain. We find that the KKM is
generally insensitive to the choice of strain statistics and most KKM results,
including the decay of the polarisation, are reproduced well. The only
exception appears to be the flatness whose spectrum is not reproduced in
accordance with the KKM predictions in these simulations.

II absorption redwards of its systemic velocity and is perhaps a mini low
ionization BAL QSO at z = 0.885. If the latter can be confirmed, PKS 0537-441
is the first BL Lacertae object being a member of a binary Quasar. We also
detected extended [O II] emission in the off-nuclear spectrum of PKS 05371-441,
which is most likely due to photoionization from the active nucleus.
Alternatively, the extended [O II] emission is due to jet-cloud interaction
with the counterjet of PKS 0537-441. Our clustering analysis indicates that PKS
0537-441 is located in a cluster environment as rich as Abell type 0-1. This is
supported by the detection of four galaxies in the field with similar redshifts
as the BL Lac (Delta z < 0.002). We found serendipitously even more galaxies at
somewhat higher redshifts (z = 0.9-1). Thus, PKS0537-441 might be located in
front of a galaxy cluster at somewhat higher redshift or even be part of a
large-scale structure with an extension towards the BL Lac.

reproduce the spatial distribution and kinematics of the highest z-height gas.
We are able to model the high-latitude emission as an additional HI component
in the form of a ``thick disk'' or ``halo'' with a FWHM~3.3 kpc. We find
tentative evidence that the vertically extended gas declines in rotational
velocity as a function of z, although we are unable to completely rule out
models with constant V(z). In spite of the low star formation rate of UGC7321,
energy from supernovae may be sufficient to sustain this high-latitude gas.
However, alternative origins for this material, such as slow, sustained infall,

  This paper defines what we mean by a database. It traces the evolution of the

standard, computerized RDBMS (relational database management system). Early
computerized storage methods are reviewed including both the ISAM (Indexed

methods. Early database models are explored including the network and
hierarchical database models. Eventually, the relational, object-relational and
object-oriented databases models are discussed. An appendix of diagrams,
including hierarchical occurrence tree, network schema, ER (entity
relationship) and UML (unified modeling language) diagrams, is included to
support the text.
  This paper concludes with an exploration of current and future trends in DBMS
development. It discusses the factors affecting these trends. It delves into
the relationship between DBMSs and the increasingly popular object-oriented

could teach us something about the 3+1 dimensional case. The non-perturbative
methods developed in this case share, as basic ingredient, a reformulation of
gravity as a gauge field theory. However, these methods suffer many problems.
Firstly, this perspective abandon the non-degeneracy of the metric and
causality as fundamental principles, hoping to recover them in a certain
low-energy limit. Then, it is not clear how these combinatorial techniques
could be used in the case where matter fields are added, which are however the
essential ingredients in order to produce non trivial observables in a
generally covariant approach. Endly, considering the status of the observer in
these approaches, it is not clear at all if they really could produce a
completely covariant description of quantum gravity. We propose to re-analyse
carefully these points. This study leads us to a really covariant description
of a set of self-gravitating point masses in a closed universe. This approach
is based on a set of observables associated to the measurements accessible to a
participant-observer, they manage to capture the whole dynamic in Chern-Simons
gravity as well as in true gravity. The Dirac algebra of these observables can
be explicitely computed, and exhibits interesting algebraic features related to
Poisson-Lie groupoids theory.

calculations, the real time approach is valid for a QGP that formed and reached
LTE a short time after a collision and of finite lifetime ($\sim 10-20
\mathrm{fm}/c$ as expected at RHIC or LHC). We point out that during such
finite QGP lifetime the spectrum of emitted photons carries information on the
initial state. There is an inherent ambiguity in separating the virtual from
the observable photons during the transient evolution of the QGP. We propose a
real time formulation to extract the photon yield which includes the initial
stage of formation of the QGP parametrized by an effective time scale of
formation $\Gamma^{-1}$. This formulation coincides with the S-matrix approach
in the infinite lifetime limit. It allows to separate the virtual cloud as well
as the observable photons emitted during the pre- equilibrium stage from the
yield during the QGP lifetime. We find that the lowest order contribution
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{em})$ which does \emph{not} contribute to the S-matrix
approach, is of the same order of or larger than the S-matrix contribution
during the lifetime of the QGP for a typical formation time $\sim 1

power law fall-off $\sim T^3 \Gamma^2/k^{5}$ and is larger than that obtained
with the S-matrix for momenta $\geq 4 \mathrm{Gev}/c$. We provide a
comprehensive numerical comparison between the real time and S-matrix yields

N}=1$ supersymmetric U(1) model, where the extra dimension is compactified on a
circle. A one-loop inflaton effective 4D potential is generated, with the
inflaton being a 'Wilson-line field'. It relies on a SUSY breaking. We first
consider SUSY breaking to occur spontaneously within a 'no-scale' model by a
non zero $F$-term of the radion superfield which transmits SUSY breaking into
the 'visible' sector. As an alternative, we study $D$-term SUSY breaking
originating directly from the 5D gauge supermultiplet. Together with the usual
KK resummation method, we present a calculation with the world-line formalism.
The latter allows one to get the resulting effective potential directly as a
sum over all winding modes. For both presented scenarios, the generated
effective potentials have suitable forms for realizing successful inflation,
i.e. are flat enough and give the needed number of ${\rm e}$-foldings. In
addition, there is a natural way to get strongly suppressed values for the
potentials, which then could be associated with dark energy/quintessence.

Scherk-Schwarz (here employed only as a technical tool) discussing how to deal

transmit supersymmetry breaking from the hidden to the visible sector. In the
minimal set-up visible-sector scalars get a universal squared mass m_0^2 < 0.
In general (e.g. in presence of a sizable gravitational kinetic term localized
on the hidden brane) the radion-mediated contribution to m_0^2 can be positive

brane-to-brane effects can cure the tachyonic sleptons predicted by anomaly
mediation by adding a positive m_0^2 which is universal up to subleading

classified into the tensor, vector, and scalar-type modes according to their
tensorial behaviour on the spherical section of the background metric, where
the last two modes correspond respectively to the axial- and the polar-mode in
the four-dimensional situation. We show that, for each mode of the
perturbations, the spatial derivative part of the master equation is a
positive, self-adjoint operator in the $L^2$-Hilbert space, hence that the
master equation for each tensorial type of perturbations does not admit
normalisable negative-modes which would describe unstable solutions.
  On the same Schwarzschild background, we also analyse the static perturbation
of the scalar mode, and show that there exists no static perturbation which is
regular everywhere outside the event horizon and well-behaved at spatial
infinity. This checks the uniqueness of the higher-dimensional spherically
symmetric, static, vacuum black hole, within the perturbation framework.
  Our strategy for the stability problem is also applicable to the other
higher-dimensional maximally symmetric black holes with non-vanishing
cosmological constant. We show that all possible types of maximally symmetric

  We prove an approximate functional equation for the central value of the
L-series attached to an irreducible cuspidal automorphic representation of
GL(m) over a number field. We investigate the decay rate of the cutoff function
and its derivatives in terms of the analytic conductor introduced by Iwaniec
and Sarnak. We also see that the truncation can be made uniformly explicit at
the cost of an error term. The results extend to products of central values.
  We establish, via the Hardy-Littlewood circle method, a nontrivial bound on
shifted convolution sums of Fourier coefficients coming from classical
holomorphic or Maass cusp forms of arbitrary level and nebentypus. These sums
are analogous to the binary additive divisor sum which has been studied
extensively. We achieve polynomial uniformity in all the parameters of the cusp
forms by carefully estimating the Bessel functions that enter the analysis. As
an application we derive, extending work of Duke, Friedlander and Iwaniec, a
subconvex estimate on the critical line for L-functions associated to character
twists of these cusp forms.
  We also study the shifted convolution sums via the Sarnak-Selberg spectral
method. For holomorphic cusp forms this approach detects optimal cancellation
over any totally real number field. For Maass cusp forms the method is burdened
with complicated integral transforms. We succeed in inverting the simplest of
these transforms whose kernel is built up of Gauss hypergeometric functions.

observe that below this temperature the model protein may undergo a folding

to reduce momentum compaction factor. This paper discusses a lattice option for

discovery that the SE distribution tends to the Pareto distribution in a
certain limit such that the Pareto (or power law) distribution can be
approximated with any desired accuracy on an arbitrary interval by a suitable
adjustment of the parameters of the SE distribution, we demonstrate that Wilks'
test of nested hypothesis still works for the non-exactly nested comparison
between the SE and Pareto distributions. The SE distribution is found
significantly better over the whole quantile range but becomes unnecessary
beyond the 95% quantiles compared with the Pareto law. Similar conclusions hold

result is that the tails ultimately decay slower than any stretched exponential

experiment is excellent, here we have a supplement to their result, since our
evaluation shows that the photon effective rest mass due to the self-induced
charge currents in the environmental dilute plasma (e.g., the muon component
and other charged particles in secondary cosmic ray flux) is just the same
order of magnitude as Luo's obtained upper limit on photon mass.

due to different dissipation channels and the inability to precisely control

dissipation-assisted adiabatic passages. These are relatively fast processes
where the presence of spontaneous decay rates corrects for errors due to
non-adiabaticity while the system remains in a decoherence-free state and
behaves as predicted for an adiabatic passage. As a concrete example we present
a scheme to entangle atoms by moving them in and out of an optical cavity.

systems are identical or not. This paper treats both error-free comparison, and
comparison where errors in the result are allowed. Error-free comparison means
that we aim to obtain definite answers, which are known to be correct, as often
as possible. In general, we will have to accept also inconclusive results,
giving no information. To obtain a definite answer that the states of the
systems are not identical is always possible, whereas, in the situation
considered here, a definite answer that they are identical will not be
possible. The optimal universal error-free comparison strategy is a projection
onto the totally symmetric and the different non-symmetric subspaces, invariant
under permutations and unitary transformations. We also show how to construct
optimal comparison strategies when allowing for some errors in the result,
minimising either the error probability, or the average cost of making an
error. We point out that it is possible to realise universal error-free
comparison strategies using only linear elements and particle detectors, albeit
with less than ideal efficiency. Also minimum-error and minimum-cost strategies
may sometimes be realised in this way. This is of great significance for
practical applications of quantum comparison.

  Denmark","quant-ph math-ph math.MP math.PR",,"  We introduce a new mathematical framework for the probabilistic description
of an experiment upon a system of any type in terms of initial information
representing this system. Based on the notions of an information state, an
information state space and a generalized observable, this general framework
covers the description of a wide range of experimental situations including
those where, with respect to a system, an experiment is perturbing. We prove
that, to any experiment upon a system, there corresponds a unique generalized
observable on a system initial information state space, which defines the
probability distribution of outcomes under this experiment. We specify the case
where initial information on a system provides ""no knowledge"" for the
description of an experiment. Incorporating in a uniform way the basic notions
of conventional probability theory and the non-commutativity aspects and the
basic notions of quantum measurement theory, our framework clarifies the
principle difference between Kolmogorov's model in probability theory and the
statistical model of quantum theory. Both models are included into our
framework as particular cases. We show that the phenomenon of ""reduction"" of a
system initial information state is inherent, in general, to any
non-destructive experiment and upon a system of any type. Based on our general
framework, we introduce the probabilistic model for the description of
non-destructive experiments upon a quantum system and prove that positive
bounded linear mappings on the Banach space of trace class operators, arising
in the description of experiments upon a quantum system, are completely
positive.

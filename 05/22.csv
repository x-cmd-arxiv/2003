a distance of $\approx$ 800 Mpc might just be resolvable by VLBA after several
months. The prospects are much better for jets that are oriented sideways in
similar SNe with no GRB counterpart; in particular, the motion of the flux
centroid in such jets can be detected by VLBA up to $z\sim 1$ even when the jet
cannot be resolved. If most GRBs are accompanied by a Type Ib/c SN, then there
should be a few SN/GRB jets per year within a distance $\lesssim$ 200 Mpc, and
most of them would be oriented sideways with no gamma-ray or X-ray precursor.
Detection of these jets can be used to calibrate the fraction of all core
collapse SNe that produce relativistic outflows and determine the local GRB
rate. Overall, the rate of Type Ib/c SNe that do not produce a GRB at all, but
rather make relativistic radio jets with an initial Lorentz factor of a few,
may be larger by up to 2 orders of magnitude than the rate of those that
produce GRBs.

the viewed atmosphere non-obscured by clouds. To this end, we use space-based
IR data in concert with Monte Carlo simulated $10^{20}$ eV airshowers to
determine the acceptable event fractions. Earth-observing instruments, such as
MODIS, measure detailed cloud configurations via a CO$_2$-slicing technique
that can be used to determine cloud-top altitudes over large areas. Thus,
events can be accepted if their observed 3-dimensional endpoints occur above
low clouds as well as from areas of cloud-free atmosphere. An initial analysis
has determined that by accepting airshowers that occur above low clouds, the
non-obscured acceptance can be increased by approximately a factor of 3 over
that obtained using a cloud-free criterion.

correlation between the projected stellar mass density and the neutral hydrogen
column density (NHI) of DLAs for high NHI systems, and that there is a good
correspondence in the spatial distribution of stars and DLAs in the
simulations. The evolution of typical star-to-gas mass ratios in DLAs can be
characterised by an increase from about 2 at z=4.5 to 3 at z=3, to 10 at z=1,
and finally to 20 at z=0. We also find that the projected SFR density in DLAs
follows the Kennicutt law well at all redshifts, and the simulated values are
consistent with the recent observational estimates of this quantity by Wolfe et
al. (2003a,b). The rate of evolution in the mean metallicity of simulated DLAs
as a function of redshift is mild, and is consistent with the rate estimated
from observations. The predicted metallicity of DLAs is generally sub-solar in
our simulations, and there is a significant scatter in the distribution of DLA
metallicity for a given NHI. However, we find that the median metallicity of
simulated DLAs is close to that of Lyman-break galaxies, which is higher than
the values typically observed for DLAs by nearly an order of magnitude. This
discrepancy with observations could be due to an inadequate treatment of SN
feedback in our current simulations, perhaps indicating that metals are not
expelled efficiently enough from DLAs by outflows. Alternatively, the current
observations might be missing the majority of the high metallicity DLAs due to
selection effects. (abridged)

interstellar medium. The ROSAT all sky survey has however shown that such
accreting isolated NSs are very elusive: only a few tentative candidates have
been identified, contrary to theoretical predictions that up to several
thousands should be seen. We suggest that the fundamental reason for this
discrepancy lies in the use of the standard Bondi formula to estimate the

of the pulsar velocity distribution, realistic hydrogen atmosphere spectra, and
a modified expression for the Bondi accretion rate as suggested by recent MHD
simulations, and supported by direct observations in the case of accretion
around supermassive black holes in nearby galaxies and in our own. We find
that, whereas the inclusion of atmospheric spectra partly compensates for the
reduction in the counts due to the higher mean velocities of the new
distribution, the modified Bondi formula dramatically suppresses the source
counts. The new predictions are consistent with a null detection at the ROSAT
sensitivity.

results from recent X-ray observations of YSO. These show that there is
essentially no difference between the properties of X-ray emission from YSO
with and without outflows, imposing quite severe constraints on models based on
magnetic launching of jets. In our scenario the magnetic fields are weak, and
serve only to recollimate the outflow at large distances from the source. We
perform time scale estimates and an analytical calculation of the acceleration
of gas originating in the boundary layer (BL) of an accretion disk. By applying
global energy conservation considerations we find that the mass escaping the
system is compatible with observations. A crucial ingredient of the proposed
model is that the accreted material is strongly shocked, and then cools down on
a time scale longer than its ejection time from the disk. By using appropriate
properties of accretion disks boundary layers around YSO, we show that the
conditions for the proposed scenario to work are reasonably met. We find also
that the thermal acceleration mechanism works only when the accretion rate in
YSO accretion disk is large enough and the `alpha' parameter of the disk small
enough - otherwise the cooling time is too short and significant ejection does
not take place. This result appears to be compatible with observations as well

declined with ~ t^{-2.0}. To fit such a light curve, we consider an
ultrarelativistic jetted blast wave expanding in a density-jump medium. The
interaction of the blast wave with a large density jump produces relativistic
reverse and forward shocks. In this model, the observed rebrightening is due to
emissions from these newly forming shocks, and the late-time afterglow is
caused by sideways expansion of the jet. Our fitting implies that the

  Revised version submitted to AJ","Astron.J. 126 (2003) 1148","10.1086/377316",,"astro-ph",,"  We describe a Fourier-based method of separating bars from spirals in
near-infrared images. The method takes advantage of the fact that a bar is
typically a feature with a relatively fixed position angle, and uses the simple
assumption that the relative Fourier amplitudes due to the bar decline with
radius past a maximum in the same or a similar manner as they rose to that
maximum. With such an assumption, the bar can be extrapolated into the spiral
region and removed from an image, leaving just the spiral and the axisymmetric
background disk light. The procedure allows us to estimate the maximum
gravitational torque per unit mass per unit square of the circular speed for
the bar and spiral forcing separately, parameters which quantitatively define
the bar strength Q_b and the spiral strength Q_s following the recent study of
Buta & Block. We outline the complete procedure here using a 2.1 micron image
of NGC 6951, a prototypical SAB(rs)bc spiral. We justify our assumption on how
to make the bar extrapolation using an analysis of NGC 4394, a barred spiral
with only weak near-infrared spiral structure, and we justify the number of
needed Fourier terms using NGC 1530, one of the most strongly-barred galaxies
(bar class 7) known. We also evaluate the main uncertainties in the technique.
Allowing for uncertainties in vertical scaleheight, bar extrapolation, sky
subtraction, orientation parameters, and the asymmetry in the spiral arms
themselves, we estimate Q_b=0.28\pm0.04 and Q_s=0.21\pm0.06 for NGC 6951.

exploited by many groups since it was demonstrated that radio sources with very
steep spectra (Alpha < -1.0) are good tracers of high-z radio galaxies (HzRGs;
z>2). Though more than 150 HzRGs have been discovered up to now with this
tecnique, little is known about its real effectiveness, as most of the ongoing
searches still have incomplete follow-up programs. By selecting a new
appropriate sample of USS sources from the MRC survey, the true searching
efficiency of the USS tecnique has been quantitatively demonstrated for the
first time in this paper. Moreover it was compared with that of an optical
search of HzRGs based on a simple cut of the galaxies r-band magnitude
distribution. When no bias other than the radio-spectrum steepness is applied,
the USS tecnique may be up to 4 times more efficient in selecting HzRGs with
respect to an optical search. Nevertheless, when the search is limited to
objects fainter than the POSS-II plates (r~21), the USS tecnique is still 2.5
times more efficient (epsilonUSS =0.52 vs. epsilon_OPT= 0.19). For an optical
search to reach a comparable efficiency it is necessary to select objects
fainter than r=23, but this implies that about half of the HzRGs are lost
because of the imposed magnitude bias. The advantage of the USS tecnique is
that a ~0.5 search efficiency is already reached at the POSS-II plates limit,
where all the optical identification work is done without telescopes. However,
this tecnique has the drawback that up to 40% of the HzRGs of the sample are
lost simply because of the applied spectral index bias.

strongly suggests that the observed radial-velocity variation is being produced
by the presence of a planet, as firstly proposed. The photometric variations
are either not connected to the planetary companion, or can eventually be
induced by the interaction between the planet and the star. Finally, the
radial-velocity data further show the presence of a long term trend, whose
origin, still not clear, might be related to the presence of another companion

are compared with the exact diffusion Monte Carlo ones. A Jastrow type
correlation provides a good description of the systems, both hard- and
soft-spheres, if the hypernetted chain energy functional is freely minimized
and the resulting Euler equation is solved. The study of the soft-spheres
potentials confirms the appearance of a dependence of the energy on the shape
of the potential at gas paremeter values of $x \sim 0.001$. For quantities
other than the energy, such as the radial distribution functions and the
momentum distributions, the dependence appears at any value of $x$. The
occurrence of a maximum in the radial distribution function, in the momentum
distribution and in the excitation spectrum is a natural effect of the
correlations when $x$ increases. The asymptotic behaviors of the functions

topological excitations. The result uses a set of loop operators, analogous to
those used in gauge theories, defined in terms of the spin operators of the
theory. We also obtain various cluster bounds on expectation values for gapped
systems. These bounds are used, under the assumption of a gap, to rule out the
first case of long-range order, after which we show the existence of a
topological excitation. Compared to the ground state, the topologically excited

  Memory Model with Synaptic Delay and Pruning","27 pages, 14 figures",,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn q-bio",,"  It is known that storage capacity per synapse increases by synaptic pruning
in the case of a correlation-type associative memory model. However, the
storage capacity of the entire network then decreases. To overcome this
difficulty, we propose decreasing the connecting rate while keeping the total
number of synapses constant by introducing delayed synapses. In this paper, a
discrete synchronous-type model with both delayed synapses and their prunings
is discussed as a concrete example of the proposal. First, we explain the
Yanai-Kim theory by employing the statistical neurodynamics. This theory
involves macrodynamical equations for the dynamics of a network with serial
delay elements. Next, considering the translational symmetry of the explained
equations, we re-derive macroscopic steady state equations of the model by
using the discrete Fourier transformation. The storage capacities are analyzed
quantitatively. Furthermore, two types of synaptic prunings are treated
analytically: random pruning and systematic pruning. As a result, it becomes
clear that in both prunings, the storage capacity increases as the length of
delay increases and the connecting rate of the synapses decreases when the
total number of synapses is constant. Moreover, an interesting fact becomes
clear: the storage capacity asymptotically approaches $2/\pi$ due to random
pruning. In contrast, the storage capacity diverges in proportion to the
logarithm of the length of delay by systematic pruning and the proportion
constant is $4/\pi$. These results theoretically support the significance of
pruning following an overgrowth of synapses in the brain and strongly suggest
that the brain prefers to store dynamic attractors such as sequences and limit
cycles rather than equilibrium states.

propose a solution to this set of problems based on the so-called {\bf Master

functions into a single constraint. If certain mathematical conditions, which
still have to be proved, hold, then not only the problems with the commutator
algebra could disappear, also chances are good that one can control the
solution space and the (quantum) Dirac observables of LQG. Even a decision on
whether the theory has the correct classical limit and a connection with the
path integral (or spin foam) formulation could be in reach. While these are
exciting possibilities, we should warn the reader from the outset that, since
the proposal is, to the best of our knowledge, completely new and has been
barely tested in solvable models, there might be caveats which we are presently
unaware of and render the whole {\bf Master Constraint Programme} obsolete.
Thus, this paper should really be viewed as a proposal only, rather than a
presentation of hard results, which however we intend to supply in future

Another derivation is based on a formal analogy with the phase shift induced by
the magnetic potential for charged particles travelling in a region where a
constant vector potential is present: this is the so called Aharonov-Bohm
effect. Both derivations are carried out in a fully relativistic context, using
a suitable 1+3 splitting that allows us to recognize and define the space where

roughly $1 {\rm TeV}$ and $3-10 {\rm TeV}$, respectively. The implications of
this very early unification is the existence of new quarks and leptons with
charges up to 4/3 (for quarks) and 2 (for leptons) and masses $\ord(250\gev)$.
Interestingly, in these models the rare decay $K_L\to \mu e$ is automatically
absent at tree level and the one-loop contributions are consistent with the
experimental upper bound for this decay.

to choose freely an arbitrary gauge condition with respect to a gauge
transformation of the electromagnetic potentials. The Lorenz gauge condition
allows for the derivation of the inhomogeneous potential wave equations (IPWE),
but this also means that scalar derivatives of the electromagnetic potentials
are considered to be \emph{unphysical}. However, these scalar expressions might
have the meaning of a new physical field, $\mathsf S$. If this is the case,
then a generalised CED is required such that scalar field effects are predicted
and such that experiments can be performed in order to verify or falsify this
generalised CED. The IPWE are viewed as a generalised Gauss law and a
generalised Ampe\`re law, that also contain derivatives of $\mathsf S$, after
reformulating the IPWE in terms of fields.
  Some recent experiment show positive results that are in qualitative
agreement with the presented predictions of scalar field effects, but further
quantitative tests are required in order to verify or falsify the presented
theory. The importance of Nikola Tesla's pioneering research, with respect to
the predicted effects, cannot be overstated.

describing the main dynamical features of a discrete 2D cellular fault zone,

rheology, property disorder, and fault geometry. Depending on the location in
the system parameter space we show that the coarse dynamics of the fault can be
confined to an attractor whose dimension is significantly smaller than the
space in which the dynamics takes place. Our strategy of system reduction is to
search for a few coherent structures that dominate the dynamics and to capture
the interaction between these coherent structures. The identification of the
basic interacting structures is obtained by applying the Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD) to the surface deformations fields that accompany
strike-slip faulting accumulated over equal time intervals. We use a
feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) architecture for the
identification of the system dynamics projected onto the subspace (model space)
spanned by the most energetic coherent structures. The ANN is trained using a
standard back-propagation algorithm to predict (map) the values of the observed

vestibular system in which calcite particles called otoconia interfere with the
mechanical functioning of the fluid-filled semicircular canals normally used to
sense rotation. Using hydrodynamic models, we examine the two mechanisms
proposed by the medical community for BPPV: cupulolithiasis, in which otoconia
attach directly to the cupula (a sensory membrane), and canalithiasis, in which
otoconia settle through the canals and exert a fluid pressure across the
cupula. We utilize known hydrodynamic calculations and make reasonable
geometric and physical approximations to derive an expression for the
transcupular pressure $\Delta P_c$ exerted by a settling solid particle in
canalithiasis. By tracking settling otoconia in a two-dimensional model
geometry, the cupular volume displacement and associated eye response
(nystagmus) can be calculated quantitatively. Several important features
emerge: 1) A pressure amplification occurs as otoconia enter a narrowing duct;
2) An average-sized otoconium requires approximately five seconds to settle
through the wide ampulla, where $\Delta P_c$ is not amplified, which suggests a
mechanism for the observed latency of BPPV; and 3) An average-sized otoconium
beginning below the center of the cupula can cause a volumetric cupular
displacement on the order of 30 pL, with nystagmus of order $2^\circ$/s, which
is approximately the threshold for sensation. Larger cupular volume
displacement and nystagmus could result from larger and/or multiple otoconia.

the last section of this article -- devoted to experiments and new ideas
related to quantum information processing (QIP) with trapped ions -- the
realization of various quantum channels using a hyperfine qubit of Yb+ is
briefly discussed. Then a concept for QIP with trapped ions is reviewed where
rf or microwave radiation is used instead of laser light for coherent
manipulation of a collection of ions. In a suitably modified trap the ions form
an artificial ion ""molecule"" to which the techniques developed in nuclear
magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance experiments can be directly
applied. Finally, coherent excitation of optical electric quadrupole
transitions in Yb+ and Ba+ is reported. In addition, robust Raman cooling of a
pair of Ba+ ions is reviewed.

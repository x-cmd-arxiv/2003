  Such fields cannot be generated in a causally disconnected, hydrodynamically

large scale, dynamically dominant, magnetic fields are present in the outflow
from the very beginning, provide a natural explanation of this large reported
linear polarization. We derive Stokes parameters of synchrotron emission of a
relativistically moving plasma with a given magnetic field configuration and
calculate the pulse averaged polarization fraction of the emission from a
relativistically expanding shell carrying global toroidal magnetic field. For
viewing angles larger than $1/\Gamma$ the observed patch of the emitting shell
has almost homogeneous magnetic field, producing a large fractional
polarization ($56% $ for a power-law energy distribution of relativistic
particles $dn/d\epsilon \propto \epsilon^{-3}$). The maximum polarization is
smaller than the theoretical upper limit for a stationary plasma in uniform
magnetic field due to relativistic kinematic effects.

compare it with the harder, primarily CV, population of low-luminosity X-ray
sources with 10^31<L_X<10^32.5 ergs/s. The radial distribution of our qLMXB
sample suggests an average system mass of 1.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2} Msun, consistent
with a neutron star and low-mass companion. Spectral analysis reveals that no
globular cluster qLMXBs, other than the transient in NGC 6440, require an
additional hard power-law component as often observed in field qLMXBs. We
identify an empirical lower luminosity limit of 10^32 ergs/s among globular
cluster qLMXBs. The bolometric luminosity range of qLMXBs implies (in the deep
crustal heating model of Brown and collaborators) low time-averaged mass
transfer rates, below the disk stability criterion. The X-ray luminosity
functions of the CV populations alone in NGC 6397 and 47 Tuc are shown to
differ. The distribution of qLMXBs among globular clusters is consistent with
their dynamical formation by either tidal capture or exchange encounters,
allowing us to estimate that seven times more qLMXBs than bright LMXBs reside
in globular clusters. The distribution of harder sources (primarily CVs) has a
weaker dependence upon density than that of the qLMXBs. Finally, we discuss
possible effects of core collapse and globular cluster destruction upon X-ray

bands containing one peak and little temporal fluctuation other than the
expected Poisson variation. Such a burst offers the best chance for a unified
understanding of the gamma-ray burst and afterglow emissions. We provide a
detailed modeling of the observed radiation from GRB 021211 both during the
burst and the afterglow phase. The consistency between early optical emission
(prior to 11 minutes), which presumably comes from reverse shock heating of the
ejecta, and late afterglow emission from forward shock (later than 11 minutes)
requires the energy density in the magnetic field in the ejecta, expressed as
fraction of the equipartition value or $\epsilon_B$, to be larger than the
forward shock at 11 minutes by a factor of about 10$^3$. We find that the only
consistent model for the gamma-ray emission in GRB 021211 is the synchrotron
radiation in the forward shock; to explain the peak flux during the GRB
requires $\epsilon_B$ in forward shock at deceleration to be larger than the
value at 11 minutes by a factor of about 10$^2$.
  These results suggest that the magnetic field in the reverse shock and early
forward shock is most likely frozen-in-field from the explosion, and therefore
a large fraction of the energy in the explosion was initially stored in
magnetic field. We can rule out the possibility that the ejecta from the burst
for GRB 021211 contained more than 10 electron-positron pairs per proton.

1+1D vertical structure model in which the scattering properties of the dust
can be varied. Models are presented with and without dust scattering, and for
different albedos and phase functions. It is found that scattering has the
effect of reducing the disk temperature at all heights, so that the disk
""shrinks"", i.e., the the density at all intermediate heights decreases.
However, this effect in most cases is more than compensated by the increase of
the total extinction (absorption + scattering) cross section, so that the
surface scale height increases, and images in scattered light will see a
slightly thicker disk. The integrated infrared emission decreases as the albedo
increases, because an increasing part of the flux captured by the disk is
reflected away instead of absorbed and reprocessed. The reduction of the
infrared thermal emission of the disk is stronger at short wavelengths (near
infrared) and practically negligible at millimeter wavelengths. For relatively
low albedo (alb <~ 0.5), or for strongly forward-peaked scattering (g roughly
>0.8), the infrared flux reduction is relatively small.

We start by discussing the physical meaning of a varying $c$, dispelling the
myth that the constancy of $c$ is a matter of logical consistency. We then
summarize the main VSL mechanisms proposed so far: hard breaking of Lorentz
invariance; bimetric theories (where the speeds of gravity and light are not
the same); locally Lorentz invariant VSL theories; theories exhibiting a color
dependent speed of light; varying $c$ induced by extra dimensions (e.g. in the
brane-world scenario); and field theories where VSL results from vacuum
polarization or CPT violation. We show how VSL scenarios may solve the
cosmological problems usually tackled by inflation, and also how they may
produce a scale-invariant spectrum of Gaussian fluctuations, capable of
explaining the WMAP data. We then review the connection between VSL and
theories of quantum gravity, showing how ``doubly special'' relativity has
emerged as a VSL effective model of quantum space-time, with observational
implications for ultra high energy cosmic rays and gamma ray bursts. Some
recent work on the physics of ``black'' holes and other compact objects in VSL
theories is also described, highlighting phenomena associated with spatial (as
opposed to temporal) variations in $c$. Finally we describe the observational
status of the theory. The evidence is currently slim -- redshift dependence in
the atomic fine structure, anomalies with ultra high energy cosmic rays, and
(to a much lesser extent) the acceleration of the universe and the WMAP data.
The constraints (e.g. those arising from nucleosynthesis or geological bounds)
are tight, but not insurmountable. We conclude with the observational
predictions of the theory, and the prospects for its refutation or vindication.

have (U-B) colors redder than their red giant progenitors. This red incursion
is not expected on theoretical grounds, as horizontal branch stars (whose
convective regions are less extended than in red giant structures) should not
``appear'' cooler than a red giant. Analyzing data from different telescopes we
show that: 1) the horizontal branch red incursion is strongly dependent on the
shape of the adopted U filter and to a lesser extent, on the B filter; 2) the
photometry done with U filters which do not encompass the Balmer jump, do not
show the blue horizontal branch red incursion; 3) the occurrence of this

stars effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity; 4) theoretical tracks
can reproduce the observed horizontal branch morphology, provided that the

In particular, supernovae of type Ia are considered to arise from exploding

Comparison between theoretical prediction and observations of supernova rates

spark-associated subbeams of subpulse emission circulate around the magnetic
axis due to the EB drift, provides a natural and plausible physical mechanism
of the subpulse drift phenomenon. Recent progress in the analysis of drifting
subpulses in pulsars has provided a strong support to this model by revealing a
number of subbeams circulating around the magnetic axis in a manner compatible
with theoretical predictions. However, a more detailed analysis revealed that
the circulation speed in a pure vacuum gap is too high when compared with
observations. Moreover, some pulsars demonstrate significant time variations of
the drift rate, including a change of the apparent drift direction, which is
obviously inconsistent with the EB drift scenario in a pure vacuum gap. We
resolved these discrepancies by considering a partial flow of iron ions from
the positively charged polar cap, coexisting with the production of outflowing
electron-positron plasmas. By fitting the observationally deduced drift-rates
to the theoretical values, we managed to estimate polar cap surface
temperatures in a number of pulsars. The estimated surface temperatures
correspond to a small charge depletion of the order of a few percent of the
corotational charge density. We also argue that if the thermionic electron
outflow from the surface of a negatively charged polar cap is slightly below
the Goldreich-Julian density, then the resulting small charge depletion will
have similar consequences as in the case of the ions outflow. We thus believe
that the sparking discharge of a partially shielded acceleration potential drop
occurs in all pulsars, with both positively (``pulsars'') and negatively
(``anti-pulsars'') charged polar caps.

extension of the QED3 theory of the pseudogap phase into the superconducting
region. The theory predicts a single dSC-SDW transition, which may be
fluctuation induced first order, without the region of coexistence between the
two ordered phases. We compute the spin-spin correlator in the dSC, and explain
the evolution of the spin response with frequency as observed in neutron
scattering experiments on YBCO. We predict that at the frequencies much below
the resonance the (weak) spin response should become narrowly peaked at four
`diagonally' incommensurate wave vectors that span between the nodes of the
supercopnducting order parameter. These peaks represent an inherent collective
mode of the phase fluctuating dSC, the condensation of which would bring about
the SDW order in the pseudogap phase. Our interpretation of the resonance
suggests it should become more elusive in the superconductors with lower Tc, in
accord with its' conspicuous absence in LSCO.

oxygen depletion, $0.03\le\delta\le0.12$. Appearance of weak random magnetism
over entire crystal volume has been revealed by a slow exponential relaxation.
The absence of $\delta$-dependence for the random magnetism and the multiplet
pattern of muon Knight shift at higher fields strongly suggest that the random
moments are associated with excited Pr$^{3+}$ ions under crystal electric
field.

We first review
the derivation of the consistent boundary conditions (BC's) from the action
principle. These BC's include choices that give rise to breaking of the gauge
symmetries. The boundary conditions could be chosen to coincide with those
commonly applied in orbifold theories, but there are many more possibilities.
To investigate the nature of gauge symmetry breaking via BC's we calculate the
elastic scattering amplitudes for longitudinal gauge bosons. We find that using
a consistent set of BC's the terms in these amplitudes that explicitly grow
with energy always cancel without having to introduce any additional scalar
degree of freedom, but rather by the exchange of Kaluza--Klein (KK) gauge
bosons. This suggests that perhaps the SM Higgs could be completely eliminated
in favor of some KK towers of gauge fields. We show that from the low-energy
effective theory perspective this seems to be indeed possible. We display an
extra dimensional toy model, where BC's introduce a symmetry breaking pattern
and mass spectrum that resembles that in the standard model.

MC@NLO is a method for matching next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD calculations

fully exclusive events are generated, with hadronisation according to the MC
model; total rates are accurate to NLO; NLO results for distributions are
recovered upon expansion in $\as$; hard emissions are treated as in NLO
computations while soft/collinear emissions are handled by the MC simulation,
with the same logarithmic accuracy as the MC; matching between the hard and
soft regions is smooth, and no intermediate integration steps are necessary.
The method was applied previously to the hadroproduction of gauge boson pairs,
which at NLO involves only initial-state QCD radiation and a unique colour
structure. In heavy flavour production, it is necessary to include
contributions from final-state QCD radiation and different colour flows. We
present illustrative results on top and bottom production at the Tevatron and

idempotents for a finite group $G$ and deduce from them geometric information
about the components that appear in the decomposition of the Jacobian variety
of a curve with $G-$action.
  We give an algorithm to find explicit primitive rational idempotents for any

These explicit constructions allow geometric descriptions of the factors
appearing in the decomposition of a Jacobian with group action: from them we
deduce the decomposition of any Prym or Jacobian variety of an intermediate
cover, in the case of a Jacobian with $G-$action. In particular, we give a
necessary and sufficient condition for a Prym variety of an intermediate cover
to be such a factor.

passed through a vacuum degasser (in the light water system) or a membrane
contact degasser (in the heavy water system) where dissolved gases, including
radon, are liberated. The degasser is connected to a vacuum system which
collects the radon on a cold trap and removes most other gases, such as water
vapor and nitrogen. After roughly 0.5 tonnes of H2O or 6 tonnes of D2O have
been sampled, the accumulated radon is transferred to a Lucas cell. The cell is
mounted on a photomultiplier tube which detects the alpha particles from the
decay of 222Rn and its daughters. The overall degassing and concentration
efficiency is about 38% and the single-alpha counting efficiency is
approximately 75%. The sensitivity of the radon assay system for D2O is
equivalent to ~3 E(-15) g U/g water. The radon concentration in both the H2O
and D2O is sufficiently low that the rate of background events from U-chain
elements is a small fraction of the interaction rate of solar neutrinos by the
neutral current reaction.

nucleus. Experimental confirmation of new features predicted here for the
suggested reaction would advance our understanding of hard nuclear reactions. A
main prediction, in contrast with low-energy observations, is that the $pp$
breakup cross section is not much smaller than the one for $pn$ break up.In
some models, the energy-dependent oscillations observed for $pp$ scattering are
predicted to appear in the $\gamma ^3{\rm He} \to p p + n$ reaction. Such an
observation would open up a completely new field in studies of color coherence
phenomena in hard nuclear reactions. We also demonstrate that, in addition to
the energy dependence, the measurement of the light-cone momentum distribution
of the recoil neutron provides an independent test of the underlying dynamics
of hard disintegration.

  clarified, minor revisions","Astron.J.129:1706-1717,2005","10.1086/427962",,"astro-ph",,"  Precise radial velocity measurements have led to the discovery of ~100
extrasolar planetary systems. We investigate the uncertainty in the orbital
solutions that have been fit to these observations. Understanding these
uncertainties will become more and more important as the discovery space for
extrasolar planets shifts to longer and longer periods. While detections of
short period planets can be rapidly refined, planets with long orbital periods
will require observations spanning decades to constrain the orbital parameters
precisely. Already in some cases, multiple distinct orbital solutions provide
similarly good fits, particularly in multiple planet systems. We present a
method for quantifying the uncertainties in orbital fits and addressing
specific questions directly from the observational data rather than relying on
best fit orbital solutions. This Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique has
the advantage that it is well suited for the high dimensional parameter spaces
necessary for the multiple planet systems. We apply the MCMC technique to
several extrasolar planetary systems, assessing the uncertainties in orbital
elements for several systems. Our MCMC simulations demonstrate that for some
systems there are strong correlations between orbital parameters and/or
significant non-Gaussianities in parameter distributions, even though the
measurement errors are nearly Gaussian. Once these effects are considered the
actual uncertainties in orbital elements can be significantly larger or smaller
than the published uncertainties. We also present simple applications of our
methods such as predicting the times of possible transits for GJ 876.

employ an N-body treatment of the stars and dark matter, together with an SPH

active. The results indicate that for such impact geometries, collisions can
lead to the very rapid formation of a central, rapidly rotating, dense gas
disk, and that in all cases extensive star formation is predicted by the very
high gas densities and prevalence of shocks, both in the nucleus and out in the
galactic disks. As the dense nucleus is forming, gas and stars are dispersed
over very large volumes, and only fall back towards the nucleus over long
times. In the case of low impact velocities, this takes an order of magnitude
more time than that needed for the formation of a dense nucleus.

applied to study the physical evolution along the Z-track which remains a major
problem. This model consists of blackbody emission from the neutron star plus
Comptonized emission from an extended accretion disk corona. As found in
earlier work, major changes take place in the neutron star blackbody emission
with kT increasing in flaring, and the blackbody radius R_BB increasing
substantially to a maximum value of 9.4 +/- 0.6 km, consistent with the radius
of the neutron star, after which R_BB decreases. Thus this result is a
measurement of neutron star radius. The behaviour of Sco X-1 in flaring is
compared with our previous results for the strong flaring that takes place in
the bright dipping, flaring LMXB X 1624-490. Remarkably, during movement along
the Normal Branch towards the apex with the Flaring Branch, the luminosities of
both spectral components decrease, suggesting the possibility that Mdot may
decrease on the Normal Branch, contrary to the widely-held view that Mdot
increases monotonically along the Z-track. During flaring, we detect for the
first time an increase of the Comptonization cut-off energy which may suggest
heating of the ADC plasma by the neutron star flare. The energy of a broad
Gaussian line at 6.4 keV does not change, but the intensity of the line
increases in flaring suggesting either an increase in ADC size in flaring or
the effects of irradiation by the neutron star.

brightness, stellar rotation period, planetary orbital inclination angle, and
planetary orbital period, and then estimate the total number of CEGPs that
Kepler will detect over its four year mission. The analysis shows that
intrinsic stellar variability of solar-like stars is a major obstacle to
detecting the reflected light from CEGPs. Monte Carlo trials are used to

relatively insensitive to bias. In one approach, we use path lengths between

ellipticals. This suggests an intimate connection between L_XP and both the old

for the galaxy mass M and star-formation rate SFR. We derive proportionality
constants 1.3E29 erg/s/Msol and 0.7E39 erg/s/(Msol/yr), which can be used to
estimate the old and young components from M and SFR, respectively. The
cumulative X-ray luminosity functions for the point sources have quite
different slopes for the spirals (gamma ~= 0.5-0.8) and ellipticals (gamma ~=
1.4), implying *the most luminous point sources dominate L_XP* for the spirals.
Most of the point sources have X-ray colors that are consistent with either
LMXBs or Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs a.k.a. IXOs) and we rule out
classical HMXBs (e.g. neutron-star X-ray pulsars) as contributing much to L_XP.
Thus, for spirals, the ULXs dominate L_XP. We estimate that >~20% of all ULXs
found in spirals originate from the older (pop II) stellar populations,
indicating that many of the ULXs that have been found in spiral galaxies are in
fact pop II ULXs, like those in elliptical galaxies. The linear dependence of
L_XP on the SFR argues for either a steepening in the X-ray luminosity function
of the young (pop I) X-ray source population at L_X >~10^(38.5-39) erg/s, or a
decreasing efficiency for producing all types of young X-ray point sources as

the profile showed broad wings and a deep central absorption. During egress the
equivalent width was much higher ($\sim$70 {\AA}) and the broad wings, which
extend to $\pm$ 300 km/s, were prominent. During eclipse totality the

clearly a weak-line T Tauri star by the usual criteria, is still accreting
matter from a circumstellar disk, and has a well-collimated bipolar jet. As the
knife-edge of the occulting matter passes across the close stellar environment

formation rate in the binary members may be responsible for this effect. In
most binary systems, the direction of orbital motion of the satellite coincides
with the direction of rotation of the main galaxy. Seven candidates for distant

evidence for the rapid evolution of the space density of M51-type galaxies with

a range of the boson-fermion coupling strength extending from strongly
repulsive to strongly attractive. Increasing boson-fermion repulsions drive the
system towards spatial separation of its components (``demixing''), whereas
boson-fermion attractions drive it towards implosion (``collapse''). The
dynamics of the system is treated in the experimentally relevant collisionless
regime by means of a Random-Phase approximation and the behavior of a
mesoscopic cloud under isotropic harmonic confinement is contrasted with that
of a macroscopic mixture at given average particle densities. In the latter
case the locations of both the demixing and the collapse phase transitions are
sharply defined by the same stability condition, which is determined by the
softening of an eigenmode of either fermionic or bosonic origin. In contrast,
the transitions to either demixing or collapse in a mesoscopic cloud at fixed
confinement and particle numbers are spread out over a range of boson-fermion
coupling strength, and some initial decrease of the frequencies of a set of
collective modes is followed by hardening as evidenced by blue shifts of most
eigenmodes. The spectral hardening can serve as a signal of the impending
transition and is most evident when the number of bosons in the cloud is
relatively large. We propose physical interpretations for these dynamical
behaviors with the help of suitably defined partial compressibilities for the
gaseous cloud under confinement.

superconductivity occur, and that it is driven by $undressing$ of the carriers
at the Fermi energy upon pairing. Indeed, experiments show that dressed hole
carriers in the normal state become undressed electron carriers in the
superconducting state. This leads to a description of superconductors as giant
atoms, where undressed time-reversed electrons are paired and propagate freely
in a uniform positive background. The pairing gap provides rigidity to the
wavefunction, and electrons in the giant atom respond to magnetic fields the
same way as electrons in diamagnetic atoms. We predict that there is an
electric field in the interior of superconductors and that the charge
distribution is inhomogeneous, with higher concentration of negative charge
near the surface; that the ground state of superconductors has broken parity
and possesses macroscopic spin currents, and that negative charge spills out

to infiltrate the network in any manner -- as is normally required to launch a
DDoS attack. Thus, we see this type of attack as a poor man's DDoS. Not only is
the attack easy to mount, but it is also almost impossible to trace back to the

destructive potential with (limited and contained) experimental results. We
illustrate the potential impact of our attack by describing how an attacker can

Either dm is coupled to heavy fermions (but if $mdm \lesssim 100$ MeV, an
asymmetry between the dm particle and antiparticle number densities is likely
to be required), or dm is coupled to a new light gauge boson U. The
(collisional) damping of light candidates is, in some circumstances, large
enough to be mentioned, but in most cases too small to generate a non linear
matter power spectrum at the present epoch that differs significantly from the

with $mdm \gtrsim O(GeV)$) turn out to be much less constrained. We finally

on the four-dimensional domain wall is proposed. The mechanism of light
particle trapping is accounted for by a strong self-interaction of
five-dimensional pre-quarks. We obtain the low-energy effective action which
exhibits the invariance under the so called \tau-symmetry. Then we find a set
of vacuum solutions which break that symmetry and the five-dimensional
translational invariance. One type of those vacuum solutions gives rise to the
domain wall formation with consequent trapping of light massive fermions and
Higgs-like bosons as well as massless sterile scalars, the so-called branons.
The induced relations between low-energy couplings for Yukawa and scalar field
interactions allow to make certain predictions for light particle masses and
couplings themselves, which might provide a signature of the higher dimensional
origin of particle physics at future experiments. The manifest translational
symmetry breaking, eventually due to some gravitational and/or matter fields in
five dimensions, is effectively realized with the help of background scalar
defects. As a result the branons acquire masses, whereas the ratio of Higgs and
fermion (presumably top-quark) masses can be reduced towards the values
compatible with the present-day phenomenology. Since the branons do not couple
to fermions and the Higgs bosons do not decay into branons, the latter ones are
essentially sterile and stable, what makes them the natural candidates for the
dark matter in the Universe.

semistability and stability coincide. This is useful even when G is nonabelian,

projectile residues from the collisions of 25 MeV/nucleon 86Kr projectiles on

process of N/Z equilibration occurring between the projectile and the target.
The logarithmic slopes $\alpha$ and $\beta^{'}$ of the residue yield ratios
with respect to residue neutron number N and neutron excess N--Z are obtained
as a function of the atomic number Z and mass number A, respectively, whereas
excitation energies are deduced from velocities. The relation of the isoscaling
parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta^{'}$ with the N/Z of the primary (excited)
projectile fragments is employed to gain access to the degree of N/Z
equilibration prior to fragmentation as a function of excitation energy. A
monotonic relation between the N/Z difference of fragmenting quasiprojectiles
and their excitation energy is obtained indicating that N/Z equilibrium is
approached at the highest observed excitation energies. Simulations with a
deep-inelastic transfer model are in overall agreement with the isoscaling
conclusions. The present residue isoscaling approach to N/Z equilibration
offers an attractive tool of isospin and reaction dynamics studies in
collisions involving beams of stable or rare isotopes.

increasing the energy spread and emittance of a beam, but also leading to a
potential instability. Previous studies of the CSR induced longitudinal
instability were carried out for the CSR impedance due to dipole magnets.
However, many storage rings include long wigglers where a large fraction of the
synchrotron radiation is emitted. This includes high-luminosity factories such
as DAPHNE, PEP-II, KEK-B, and CESR-C as well as the damping rings of future
linear colliders. In this paper, the instability due to the CSR impedance from
a wiggler is studied assuming a large wiggler parameter $K$. The primary
consideration is a low frequency microwave-like instability, which arises near
the pipe cut-off frequency. Detailed results are presented on the growth rate
and threshold for the damping rings of several linear collider designs.
Finally, the optimization of the relative fraction of damping due to the
wiggler systems is discussed for the damping rings.

for high photon number it fails to reproduce the true distribution. This is
contrasted with the fact that for moderate squeezing the WKB approximation
gives the analytical justification to the interpretation of the oscillations as
the result of the interference of areas with definite phases in phase space. It
is shown with a computation at high squeezing using a modified prescription for
the phase space representation which is based on Wigner-Cohen distributions

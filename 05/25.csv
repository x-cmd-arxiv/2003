saturated Lyman alpha absorptions. This property is established using the
``pseudo-hydro'' technique (Croft et al. 1998). It provides a constraint for
the inversion of the Lyman alpha forest, which encounters difficulty in the
saturated region. With a Gaussian density profile and the scaling relation, a
simple inversion of the simulated Lyman alpha forests shows that the
one-dimensional mass power spectrum is well recovered on scales above 2 Mpc/h,
or roughly k < 0.03 s/km, at z=3. The recovery underestimates the power on
small scales, but improvement is possible with a more sophisticated algorithm.

presence of the gluino mass. However, the renormalization of the supercurrent
can be realized in a scheme that restores the continuum supersymmetric WTi
(once the on-shell condition is imposed). The general procedure used to
calculate the renormalization constants and mixing coefficients for the local
supercurrent is presented. The supercurrent not only mixes with the gauge
invariant operator $T_\mu$. An extra mixing with other operators coming from
the WTi appears. This extra mixing survives in the continuum limit in the
off-shell regime and cancels out when the on-shell condition is imposed and the
renormalized gluino mass is set to zero. Comparison with numerical results are
also presented.

fields are linear in the quantum variables. This leads to linear Ward-Takahashi

this framework we derive the BFM for the N=2 Super-Yang-Mills theory in the

gauge theory. We obtain the background transformations for the full BRST

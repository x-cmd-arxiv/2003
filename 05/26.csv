moderate redshift z<1, what can be observed as temperature anisotropies in the

measurement of the ISW effect based on the angular cross-correlation function,
w_{TG}, of CMB temperature anisotropies and dark-matter fluctuations traced by
galaxies. We cross-correlate the first-year WMAP data in combination with the
APM Galaxy survey. On the largest scales, theta = 4-10 deg, we detect a
non-vanishing cross-correlation at 98.8 % significance level, with a 1-sigma
error of w_{TG} = 0.35 +/- 0.14 microK, which favors large values of
Omega_Lambda \simeq 0.8 for flat FRW models. On smaller scales, theta < 1deg,
the correlations disappear. This is contrary to what would be expected from the
ISW effect, but the absence of correlations may be simply explained if the ISW
signal was being cancelled by anti-correlations arising from the thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect.

masses will be derived in the near future. For the calculation of binary
frequency we restrict ourselves to systems with distances less than 20 pc.
After correction of the binaries bias, we find a ratio of visual binaries (at
the HST limit of detection) of around 10%, and that ~15% of the 26 objects
within 20 parsecs are binary systems with separations between 1 and 8 A.U. The
observed frequency of ultra-cool binaries is similar than that of binaries with
G-type primaries in the separation range from 2.1 A.U. to 140 A.U. There is
also a clear deficit of ultra-cool binaries with separations greater than 15
A.U., and a possible tendency for the binaries to have mass ratios near unity.
Most systems have indeed visual and near-infrared brightness ratios between 1

significantly from those calculated using MHD. This can be important in hot
accretion flows around compact objects. In this paper we study the transition
from the collisionless kinetic regime to the collisional MHD regime, mapping
out the dependence of the MRI growth rate on collisionality. A kinetic closure
scheme for a magnetized plasma is used that includes the effect of collisions
via a BGK operator. The transition to MHD occurs as the mean free path becomes
short compared to the parallel wavelength $2\pi/k_{\Par}$. In the weak magnetic
field regime where the Alfv\'en and MRI frequencies $\omega$ are small compared
to the sound wave frequency $k_{\Par} c_0$, the dynamics are still effectively
collisionless even if $\omega \ll \nu$, so long as the collision frequency $\nu
\ll k_{\Par} c_{0}$; for an accretion flow this requires $\nu \lsim \Omega
\sqrt{\beta}$. The low collisionality regime not only modifies the MRI growth
rate, but also introduces collisionless Landau or Barnes damping of long
wavelength modes, which may be important for the nonlinear saturation of the
MRI.

Entropy Method) is developed for nonequilibrium problems. This method enables
one to treat any complicated nonlinear functionals that fit best the physics of
a problem (such as, for example, rates of processes) as new independent
variables.
  The work of the method was demonstrated on the Boltzmann's--type kinetics.
New macroscopic variables are introduced (moments of the Boltzmann collision
integral, or scattering rates). They are treated as independent variables
rather than as infinite moment series. This approach gives the complete account
of rates of scattering processes. Transport equations for scattering rates are
obtained (the second hydrodynamic chain), similar to the usual moment chain
(the first hydrodynamic chain). Various examples of the closure of the first,
of the second, and of the mixed hydrodynamic chains are considered for the hard
spheres model. It is shown, in particular, that the complete account of
scattering processes leads to a renormalization of transport coefficients.
  The method gives the explicit solution for the closure problem, provides
thermodynamic properties of reduced models, and can be applied to any kinetic
equation with a thermodynamic Lyapunov function.

gravity with $\Lambda=0$, the continuum limit can only be achieved by fine
tuning the recurrence constant. We regard this failure as the implication that

cosmological constant term with the evolution of the universe. It turns out

calculation of the energy spectra and form factors (operator matrix elements in
the basis of Hamiltonian eigenstates) in exactly solvable quantum systems. As
examples we apply the theory to several models of current interest in the study
of Bose-Einstein condensates, which have been successfully created using
ultracold dilute atomic gases. The first model we introduce describes Josephson
tunneling between two coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. It can be used not
only for the study of tunneling between condensates of atomic gases, but for
solid state Josephson junctions and coupled Cooper pair boxes. The theory is
also applicable to models of atomic-molecular Bose-Einstein condensates, with
two examples given and analysed. Additionally, these same two models are
relevant to studies in quantum optics. Finally, we discuss the model of
Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer in this framework, which is appropriate for
systems of ultracold fermionic atomic gases, as well as being applicable for
the description of superconducting correlations in metallic grains with
nanoscale dimensions. In applying all of the above models to physical
situations, the need for an exact analysis of small scale systems is
established due to large quantum fluctuations which render mean-field
approaches inaccurate.

kaon angles, but our data shows a more complex s- and u- channel resonance
structure than previously seen. This structure is present at forward and
backward angles but not central angles, and its position and width change with
angle, indicating that more than one resonance is playing a role. Rising
back-angle cross sections at higher energies and large positive polarization at
backward angles are consistent with sizable s- or u-channel contributions. None
of the model calculations we present can consistently explain these aspects of
the data.

the cross sections are enhanced significantly and a much better agreement with

classical memory. In particular, we consider a setting where information about
a random n-bit string X is stored in r classical or quantum bits, for r<n,
i.e., the stored information is bound to be only partial. Later, a randomly
chosen binary question F about X is asked, which has to be answered using only
the stored information. The maximal probability of correctly guessing the
answer F(X) is then compared for the cases where the storage device is
classical or quantum mechanical, respectively.
  We show that, despite the fact that the measurement of quantum bits can
depend arbitrarily on the question F to be answered, the quantum advantage is
negligible already for small values of the difference n-r.
  An implication for cryptography is that privacy amplification by application
of a compression function mapping n-bit strings to s-bit strings (for some
s<n-r), chosen publicly from a two-universal class of hash functions, remains
essentially equally secure when the adversary's memory is allowed to be r
quantum rather than only r classical bits.

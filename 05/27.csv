We show that inhomogeneities in the ionization fraction, rather than in the

Depending on the ionization history and the clustering bias of the ionizing
sources, we find that rms temperature fluctuations range from 2 $\mu$K to 8
$\mu$K and the corresponding values for polarization are over two orders of
magnitude smaller. Reionization can significantly bias cosmological parameter
estimates and degrade gravitational lensing potential reconstruction from
temperature maps but not from polarization maps. We demonstrate that a simple
modeling of the reionization temperature power spectrum may be sufficient to
remove the parameter bias. The high-$\ell$ temperature power spectrum will
contain some limited information about the sources of reionization.

rotating, solar metallicity AGB star of 3M_sun. Rotationally induced mixing
during the thermal pulses produces a layer (~2E-5M_sun) on top of the CO-core
where large amounts of protons and C12 co-exist. We follow the abundance
evolution in this layer, in particular that of the neutron source C13 and of
the neutron poison N14. In our AGB model mixing persists during the entire
interpulse phase due to the steep angular velocity gradient at the
core-envelope interface. We follow the neutron production during the interpulse
phase, and find a resulting maximum neutron exposure of tau_max =0.04 mbarn^-1,
which is too small to produce any significant s-process. In parametric models,
we then investigate the combined effects of diffusive overshooting from the
convective envelope and rotationally induced mixing. Models with overshoot and
weaker interpulse mixing - as perhaps expected from more slowly rotating stars
- yield larger neutron exposures. We conclude that the incorporation of
rotationally induce mixing processes has important consequences for the
production of heavy elements in AGB stars. Through a distribution of initial
rotation rates it may lead to a natural spread in the neutron exposures
obtained in AGB stars of a given mass - as appears to be required by
observations. Our results suggest that both processes, diffusive overshoot and
rotational mixing, may be required to obtain a consistent description of the
s-process in AGB stars which fulfils all observational constraints. Finally, we
find that mixing due to rotation within our current framework does increase the
production of N15 in the partial mixing zone, however still falling short of
what seems required by observations.

Mg24 are depleted by hot bottom burning (HBB) during the interpulse phase. As a
result, Na23, Mg25 and Mg26 are enhanced. If the HBB temperatures are
sufficiently high for this process to deplete oxygen efficiently, Na23 is first
produced and then depleted during the interpulse phase. Although the
simultaneous depletion of O16 and enhancement of Na23 is possible, the required

times in only 2 x 10^4 s. Since the spectrum in its bright phase was fitted

ubiquitous systems, such as those involving short-range interactions, markovian
processes, and, generally speaking, those systems whose dynamical occupancy of
phase space tends to be ergodic. For systems whose microscopic dynamics is more
complex, it is natural to expect that the dynamical occupancy of phase space
will have a less trivial structure, for example a (multi)fractal or
hierarchical geometry. The question naturally arises whether it is possible to
study such systems with concepts and methods similar to those of standard
statistical mechanics. The answer appears to be {\it yes} for ubiquitous
systems, but the concept of entropy needs to be adequately generalized. Some
classes of such systems can be satisfactorily approached with the entropy
$S_q=k\frac{1-\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1}$ (with $q \in \cal R$, and $S_1

heterostructures. These can be obtained by $\delta$-doping with Mn the GaAs
layers of a GaAs/AlAs superlattice. Our analysis spans a range of Mn
concentrations and considers the presence of compensating defects such as As
antisites.
  In the defect-free case all the heterostructures studied present an
half-metallic electronic structure. In contrast when As antisites are present
the half-metallic state is destroyed and the heterostructures behave as dirty
planar metals. In this case they show a large $p$-type metallic conductance in
the Mn plane mainly due to majority spin electrons, and an $n$-type
hopping-like conductance in the GaAs planes mainly due to minority spin
electrons. This suggests that if the As antisites can be kept far from the Mn
planes, spatial separation of the different spin currents can be achieved.
Finally we show that in the case of AlAs/(Ga,Mn)As digital ferromagnetic
heterostructures the AlAs/GaAs valence band offset produces an additional
confining potential for the holes responsible for the ferromagnetism. Therefore
the ferromagnetic coupling between the Mn ions becomes larger and more robust
to the presence of As antisites.

"cs/0305044","Marco Zaffalon","Gert de Cooman and Marco Zaffalon","Updating beliefs with incomplete observations","Replaced with extended version",,,,"cs.AI",,"  Currently, there is renewed interest in the problem, raised by Shafer in
1985, of updating probabilities when observations are incomplete. This is a
fundamental problem in general, and of particular interest for Bayesian
networks. Recently, Grunwald and Halpern have shown that commonly used updating
strategies fail in this case, except under very special assumptions. In this
paper we propose a new method for updating probabilities with incomplete
observations. Our approach is deliberately conservative: we make no assumptions
about the so-called incompleteness mechanism that associates complete with
incomplete observations. We model our ignorance about this mechanism by a
vacuous lower prevision, a tool from the theory of imprecise probabilities, and
we use only coherence arguments to turn prior into posterior probabilities. In
general, this new approach to updating produces lower and upper posterior
probabilities and expectations, as well as partially determinate decisions.
This is a logical consequence of the existing ignorance about the
incompleteness mechanism. We apply the new approach to the problem of
classification of new evidence in probabilistic expert systems, where it leads
to a new, so-called conservative updating rule. In the special case of Bayesian
networks constructed using expert knowledge, we provide an exact algorithm for
classification based on our updating rule, which has linear-time complexity for
a class of networks wider than polytrees. This result is then extended to the
more general framework of credal networks, where computations are often much
harder than with Bayesian nets. Using an example, we show that our rule appears
to provide a solid basis for reliable updating with incomplete observations,
when no strong assumptions about the incompleteness mechanism are justified.

introduce additional terms in the free energy of the corresponding matrix model

construct a class of solutions for the SU(2) Skyrme model. Though these
solutions are not solitonic, they provide us with an example on how the plane
wave solutions arise in nonlinear field theories. In this paper, we investigate
the applicability of the ansatz for the SU(3) Skyrme model. We explicitly
construct a class of solutions for the SU(3) model, which in the simplest
circumstance is reduced to a combination of the plane waves and Weierstrass
elliptic functions. We also discuss some properties of these solutions. For
example, the intrinsic structure of these solutions is found to describe an
asymmetrical top rotating in the complex three-dimensional space.

representations of the quantum algebra U_q(su_{1,1}), which may serve as
Hamiltonians of various physical systems. The problem of diagonalization of
these operators (eigenfunctions, spectra, overlap coefficients, etc.) is solved
by expressing their overlap coefficients in terms of the known families of
q-orthogonal polynomials. We consider both bounded and unbounded operators. In
the latter case they are not selfadjoint and have deficiency indices (1,1),
which means that they have infinitely many selfadjoint extensions. We find
possible sets of point spectrum (which depends on the representation space
under consideration) for one of such symmetric operators by using the
orthogonality relations for q-Laguerre polynomials. In another case we are led
to new orthogonality relations for {}_3\phi_1-hypergeometric polynomials. Many
new realizations for the discrete series representations are constructed, which
follows from the diagonalization of the operators considered. In particular, a
new system of orthogonal functions on a discrete set is shown to emerge.

the author claimed some surprising connections among these seemingly unrelated

2q times where q is a prime power, then for any c_1,...,c_k in Z/qZ there
exists a subset I of {1,...,k} such that sum_{s in I}1/n_s=q and sum_{s in

value c=-q. For certain parameter regimes the corresponding recurrence relation
can be related to a symmetric operator on the Hilbert space l^2(Z). The
operator has deficiency indices (1,1) and we describe as explicitly as possible
the spectral resolutions of the self-adjoint extensions. This gives rise to
one-parameter orthogonality relations for sums of two 2\phi1-series. In
particular, we find that the Ismail-Zhang q-analogue of the exponential
function satisfies certain orthogonality relations analogous to the Fourier
cosine transform.

the nonlinearity in the relativistic models automatically yields contributions
in the form of a weak density dependence not only in the central potential but
also in the spin-orbit potential. The central potential affects the bulk and
surface properties while the spin-orbit potential is crucial for the shell
structure of finite nuclei. A modification in the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock model

realm to accomplish tasks that are otherwise impossible in the classical domain
[1]. Although sufficient conditions have been formulated for the physical
resources required to achieve quantum computation and communication [2], there
is an evolving understanding of the power of quantum measurement combined with
conditional evolution for accomplishing diverse tasks in quantum information
science [3-5]. In this regard, a significant advance is the invention of a
protocol by Duan, Lukin, Cirac, and Zoller (DLCZ) [6] for the realization of
scalable long distance quantum communication and the distribution of
entanglement over quantum networks. Here, we report the first enabling step in
the realization of the protocol of DLCZ, namely the observation of quantum
correlations for photon pairs generated in the collective emission from an
atomic ensemble. The nonclassical character of the fields is evidenced by the
violation of a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for the two fields (1,2). As compared
to prior investigations of nonclassical correlations for photon pairs produced
in atomic cascades [7] and in parametric down conversion [8], our experiment is
distinct in that the correlated (1,2) photons are separated by a programmable
time interval delta t, with delta t ~ 400 nsec in our initial experiments.

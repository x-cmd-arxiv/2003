quasar spectra arises from two sources (apart from occasional metals): one is
due to Lyman-alpha (Lya) absorption by materials at a low redshift, and the
other from Lyman-beta (Lyb) at a higher redshift. These two sources of
absorption are to a good approximation uncorrelated because of their wide
physical separation. Therefore, the two-point correlation of absorption in this
region of quasar spectra neatly factorizes into two pieces: the Lyb correlation
at high z, and the Lya correlation at low z. The latter can be independently
measured from quasar spectra at lower redshifts using current techniques. A
simple division then offers a way to statistically separate out the Lyb
two-point correlation from the Lya correlation. Several applications of this
technique are discussed. First, since the Lyb absorption cross-section is lower
than Lya by about a factor of 5, the Lyb forest is a better probe of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) at higher redshifts where Lya absorption is often
saturated. Second, for the same reason, the Lyb forest allows a better
measurement of the equation of state of the IGM at higher overdensities,
yielding stronger constraints on its slope when used in conjunction with the
Lya forest. Third, models of the Lya forest based on gravitational instability
make unique predictions for the Lyb forest, which can be tested against
observations. We briefly point out that feedback processes that affect higher
density regions but leave low density structure intact may be better
constrained by the Lyb forest.

that the latest-type spirals closely follow the correlation between molecular
gas content and galaxy luminosity established for earlier Hubble types. The
molecular gas in late-type galaxies seems to be less centrally concentrated
than in earlier types. We use Hubble Space Telescope optical images to
correlate the molecular gas mass to the properties of the central galaxy disk
and the compact star cluster that occupies the nucleus of most late-type

star cluster and the molecular gas mass, although the CO detection rate is
highest for the brightest clusters. It appears that the central surface
brightness of the stellar disk is an important parameter for the amount of

changing its shape and brightness. We observed bright blobs in the outer jet
moving away from the pulsar with apparent speeds (0.3-0.6)c and fading on
time-scales of days to weeks. The spectrum of the outer jet fits a power-law

interpreted as synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic electrons/positrons.
This interpretation allows one to estimate the magnetic field, ~100 microGauss,
maximum energy of X-ray emitting electrons, $2 \times 10^{14}$ eV, and energy
injection rate, $8\times 10^{33}$ erg/s, for the outer jet. In the summed PWN

extreme bends closer to the pulsar, as well as the apparent side motions of the

confined, pinched jet flow. Another feature found in the summed image is a dim,
2'-long outer counter-jet, which also shows a power-law spectrum with photon
index of 1.2-1.5. Southwest of the jet/counter-jet (i.e., approximately
perpendicular to the direction of pulsar's proper motion), an extended region
of diffuse emission is seen. Relativistic particles responsible for this
radiation are apparently supplied by the outer jet.

context of the LCDM cosmogony. The ratio of disk-to-total maximum circular
velocity, vd/vt, depends mainly on the central disk surface density Sig_d (or
surface brightness, SB), increasing roughly as Sig_d^0.15. While a fraction of
high SB galaxies have a vd/vt ratio corresponding to the maximum disk solution,
the low SB are completely dark matter dominated. The trend is similar for the
models, although they have slightly smaller vd/vt ratios than observations. An
analysis of residuals of the vd/vt-Sig_d relation shows that vd/vt tends to
decrease as the galaxy is redder, more luminous (massive), and of earlier type.
The models allow us to explain the physics of these results, which imply a
connexion between halo structure and luminous properties. The estimated
dynamical-to-baryon mass and dynamical mass-to-light ratios at a given radius,
for observations and models, decrease with the SB and do not correlate with the
galaxy scale, contrary to what has been reported in previous works, based on
the analysis of rotation curve shapes. We discuss this difference and state the
importance to solve the controversy on whether the dark and luminous contents

dust continuum emission found in our initial report (Luhman et al. 1998), but
here with a sample that is twice as large. This result suggests that the
deficit is a general phenomenon affecting 4/5 ULIRGs. We present an analysis
using observations of generally acknowledged photodissociation region (PDR)
tracers ([CII], [OI] 63 and 145 um, and FIR continuum emission), which suggests
that a high UV flux G_o incident on a moderate density n PDR could explain the
deficit. However, comparisons with other ULIRG observations, including CO
(1-0), [CI] (1-0), and 6.2 um polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission,
suggest that high G_o/n PDRs alone cannot produce a self-consistent solution
that is compatible with all of the observations. We propose that non-PDR
contributions to the FIR continuum can explain the apparent [CII] deficiency.
Here, unusually high G_o and/or n physical conditions in ULIRGs as compared to
those in normal and starburst galaxies are not required to explain the [CII]
deficit. Dust-bounded photoionization regions, which generate much of the FIR
emission but do not contribute significant [CII] emission, offer one possible
physical origin for this additional non-PDR component. Such environments may
also contribute to the observed suppression of FIR fine-structure emission from
ionized gas and PAHs, as well as the warmer FIR colors found in ULIRGs. The
implications for observations at higher redshifts are also revisited.

suggest that dark matter is dominant in disks of bright unbarred galaxies at
2.2 disk scale lengths, the point of peak rotation for a pure exponential disk.
We test the hypothesis that the TF plane of barred high surface brightness
galaxies is offset from the mean TFR of unbarred galaxies, as might be expected
if barred galaxies are ``maximal'' in their inner parts. We use existing and
new TF data to search for basic structural differences between barred and
unbarred galaxies. Our new data consist of 2-dimensional Halpha velocity fields
derived from SparsePak integral field spectroscopy (IFS) and V,I-band CCD
images collected at the WIYN Observatory for 14 strongly barred galaxies. We
use WIYN/SparsePak (2-D) velocity fields to show that long-slit (1-D) spectra
yield reliable circular speed measurements at or beyond 2.2 disk scale lengths,
far from any influence of the bar. This enables us to consider line width
measurements from extensive TF surveys which include barred and nonbarred disks

luminosity, barred and unbarred galaxies have comparable structural and
dynamical parameters, such as peak velocities, scale lengths, or colors. In
particular, the location of a galaxy in the TF plane is independent of
barredness. In a global dynamical sense, barred and unbarred galaxies behave

missions may require interferometry for high spatial resolution, but given that
the first direct imaging missions will probably fit into a single launch
vehicle, the astrophysics of planet finding calls for a visible light
coronagraph as the first space mission to search for extrasolar terrestrial
planets. New coronagraphic techniques place the necessary dynamic range within
reach for detecting planets in reflected starlight.

been photo-ionized by the UV flux from the first stars and AGNs and heated to

between pressure and gravity, indicated that dark haloes of virial velocity
lower than Vevap ~ 11-13 km/s have lost most of their gas in a dynamical time.
We follow the continuous evaporation by a thermal wind during the period when
the ionizing flux was effective. We find that the critical virial velocity for
significant evaporation is significantly higher. For example, if the ionization
starts at z-ion=10 and is maintained until z=2, a mass loss of one e-fold
occurs in haloes of Vevap ~ 25 (or 35 km/s) for T ~ 10^4K (or 2x10^4K). Haloes
of Vevap ~ 21 km/s (or 29 km/s) lose one e-fold within the first Hubble time at
z=10. Any dwarf galaxies with virial velocities smaller than Vevap must have
formed their stars from a small fraction of their gas before z-ion, and then
lost the rest of the gas by photo-evaporation. This may explain the gas-poor,
low surface brightness dwarf spheroidal galaxies. By z<1, most of the IGM gas
was evaporated at least once form dwarf galaxies, thus providing a lower bound
to its metallicity.

have constructed dynamical models of ESO 566-24 in order to understand the

determined from near-infrared photometry, and the gas dynamics is modelled as
inelastically colliding particles. The resulting morphology and kinematics with
different assumed pattern speeds, disk vertical thicknesses and dark halo
contributions is compared with observations. Our models can reproduce the main
morphological features of this galaxy: the four-armed spiral, and the inner and
nuclear rings. The pattern speed of the bar in this galaxy is such that the
corotation resonance is well outside the bar radius, the resonance radius is
1.6 +/- 0.3 times the bar radius. The four-armed spiral resides in the region
between inner and outer 4/1-resonances. Also, the main kinematical features,
including bar-induced deviations from circular rotation, are explained by our
models. The best fit is obtained when the dark halo contribution is just enough
to make the modelled rotation curve match the observed one. This ``minimum
halo'' is rather moderate: luminous matter dominates the rotation curve within

for the angular momentum loss, we find that most of the systems have not yet
completed a significant fraction of their PCEB life time. We therefore predict
the existence of a large population of old PCEBs containing cold white dwarfs
(T_eff<15000 K). Our calculations show that nearly half of the PCEBs in our
sample will evolve into a semi-detached configuration and start mass transfer
in less than the Hubble-time. These systems are thus representative for
progenitors of the current CV population. Only one of them (V471 Tau) will
evolve into a long-period (Porb>4h) CV, and a significant fraction of the
systems will start mass transfer in the period gap. Having estimated the
distances of the PCEBs in the sample, we derive a space density of ~6-30x1e-6
[pc-3], depending on the assumed angular momentum loss prescription. Taking
into account the evolutionary time scales we compute a lower limit for the CV
space density, predicted by the currently known PCEB population of ~10 x 1e-5

conclude that the observed PCEB population is probably highly incomplete.

A formula is found yielding the complete RSB solution for all overlaps. Since
our saddle-point equations for the effective action contain both the MP

characterization, in terms of intuitionistic logic, of answer sets which are

is the supervision system, which is responsible for configuring, coordinating,
controlling and monitoring the many hundreds of processes running in the HLT. A
prototype implementation of the supervision system, using tools from the ATLAS

relevant for the interiors of compact stars. At these densities, electrically
neutral and weak-equilibrated quark matter can have unequal numbers of up,
down, and strange quarks. The QCD interaction favors Cooper pairs that are
antisymmetric in color and in flavor, and a crystalline color superconducting
phase can occur which accommodates pairing between flavors with unequal number
densities. In the crystalline color superconductor, quarks of different flavor
form Cooper pairs with nonzero total momentum, yielding a condensate that
varies in space like a sum of plane waves. Rotational and translational
symmetry are spontaneously broken. We use a Ginzburg-Landau method to evaluate
candidate crystal structures and predict that the favored structure is
face-centered-cubic. We predict a robust crystalline phase with gaps comparable
in magnitude to those of the color-flavor-locked phase that occurs when the
flavor number densities are equal. Crystalline color superconductivity will be
a generic feature of the QCD phase diagram, occurring wherever quark matter
that is not color-flavor locked is to be found. If a very large flavor
asymmetry forbids even the crystalline state, single-flavor pairing will occur;
we investigate this and other spin-one color superconductors in a survey of
generic color, flavor, and spin pairing channels. Our predictions for the
crystalline phase may be tested in an ultracold gas of fermionic atoms, where a
similar crystalline superfluid state can occur. If a layer of crystalline quark
matter occurs inside of a compact star, it could pin rotational vortices,
leading to observable pulsar glitches.

trivial solitons (which correspond, respectively, to the spinor and
antisymmetric tensor representations of O(2N)), there are also threshold bound
states of a kink and a topologically trivial soliton: the heavier topological
solitons (HTS). The mass of any of these newly discovered HTS's is the sum of
masses of its solitonic constituents, and it corresponds to the tensor product
of their O(2N) representations. Thus, it is marginally stable (at least in the
large $N$ limit). Furthermore, its mass is independent of the distance between
the centers of its constituents, which serves as a flat collective coordinate,
or a modulus. There are no additional stable static solitons in the Gross-Neveu

confinement. In this paper we analyze the stability of the solitary-wave

self-focusing solutions of NPSE are precisely the 3D bright solitons
experimentally found in Bose-Einstein condensates [Nature {\bf 417}, 150

generalize the ones obtained with the standard nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation

direction. We prove that neither cubic nor cubic-quintic approximations of NPSE
are able to reproduce the unstable branch of the solitary-wave solutions.
Moreover, we show that the analitically found critical point of NPSE is in
remarkable good agreement with recent numerical computations of 3D GPE. We also
discuss the formation of multiple solitons by a sudden change of the sign of
the nonlinear strength. This formation can be interpreted in terms of the
modulational instability of the time-dependent macroscopic wave function of the

exponentially unstable if the curvature is negative and stable if it is

one responsible for stabilizing the stochastic Kapitsa pendulum. When the mean
curvature is negative it is capable of stabilizing the photon trajectories;
when the mean curvature is zero or positive it determines the characteristic
frequency with which neighbouring trajectories oscillate about each other. In
constant negative curvature models of the Universe that have compact topology,
exponential instability implies chaos (e.g. mixing) in the photon dynamics. We
discuss some consequences of stochastic stabilization in this context.

theoretical approach, to neglect without lost of accuracy, the otherwise
important ionization-dissociation competition. Abel transformation relates the
dissociation probability starting from a single ro-vibrational state, to the
probability of observing a hydrogen atom at a given pixel of the detector
plate. Some statistics on initial ro-vibrational distributions, together with a
spatial averaging over laser focus area, lead to photofragments kinetic
spectra, with well separated peaks attributed to single vibrational levels. An
excellent theory-versus-experiment agreement is reached not only for the

transfer from extra dimensions to ordinary dimensions through collisions
between KK modes, in particular, within clumps of KK modes. The possible scales

special purpose hardware that efficiently calculates gravitational forces and
potentials in $N$-body simulations. In addition to the gravitational
calculations, GRAPE simultaneously constructs the lists of neighbor particles
that are necessary for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). However, data
transfer of the neighbor lists from GRAPE to the host computer is time
consuming, and can be a bottleneck. In fact, the data transfer can take about
the same time as the calculations of forces themselves. Making use of GRAPE's
special treatment of neighbor lists, we can reduce the amount of data transfer
if we search neighbors in the order that the neighbor lists, constructed in a
single GRAPE run, overlap each other. We find that the Morton-ordering requires
very low additional calculation and programming costs, and results in
successful speed-up on data transfer. We show some benchmark results in the
case of GRAPE-5. Typical reduction in transferred data becomes as much as 90%.
This method is suitable not only for GRAPE-5, but also GRAPE-3 and the other
versions of GRAPE.

thereby establishing the minimum order required by the data. We apply this
method to the current supernova data, and with a prior -1 < w(z) < 1 and
Omega_m = 0.3 \pm 0.05, obtain a large probability of 91% for the cosmological
constant model, with the remaining 9% assigned to the two more complex models
tested. We also investigate the use of evidence for future supernova data sets
such as distances obtainable from surveys like the Supernova Acceleration Probe
(SNAP). Given a low uncertainty on the present day matter density we find that,
if the underlying dark energy model is only modestly evolving, then a constant
$w(z)$ fit is sufficient. However, if the evolution of the dark energy equation
of state to linear order is larger than |w_1| ~ 0.5, then the evolution can be
established with statistical significance. For models where we can assume the

matter distribution in the cluster core may offer insight into the structure
formation process. Unfortunately, cluster cores also tend to be the site of
complicated astrophysics. X-ray imaging spectroscopy of relaxed clusters, a
standard technique for mapping their dark matter distributions, is often
complicated by the presence of cool components in cluster cores, and the dark

the distribution of this component. In addition, fluctuations in the
temperature measurements resulting from normal statistical variance can produce
results which are unphysical. We present here a procedure for extracting the

for the r-process nucleosynthesis, we adopt the same models of the neutrino
luminosity in the neutrino-driven wind models of a 1.4 M_odot neutron star. We
find that the r-process nucleosynthesis is affected through the peak neutrino
luminosity, which depends on E_nu/tau_nu. We also discuss the unresolved

and the reconstructed shower core positions may lead to a systematic
miscalculation of some shower characteristics. Moreover, an accurate
determination of the shower core position for selected internal events is
important to reconstruct the primary direction using conical fits to the shower
front, improving the detector angular resolution, or to performe an efficient
gamma/hadron discrimination. In this paper we present a procedure able to
identify and reject showers with cores outside the ARGO-YBJ carpet boundaries.
A comparison of the results for gamma and proton induced showers is reported.

of ULXs is much higher than found in most normal spiral and elliptical
galaxies. Most of the X-ray sources and all seven of the ULXs in NGC 5194 are
located in, or close to, a spiral arm, suggesting a connection with recent star
formation. The cumulative luminosity function of the X-ray sources in NGC 5194
with Lx>10^38 erg/s is well described by a power law N(>Lx) \propto Lx^-\alpha
with \alpha=0.91. The X-ray spectra of most of the detected sources are
consistent with a power law with a photon index between 1 and 2, with a few
sources showing harder or softer spectra. The spectra of most ULXs are
consistent with both a power law and a multicolor disk blackbody (MCD) model,
while a power law model is preferable to a MCD model in two ULXs. A drastic
spectral variability and emission lines in ULXs are also presented. The masses
of the compact objects and mass accretion rates in ULXs and other X-ray sources

into account observational effects due to a finite beam-size. By constructing
an idealized set of simulated observations for a fiducial model, we forecast

$M(X,Y)$, from samples of random points distributed according to some joint
probability density $\mu(x,y)$. In contrast to conventional estimators based on
binnings, they are based on entropy estimates from $k$-nearest neighbour
distances. This means that they are data efficient (with $k=1$ we resolve
structures down to the smallest possible scales), adaptive (the resolution is
higher where data are more numerous), and have minimal bias. Indeed, the bias
of the underlying entropy estimates is mainly due to non-uniformity of the
density at the smallest resolved scale, giving typically systematic errors
which scale as functions of $k/N$ for $N$ points. Numerically, we find that
both families become {\it exact} for independent distributions, i.e. the
estimator $\hat M(X,Y)$ vanishes (up to statistical fluctuations) if $\mu(x,y)
= \mu(x) \mu(y)$. This holds for all tested marginal distributions and for all
dimensions of $x$ and $y$. In addition, we give estimators for redundancies
between more than 2 random variables. We compare our algorithms in detail with
existing algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our estimators
for assessing the actual independence of components obtained from independent
component analysis (ICA), for improving ICA, and for estimating the reliability
of blind source separation.

is also associated with an evolution of in-plane magnetic anisotropy, where the
multilayers change from uniaxial anisotropy to biaxial at t(TaN) around 4.0 nm
and above. We attribute the phenomena to the interlayer coupling effect of
FeTaN films as a function of the coupling layer (TaN) thickness, rather than to
the thickness dependence observed in single-layered FeTaN films, where the
direction of easy axis switches 90degrees when the film is thicker than 300 nm.
The in-plane anisotropy of the [(FeTaN)/(TaN)](n) multilayers also shows signs
of oscillation when the number of coupling layers varies. The MR effects
observed are mainly due to anisotropy MR (AMR), while the grain size and
exchange coupling may also contribute to the change of maximum MR ratios in the
multilayers with changing t(TaN).

eligible as a universal predictor in case of unknown mu. We investigate the
existence and convergence of computable universal (semi)measures for a
hierarchy of computability classes: finitely computable, estimable, enumerable,
and approximable. For instance, M is known to be enumerable, but not finitely
computable, and to dominate all enumerable semimeasures. We define seven
classes of (semi)measures based on these four computability concepts. Each
class may or may not contain a (semi)measure which dominates all elements of
another class. The analysis of these 49 cases can be reduced to four basic
cases, two of them being new. The results hold for discrete and continuous
semimeasures. We also investigate more closely the types of convergence,
possibly implied by universality: in difference and in ratio, with probability
1, in mean sum, and for Martin-Loef random sequences. We introduce a
generalized concept of randomness for individual sequences and use it to
exhibit difficulties regarding these issues.

observe a large quantity of devices with a reasonably short delay between

switches, tape libraries and other equipments. The monitoring activity should
not impact the performances of the system. In this paper we present PerfMC, a

collection. SNMP is a standard protocol implemented by many networked
equipments, so the tool can be used to monitor a wide range of devices. System
administrators can display informations on the status of each device by
connecting to a WEB server embedded in PerfMC. The WEB server can produce
graphs showing the value of different monitored quantities as a function of
time; it can also produce arbitrary XML pages by applying XSL Transformations
to an internal XML representation of the cluster's status. XSL Transformations
may be used to produce HTML pages which can be displayed by ordinary WEB
browsers. PerfMC aims at being relatively easy to configure and operate, and
highly efficient. It is currently being used to monitor the Italian
Reprocessing farm for the BaBar experiment, which is made of about 200 dual-CPU

mariners at rest with the submarine using an analogous reasoning for the fluid

  THJT002",,,,"hep-ex",,"  The traditional design of an HEP reconstruction system partitions the problem
into a series of modules. A reconstruction job is then just a sequence of
modules run in a particular order with each module reading data from the event
and placing new data into the event. The problem with such a design is it is up
to the user to place the modules in the correct order and CPU time is wasted
calculating quantities that may not be used if the event is rejected based on
some other criteria.
  The CLEO III analysis/reconstruction system takes a different approach: on
demand processing (otherwise known as lazy evaluation). Jobs are still
partitioned into smaller components which we call Producers. However, Producers
register what data they produce. The first time a datum is requested for an
event the Producer's algorithm is run. Sources work similarly, registering what
data they can retrieve but delaying retrieval until the data is requested. Data
analysis and filtering are done via a separate set of modules called
Processors.
  We have been using this system for four years and it has been a huge success.
The data access implementation has proven to be very easy to use and extremely
efficient. Reconstruction jobs are easy to configure and additional event
filters can be added efficiently and robustly -- access to correct data is
automatically guaranteed. The true test of success: physicists have embraced
this model for analysis even though the old model is still supported.

discovery by the BaBar Collaboration of a narrow state at 2.32 GeV, the
DsJ*(2317)+ that decays to Ds+pi0. Reconstructing the Ds+pi0 and Ds*+pi0 final
states in CLEO data, we observe peaks in both of the corresponding

dM(Ds*pi0)=M(Ds*pi0)-M(Ds*), both of them at values near 350 MeV. We interpret
these peaks as signatures of two distinct states, the DsJ*(2317)+ plus a new
state, designated as the DsJ(2463)+. Because of the similar dM values, each of
these states represents a source of background for the other if photons are
lost, ignored or added. A quantitative accounting of these reflections confirms
that both states exist. We have measured the mean mass differences <dM(Dspi0)>

$m_{Di}$, we calculate the masses $M_i$ and the mixing of the heavy neutrinos.
We confront the inferred properties of these neutrinos with the constraints
coming from the requirement of a successful baryogenesis via leptogenesis. In
the generic case the masses of the right-handed neutrinos are highly
hierarchical: $M_i \propto m_{Di}^2$; the lightest mass is $M_1 \approx 10^3 -
10^6$ GeV and the generated baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta_B\lesssim 10^{-14}$ is
much smaller than the observed value. We find the special cases which
correspond to the level crossing points, with maximal mixing between two
quasi-degenerate right-handed neutrinos. Two level crossing conditions are
obtained: ${m}_{ee}\approx 0$ (1-2 crossing) and $d_{12}\approx 0$ (2-3
crossing), where ${m}_{ee}$ and $d_{12}$ are respectively the 11-entry and the
12-subdeterminant of the light neutrino mass matrix in the basis where the
neutrino Yukawa couplings are diagonal. We show that sufficient lepton
asymmetry can be produced only in the 1-2 crossing where $M_1 \approx M_2

(super)conformal groups: their realization in the appropriate field theories in
Minkowski space with a Goldstone dilaton field and their realization as
(super)isometry groups of AdS (super)spaces. It exists already at the classical
level and maps the field variables and space-time coordinates of the given
(super)conformal field theory in $d$-dimensional Minkowski space ${\cal M}_d$
on the variables of a scalar codimension one (super)brane in AdS$_{d+1}$ in a
static gauge, the dilaton being mapped on the transverse AdS brane coordinate.
We explain the origin of this coordinate map and describe some its
implications, in particular, in $d=1$ models of conformal and superconformal
mechanics. We also give a suggestive geometric interpretation of this AdS/CFT
transform in the pure bosonic case in the framework of an extended
$2d+1$-dimensional conformal space involving extra coordinates associated with
the generators of dilatations and conformal boosts.

system was established by Denes Petz in 1996. In a recent paper he argued that
the scalar curvature of a statistically relevant - monotone - metric can be
interpreted as an average statistical uncertainty. The present paper
contributes to this subject. It is reasonable to expect that states which are
more mixed are less distinguishable than those which are less mixed. The
manifestation of this behavior could be that for such a metric the scalar
curvature has a maximum at the maximally mixed state. We show that not every
monotone metric fulfils this expectation, some of them behave in a very
different way. A mathematical condition is given for monotone Riemannian
metrics to have a local minimum at the maximally mixed state and examples are
given for such metrics.

general form of ERPA as compared with other similar theories in the sense that

(2) Fermi liquid decimation (FLD). The Brown-Rho scaling recently identified as
the parametric dependence intrinsic in the ""vector manifestation"" of hidden
local symmetry theory of Harada and Yamawaki results from the first decimation.
This scaling governs dynamics down to the scale at which the Fermi surface is
formed as a quantum critical phenomenon. The next decimation to the top of the
Fermi sea where standard nuclear physics is operative makes up the Fermi liquid
decimation. Thus nuclear dynamics is dictated by two fixed points, namely, the
vector manifestation fixed point and the Fermi liquid fixed point. It has been
a prevalent practice in nuclear physics community to proceed with the second
decimation only, assuming density independent masses. We show why most nuclear
phenomena can be reproduced by theories using either density-independent, or
density-dependent masses, a grand conspiracy of nature that is an aspect that
could be tied to the Cheshire-Cat phenomenon in hadron physics. We identify
what is left out in the Fermi liquid decimation that does not incorporate the
CSD. Experiments such as the dilepton production in relativistic heavy ion
reactions, which are specifically designed to observe effects of dropping
masses, could exhibit large effects from the reduced masses. However they are
compounded with effects that are not directly tied to chiral symmetry. We
discuss a recent STAR/RHIC observation where BR scaling can be singled out in a
pristine environment.

defined in the framework of classical, renormalized electrodynamics of
particles and fields, depends in an unstable way upon the field boundary data.
It is argued that this phenomenon may be also an origin of the unstable
dynamical behaviour of the system (i.e. existence of ""runaway solutions""). It
is proved that a suitable polarization mechanism of the particle restores the
stability, at least on the level of statics. Whether or not it restores also
the full, dynamical stability of the theory is still an open question.

generalized harmonic oscillator) and a quadratic system with an inverse-square
interaction up to N=2. Among the new features found, it is shown, for the
general quadratic system, that the shape of potential difference between the
original system and the transformed system could oscillate according to a
classical solution, which is related to the existence of coherent states in the
system.

Schrodinger currents follows by regarding these as the non-relativistic limits
of the Dirac and Klein-Gordon currents, respectively. The existence and
properties of further conserved vectors that are not functions of just the

clusters and argue that it is an excellent proxy for the total mass function if
the ratio f_b=M_b/M_tot in all clusters is close to its universal value,
Omega_b/Omega_M. Under this assumption, the baryon mass function can be used to
constrain the amplitude and slope of the density fluctuations power spectrum on
cluster scales. This method does not use observational determinations of the
total mass and thus bypasses major uncertainties in the traditional analyses
based on the X-ray temperature function. However, it is sensitive to possible
systematic variations of the baryon fraction as a function of cluster mass.
Adapting a weak dependence f_b(M) suggested by observations and numerical
simulations by Bialek et al., we derive sigma_8=0.72+-0.04 and the shape
parameter Omega_M*h=0.13+-0.07, in good agreement with a number of independent
methods. We discuss the sensitivity of these values to other cosmological
parameters and to different assumptions about variations in f_b.

The WMAP age constraint can also be shown to provide a stringent {\it lower

bound would require a global analysis of the WMAP parameter constraints.
However, making conservative assumptions about allowed parameter ranges and

red, absorption-dominated, passively-evolving galaxies have a larger clustering
scale length, r_0, and more prominent ``fingers of God'' than blue,
emission-line, actively star-forming galaxies. Intrinsically brighter galaxies
also cluster more strongly than fainter galaxies at z~1, with a significant

of evolution in the galaxy clustering within our survey volume and imply that

that our star-forming sample at z~1 has very similar selection criteria as the
Lyman-break galaxies at z~3 and that our red, absorption-line sample displays a
clustering strength comparable to the expected clustering of the Lyman-break

suggesting there are not many `degrees of freedom' in the observed spectra of

will be particularly valuable in making future comparisons between high and
low-redshift galaxy surveys for which very large spectroscopic samples are now
readily available, particularly when used in conjunction with high-resolution
spectral synthesis models which will be made public in the near future. We also
discuss the relative advantages of this approach to distant galaxy
classification compared to other methods such as colors and morphologies.
Finally, we compare the classification derived here with that adopted for the

similar. This will be particularly useful in subsequent analyses when making
comparisons between results from each of these surveys to study evolution in

last scattering and gravitational redshifts both at last scattering and along
the path to the observer. All of the primary anisotropy can be handled by
linear perturbation theory, which allows a very accurate calculation of the
predicted anisotropy from different models of the Universe.

  of the Solar Nebula","37 pages, 21 figures and 1 table. Accepted for publication in Icarus",,"10.1016/S0019-1035(03)00151-9",,"astro-ph",,"  The linear analysis of the instability due to vertical shear in the dust
layer of the solar nebula is performed. The following assumptions are adopted
throughout this paper: (1) The self-gravity of the dust layer is neglected. (2)
One fluid model is adopted, where the dust aggregates have the same velocity
with the gas due to strong coupling by the drag force. (3) The gas is
incompressible.
  The calculations with both the Coriolis and the tidal forces show that the
tidal force has a stabilizing effect. The tidal force causes the radial shear
in the disk. This radial shear changes the wave number of the mode which is at
first unstable, and the mode is eventually stabilized. Thus the behavior of the
mode is divided into two stages: (1) the first growth of the unstable mode
which is similar to the results without the tidal force, and (2) the subsequent
stabilization due to an increase of the wave number by the radial shear. If the
midplane dust/gas density ratio is smaller than 2, the stabilization occurs
before the unstable mode grows largely. On the other hand, the mode grows
faster by one hundred orders of magnitude, if this ratio is larger than 20.
  Because the critical density of the gravitational instability is a few
hundreds times as large as the gas density, the hydrodynamic instability
investigated in this paper grows largely before the onset of the gravitational
instability. It is expected that the hydrodynamic instability develops
turbulence in the dust layer and the dust aggregates are stirred up to prevent
from settling further. The formation of planetesimals through the gravitational
instabilities is difficult to occur as long as the dust/gas surface density
ratio is equal to that for the solar abundance.

spanning 1295 to 8440 MHz using the VLA in all four configurations. Here we
discuss the structure revealed in total intensity, spectral index,
polarization, and projected magnetic field. Our observations clearly reveal the
relation between the bright jets, radio source. The jets and rings form a
coherent structure with a dramatically flatter spectrum than the surrounding
lobes and bridge, strongly suggesting that they represent a recently renewed
outburst from the active nucleus. The spectrum of the lobes is also steeper
than in typical radio sources, and steepens further towards the centre. The
compact core is optically thin and also has a remarkably steep spectrum (alpha
\~ -1.2). There is some evidence that the old lobe material has been swept up
and compressed ahead of the new outburst. We interpret the dramatic asymmetry
in the bright structure, and more subtle differences between diffuse lobe
structures, in terms of relativistic beaming combined with front-to-back
light-travel delays which mean that we view the two lobes at different stages
of the outburst. After correcting for Faraday rotation the projected magnetic
field closely follows the edge of the lobes, the jets, and the rings; the field
pattern in the two lobes is broadly similar. We confirm a strong asymmetry in
depolarization and Faraday rotation, with the jet side the less depolarized and
the flatter spectrum, consistent with general correlations between these
asymmetries. The spectral index asymmetry is clearly present in the `old' lobe
material and so, at least in this case, is not due to beaming; but it can be
understood in terms of the light-travel delay.

$E_0(S)$ of {\it homogeneous} Heisenberg models. In the one-dimensional
antiferromagnetic case we propose an improved expression for $E_0(S)$, which
takes into account Bethe-Ansatz data for $S=1/2$. Next, we consider {\it
inhomogeneous} Heisenberg models (e.g., exposed to spatially varying external
fields). We prove a Hohenberg-Kohn-like theorem stating that in this case the
ground-state energy is a functional of the spin distribution, and that this
distribution encapsulates the entire physics of the system, regardless of the
external fields. Building on this theorem, we then propose a local-density-type
approximation that allows to utilize the results obtained for homogeneous
systems also in inhomogeneous situations. We conjecture a scaling law for the
dependence of the correlation functional on dimensionality, which is well
satisfied by existing numerical data. Finally, we investigate the importance of
the spin-correlation energy by comparing results obtained with the proposed
correlation functional to ones from an uncorrelated mean-field calculation,

T=0, which is accompanied by phase separation between a metal and an insulator.
The compressibility in the metallic phase is substantially enhanced. At quite
larger values of the coupling a polaronic phase emerges coexisting with a
non-polaronic metal.

composed of thousands of hardware and software components depending on each
other in a very complex manner. Typically, such systems are operated by
non-expert shift operators, which are not aware of system functionality
details. It is therefore necessary to help the operator to control the system
and to minimize system down-time by providing knowledge-based facilities for
automatic testing and verification of system components and also for error
diagnostics and recovery. For this purpose, a verification and diagnostic
framework was developed in the scope of ATLAS TDAQ. The verification
functionality of the framework allows developers to configure simple low-level
tests for any component in a TDAQ configuration. The test can be configured as
one or more processes running on different hosts. The framework organizes tests
in sequences, using knowledge about components hierarchy and dependencies, and
allowing the operator to verify the functionality of any subset of the system.
The diagnostics functionality includes the possibility to analyze the test
results and diagnose detected errors, e.g. by starting additional tests and
understanding reasons of failures. A conclusion about system functionality,
error diagnosis and recovery advice are presented to the operator in a GUI. The
current implementation uses the CLIPS expert system shell for knowledge
representation and reasoning.

use this to build coherent state representations and to derive a close analog

conformal partition function in non trivial geometries obtained by removal of
hulls from the upper half plane. This is then applied to stochastic Loewner
evolutions (SLE). We give a rigorous derivation of the equations, obtained
previously by the authors, that connect the stochastic Loewner equation to the
representation theory of the Virasoro algebra. We give a new proof that this
construction enumerates all polynomial SLE martingales. When one of the hulls

function is a famous local martingale known to probabilists, thereby
unravelling its CFT origin.

experimental data. The model provides a very good description of all measured
momentum distributions in central and semiperipheral Au+Au collisions,
including the momentum anisotropies (elliptic flow) and systematic dependencies
on the hadron rest masses up to transverse momenta of about 1.5--2 GeV/c. This
provides impressive evidence that the bulk of the fireball matter shows
efficient thermalization and behaves hydrodynamically. At higher p_t the
hydrodynamic model begins to gradually break down, following an interesting
pattern which we discuss. The elliptic flow anisotropy is shown to develop
early in the collision and to provide important information about the early
expansion stage, pointing to the formation of a highly equilibrated quark-gluon
plasma at energy densities well above the deconfinement threshold. Two-particle
momentum correlations provide information about the spatial structure of the
fireball (size, deformation, flow) at the end of the collision. Hydrodynamic
calculations of the two-particle correlation functions do not describe the data
very well. Possible origins of the discrepancies are discussed but not fully
resolved, and further measurements to help clarify this situation are
suggested.

substantial sensitivity in the low-lying spectra to the presence of the
realistic three-body force and an overall improvement in the level-ordering and
level-spacing in comparison to experiment. The greatest sensitivity occurs for
states where the spin-orbit interaction strength is known to play a role. In
particular, with the TNI we obtain the correct ground-state spin for 10,11,12B

It is found that at small energy scale, fluctuation of the strength function
almost obeys the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) random matrix theory limit.
On the other hand, we found a deviation from the GOE limit at the intermediate
energy scale about 1.7MeV for the IS and at 0.9MeV for the IV. The results
imply that different types of fluctuations coexist at different energy scales.
Detailed analysis strongly suggests that GOE fluctuation at small energy scale
is due to the complicated nature of 2p2h states and that fluctuation at the
intermediate energy scale is associated with the spreading width of the
Tamm-Dancoff 1p1h states.

been included in the orthodox view of the deBroglie Bohm theory, are unphysical
and have done much to undermine the original theory's appeal. We, therefore,
return to the original theory as our starting point and address one of its
perplexing areas: the quantum potential. By avoiding the unphysical conjectures
we are led to an understanding of the quantum potential which is distinctly
different from that of the orthodox deBroglie Bohm view.

  Pritchard","Dispersion Compensation for Atom Interferometry",,,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.060405",,"quant-ph",,"  A new technique for maintaining high contrast in an atom interferometer is
used to measure large de Broglie wave phase shifts. Dependence of an
interaction induced phase on the atoms' velocity is compensated by applying an
engineered \emph{counter phase}. The counter phase is equivalent to a rotation
and precisely determined by a frequency, and can be used to measure phase
shifts due to interactions of unknown strength. Phase shifts of 150 radians (5
times larger than previously possible) have now been measured in an atom beam
interferometer and we suggest that this technique can enable comparisons of
atomic polarizability with precision of one part in 10,000.

Homodyne detection, allows a tunable tradeoff between fidelity and probability.
By sacrificing probability of operation, an excellent approximation to a photon

A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.68.063803",,"quant-ph",,"  We study the multiorder coherent Raman scattering of a quantum probe field in
a far-off-resonance medium with a prepared coherence. Under the conditions of
negligible dispersion and limited bandwidth, we derive a Bessel-function
solution for the sideband field operators. We analytically and numerically
calculate various quantum statistical characteristics of the sideband fields.
We show that the multiorder coherent Raman process can replicate the
statistical properties of a single-mode quantum probe field into a broad comb
of generated Raman sidebands. We also study the mixing and modulation of photon
statistical properties in the case of two-mode input. We show that the prepared
Raman coherence and the medium length can be used as control parameters to
switch a sideband field from one type of photon statistics to another type, or
from a non-squeezed state to a squeezed state and vice versa.

particular pair of (opposite- subsystem) observables are shown to be
responsible both for the amount of quasi-classical correlations and for that of
the purely quantum entanglement in the pure-state case: the former via
simultaneous subsystem measurements, and the latter through the entropy of
coherence or of incompatibility, which is defined for the general case. The
observables at issue are so-called twin observables. A general definition of
the latter is given in terms of their detailed properties.

  particles","LaTeX, 13 pages with 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum theory of interference phenomena does not take the diameter of the
particle into account, since particles were much smaller than the width of the
slits in early observations. In recent experiments with large molecules, the
diameter of the particle has approached the width of the slits. Therefore,
analytical description of these cases should include a finite particle size.
The generic quantum interference setup is an asymmetric double slit
interferometer. We evaluate the wave function of the particle transverse motion
using two forms of the solution of Schrodinger's equation in an asymmetric
interferometer: the Fresnel-Kirchhoff form and the form derived from the
transverse wave function in the momentum representation. The transverse
momentum distribution is independent of the distance from the slits, while the
space distribution strongly depends on this distance. Based on the transverse
momentum distribution we determined the space distribution of particles behind
the slits. We will present two cases: a) when the diameter of the particle may
be neglected with respect to the width of both slits, and b) when the diameter
of the particle is larger than the width of the smaller slit.

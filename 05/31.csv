stellar pulsations sample the core and the envelope, which can potentially lead
to an ambiguity in the asteroseismologically derived locations of internal
structures. We provide an intuitive example of the source of this symmetry by
analogy with a vibrating string. For the stellar case, we focus on the white
dwarf stars, establishing the practical consequences for high-order white dwarf
pulsations both analytically and numerically. In addition, we verify the effect
empirically by cross-fitting two different structural models, and we discuss
the consequences that this approximate symmetry may have for past and present
asteroseismological fits of the pulsating DBV, GD 358. Finally, we show how the
signatures of composition transition zones that are brought about by physically
distinct processes may be used to help alleviate this potential ambiguity in
our asteroseismological interpretation of the pulsation frequencies observed in
white dwarf stars.

system is developed. The disk is treated as a set of gravitating rings, with
the rings'/planets' time-evolution governed by the classical Laplace-Lagrange
solution for secular evolution but modified to account for the disk's finite
thickness h. This system's Lagrange planetary equations yield a particular
class of spiral wave solutions, usually denoted as apsidal density waves and
nodal bending waves. There are two varieties of apsidal waves:long waves and
short waves. Planets typically launch long density waves at the disk's nearer
edge or else at a secular resonance in the disk, and these waves ultimately
reflect downstream at a more distant disk edge or else at a Q-barrier in the
disk, whereupon they return as short density waves. Planets also launch nodal
bending waves, and these have the property that they can stall in the disk,
that is, their group velocity plummets to zero upon approaching a disk region
too thick to support the continued propagation of bending waves. The rings
model is used to compute the secular evolution of a Kuiper Belt having a
variety of masses, and it is shown that the early massive Belt was very
susceptible to the propagation of low-amplitude apsidal and nodal waves
launched by the giant planets.

observational cosmology. Utilizing our photometric redshift technique a volume
limited sample containing more than 2 million galaxies is constructed from the
SDSS galaxy catalog. In the largest such analysis to date, we study the angular
clustering as a function of luminosity and spectral type. Using Limber's
equation we calculate the clustering length for the full data set as
r0=5.77+/-0.10 Mpc/h. We find that r0 increases with luminosity by a factor of
1.6 over the sampled luminosity range, in agreement with previous redshift
surveys. We also find that both the clustering length and the slope of the
correlation function depend on the galaxy type. In particular, by splitting the
galaxies in four groups by their rest-frame type we find a bimodal behavior in
their clustering properties. Galaxies with spectral types similar to elliptical
galaxies have a correlation length of 6.59 +/- 0.17 Mpc/h and a slope of the
angular correlation function of 0.96 +/- 0.05 while blue galaxies have a
clustering length of 4.51 +/- 0.19 Mpc/h and a slope of 0.68 +/- 0.09. The two
intermediate color groups behave like their more extreme 'siblings', rather
than showing a gradual transition in slope. We discuss these correlations in

strengths in the plane of the sky, $B_{pos}$. The analysis used the
Chandrasekhar-Fermi technique, which relates the dispersion in polarization
position angles to $B_{pos}$. We have used these estimates of the field
strengths (neglecting the unmeasured line-of-sight component) to find the
mass-to-magnetic flux ratios $\lambda$ (in units of the critical ratio for
magnetic support). Results are $B_{pos} \approx 80$ $\mu$G and $\lambda \approx
2.6$ for L183, $B_{pos} \approx 140$ $\mu$G and $\lambda \approx 2.3$ for
L1544, and $B_{pos} \approx 160$ $\mu$G and $\lambda \approx 1.9$ for L43.
Hence, without correction for geometrical biases, for all three cores the
mass-to-flux ratios are supercritical by a factor of $\sim 2$, and magnetic
support cannot prevent collapse. However, a statistical mean correction for
geometrical bias may be up to a factor of three; this correction would reduce
the individual $\lambda$'s to $\lambda_{cor} \approx 0.9$, 0.8, and 0.6,
respectively; these values are approximately critical or slightly subcritical.
These data are consistent with models of star formation driven by ambipolar
diffusion in a weakly turbulent medium, but cannot rule out models of star
formation driven by turbulence.

neutrino-antineutrino interactions on a general background. The dispersion
relation admits a novel modulational instability. The results are examined,
together with a numerical example, and we discuss the induced density
inhomogeneities using parameters relevant to the early Universe.

  2003. In CD-ROM: ISBN 84-9750-180-2",,,"cond-mat.supr-con",,"  In type-II superconductors, in the regime of very high applied current
density, an abrupt transition is experimentally observed from the mixed state
to a highly dissipative regime, probably the normal state. This provokes a high
voltage jump in the Current-Voltage Characteristics (CVC) of the samples, at a
current density J* larger than the critical current Jc. In this work we study
Y-123 (YBCO) microbridges sputtered over SrTiO3 substrates. We measure their
CVCs for different temperatures close to Tc, and with low applied magnetic
field, from 0 to 1 T. We compare the dependences of Jc and J*, and find that
some of the typical experimental results in this regime could be explained by
only considering the effect of the current self-field. This suggests that the
depairing of the supercarriers could be involved in the abrupt transition. We
also study the influence of thermal effects, by using a simplified model to
describe the thermal evolution of our samples. We find that the uniform
self-heating can produce an abrupt thermal runaway, at high current density,
which could explain the occurrence of J*, as well as its dependence on
temperature and applied magnetic field. These results do not totally exclude
the implication of other more intrinsic mechanisms (like Cooper pairs
depairing, or a change in the regime of the vortex dynamics), but suggest that
the uniform self-heating is more relevant than what was considered up to now.
In a shorter second part of the thesis, the contribution of the author to the
study of the paraconductivity in his laboratory is reflected.

using acoustic scattering by soap bubbles inflated with helium. Gathering a

VO's was a largely manual operation. With the advance of large collaboration,
linking more than 10000 users with a 1000 sites in 150 counties, a
comprehensive, automated management system is required. It should be simple
enough not to deter users, while at the same time ensuring local site autonomy.

Besides that, quite often is useful to tag collections of Conditions Data

model has been proposed and used for different implementations based in
commercial DBMSs, both at CERN and for the BaBar experiment. The special case
of the ATLAS complex trigger that requires online access to calibration and
alignment data poses new challenges that have to be met using a flexible and
customizable solution more in the line of Open Source components. Motivated by
the ATLAS challenges we have developed an alternative implementation, based in
an Open Source RDBMS. Several issues were investigated land will be described
in this paper:
  -The best way to map the conditions data model into the relational database
concept considering what are foreseen as the most frequent queries.
  -The clustering model best suited to address the scalability problem.
-Extensive tests were performed and will be described.
  The very promising results from these tests are attracting the attention from
the HEP community and driving further developments.

B_0}-{\bb E}_{\cl B}\|_{\infty,2}$. Under the hypothesis that the relative
commutant in $\cl N$ of each algebra is equal to its center, we prove that
close subalgebras have large compressions which are spatially isomorphic by a
partial isometry close to 1 in the $\|\cdot \|_2$--norm. This hypothesis is
satisfied, in particular, by masas and subfactors of trivial relative
commutant. A general version with a slightly weaker conclusion is also proved.
As a consequence, we show that if $\cl A$ is a masa and $u\in\cl N$ is a
unitary such that $\cl A$ and $u\cl Au^*$ are close, then $u$ must be close to
a unitary which normalizes $\cl A$. These qualitative statements are given
quantitative formulations in the paper.

fiber-optical setup and a pair of standard avalanche photodiodes. The detector
is capable of resolving individual photon numbers, and operates on the
well-known principle by which a single mode input state is split into a large
number (eight) of output modes. We reconstruct the photon statistics of weak
coherent input light from experimental data, and show that there is a high
probability of inferring the input photon number from a measurement of the
number of detection events on a single run.

schemes, distinguishing information between the photons is eliminated
guaranteeing high visibility interference. We propose practical techniques
which lead to suitably engineered two-photon states that can be realistically
implemented with available technology. Finally, we study an implementation of
the nonlinear-sign shift (NS) logic gate with PDC sources and show the effect
of distinguishing information on the performance of the gate.

practice this is impossible because the environment $U\setminusS$ of the system

infinitely many degrees of freedom. A novel method of construction density

proposed. The Hilbert space of state vectors for the hierarchic quantum systems

Hamiltonian systems, characterized by the time dependence of the linear entropy
of the reduced density operator, is introduced. The similarities and
differences between the classical and quantum decoherence dynamics of an
initial quantum state are exposed using both analytical and computational
results. In particular, the classicality of early-time intrinsic decoherence
dynamics is explored analytically using a second-order perturbative treatment,
and an interesting connection between decoherence rates and the stability
nature of classical trajectories is revealed in a simple approximate classical
theory of intrinsic decoherence dynamics. The results offer new insights into
decoherence, dynamics of quantum entanglement, and quantum chaos.

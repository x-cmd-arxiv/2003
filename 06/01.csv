Tauri stars and argue that their observational properties are identical to
those of Class I sources. They may therefore be embedded protostars in a much
earlier evolutionary phase than T Tauri stars, in which case these multiple
systems are significantly non-coeval as opposed to the majority of young binary
systems. They would have formed through a different mechanism than core
fragmentation. The only distinction between IRCs and Class I sources is that
they lie within a few tens of AU of a T Tauri star, and so they cannot be at
the center of a vast optically thick envelope as is believed to be the case for
protostars. We discuss whether systems with an IRC are really candidates for
non-coeval multiple systems.

method allows incorporating background anisotropies by vetoing existing small
scale regions on the sky and compensating for known large scale anisotropies.
By giving an example using Milagro gamma ray observatory we demonstrate how the
method can be employed to relax the detector stability assumption. Two
practical implementations of the method are discussed. The method is universal
and can be used with any large field-of-view detector, where the object of

acceleration process should vary strongly over the surface of supernova remnant
shocks. These variations and the absolute value of the injection rate are
investigated. In the simplest case, like for SN 1006, the shock can be
approximated as being spherical in a uniform large-scale magnetic field. The
injection rate depends strongly on the shock obliquity and diminishes as the
angle between the ambient field and the shock normal increases. Therefore
efficient particle injection, which leads to conversion of a significant
fraction of the kinetic energy at a shock surface element, arises only in
relatively small regions near the ""poles"", reducing the overall CR production.
The sizes of these regions depend strongly on the random background field and
the Alfven wave turbulence generated due to CR streaming instability. For the
cases of SN 1006 and Tycho's SNR they correspond to about 20, and for Cas A to
between 10 and 20 percent of the entire shock surface. In first approximation,
the CR production rate, calculated under the assumption of spherical symmetry,
has therefore to be renormalized by this factor, while the shock as such
remains roughly spherical.

  In this Letter we discuss the dependence of PBH formation on effective
relativistic degrees of freedom, $g_{\rm eff}$ during the cosmic QCD phase
transition.
  Our finding is important in the light of recent cosmological arguments of
several new classes of cosmic energy that appear from universal neutrino
degeneracy, quintessential inflation, and dark radiation in brane world
cosmology. Extra-energy component from the standard value in these new
cosmological theories is represented as an effective radiation in terms of
$g_{\rm eff}$. We conclude that the PBH formation during QCD phase transition
becomes more efficient if negative extra-component of the cosmic energy is
allowed because of the increase of the duration of the QCD phase transition,
which leads to smaller mass scale of PBHs. This suggests larger probability of
finding more PBHs if the dark radiation exists as allowed in the brane world
cosmology.

the observed evolution of the cluster abundance quite well. The strong
dependence of the cluster abundance on the decay rate of dark matter suggests
that distant cluster surveys may offer clues to the nature of dark matter.

a measure of structural comparison of lattice structures that is analgous to

use this measure of structural relatedness to create a graph of lattice
structures and compare this graph (in which nodes are lattice structures and
edges are defined using structural similarity) to the graph obtained for real
protein structures. We find that the graph obtained from all compact lattice
structures exhibits a distribution of structural neighbors per node consistent
with a random graph. We also find that subgraphs of 3500 nodes chosen either at

develop a divergent evolution model based on the lattice space which produces

occupied by at least one B particle. The B particle species undergoes
diffusion-limited reactions. In an active state with nonzero, essentially
homogeneous B particle saturation density, the A species displays normal
diffusion. In an inactive, absorbing phase with exponentially decaying B
density, the A particles become localized. In situations with algebraic decay
rho_B(t) ~ t^{-alpha_B}, as occuring either at a non-equilibrium continuous
phase transition separating active and absorbing states, or in a power-law
inactive phase, the A particles propagate subdiffusively with mean-square

our simulation data, \alpha_A = \alpha_B as predicted by a simple mean-field
approach. This remains true even in the presence of strong spatio-temporal
fluctuations of the B density. However, in contrast with the mean-field
results, our data yield a distinctly non-Gaussian A particle displacement
distribution n_A(x,t) that obeys dynamic scaling and looks remarkably similar

emittance compensation. A key question is whether beams can support chaotic
orbits, and if so, under what conditions? We numerically investigate the
parameter space of three-dimensional thermal-equilibrium beams with space

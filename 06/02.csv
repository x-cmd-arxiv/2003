on the angular diameter distance, which makes large scale structure

radiative transfer calculations. Mainly motivated by its simple computational
application it is probably in many cases an oversimplified treatment of the
dynamical processes involved. This aspect is in particular important in the
analysis of maser lines, since the strong amplification of radiation leads to a
sensitive dependence of the radiation field on the overall velocity structure.
To demonstrate the influence of large scale motions on the formation of maser
lines we present a simple stochastic model which takes velocity correlations
into account. For a quantitative analysis of correlation effects, we generate
in a Monte Carlo simulation individual realizations of a turbulent velocity
field along a line of sight. Depending on the size of the velocity correlation
length we find huge deviations between the resulting random profiles in respect
of line shape, intensity and position of single spectral components. Finally,
we simulate the emission of extended maser sources. A qualitative comparison
with observed masers associated with star forming regions shows that our model
can reproduce the observed general spectral characteristics. We also
investigate shortly, how the spectra are effected when a systematic velocity
field (simulating expansion) is superposed on the fluctuations. Our results
convincingly demonstrate that hydrodynamical motions are of great importance
for the understanding of cosmic masers.

In this Comments, we would like to point out that this 'enhancement' comes from
a misunderstanding to the boosting persistent current in the Luttinger liquid
theory. A correct calculation will not give such an enhancement of the
persistent spin current. Meanwhile, we provide a Luttinger liquid theory with
Rashba spin-orbital interaction by bosonization, which may show how the Rashba

the recent characterization of the loading process of the genome inside the

double-stranded DNA as a flexible thick polymer (tube) instead of a

results to genome lengths appropriate for $\phi$29, we find that the
thickness-induced force may account for up to half the one measured
experimentally at high packing densities. An analogous agreement is found for
the total work that has to be spent in the packaging process. Remarkably, such
agreement can be obtained in the absence of any tunable parameters and is a
mere consequence of the DNA thickness. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative

The expression accounts for the significant difference in the persistence
lengths of single- and double-stranded DNA (again with the sole input of their

the simulation cell and introduces the excluded volume rapidly, leads to
deformation on short length scales. This deformation is strongest for long
chains and relaxes only after the chains have moved their own size. Two methods
are shown to overcome this local deformation of the chains. One method is to
first pre-pack the Gaussian chains, which reduces the density fluctuations in
the system, followed by a gradual introduction of the excluded volume. The
second method is a double-pivot algorithm in which new bonds are formed across
a pair of chains, creating two new chains each substantially different from the
original. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods for a linear bead
spring polymer model with both zero and nonzero bending stiffness, however the
methods are applicable to more complex architectures such as branched and star

from the walls, is almost constant throughout the slit capillary and gives rise
to an adsorption that is constant along the critical isochore. The same
'neutral' wall yields a line of capillary coexistence that is almost identical
to the bulk coexistence line. In the crossover regime we observe features in
the density profile similar to those found in the magnetisation profile of the
critical Ising film subject to weak surface fields, namely two smooth maxima,
located away from the walls, which merge into a single maximum at midpoint as
the strength of the wall-fluid interaction is reduced or as the distance

slicing-dependent) radial coordinate. This can be used to determine gauge modes
and to compare time evolutions with different gauge conditions. CE surfaces
also provide an efficient way to find new apparent horizons as they appear e.g.
in binary black hole simulations.

The measurements of the heavy quark asymmetries are used to extract the

of Wilson fermions, proposing the following microscopic picture. The
super-critical regions inside and outside the Aoki phase are characterized by
the existence of a density of near-zero modes of the (hermitian) Wilson-Dirac
operator, and thus by a non-vanishing pion condensate. Inside the Aoki phase,
this density is built up from extended near-zero modes, while outside the Aoki
phase, there is a non-vanishing density of exponentially localized near-zero
modes, which occur in ""exceptional"" gauge-field configurations. Nevertheless,
no Goldstone excitations appear outside the Aoki phase, and the existence of
Goldstone excitations may therefore be used to define the Aoki phase in both
the quenched and unquenched theories. We show that the density of localized
near-zero modes gives rise to a divergent pion two-point function, thus
providing an alternative mechanism for satisfying the relevant Ward identity in
the presence of a non-zero order parameter. This divergence occurs when we take
a ""twisted"" quark mass to zero, and we conclude that quenched QCD with Wilson
fermions is well-defined only with a non-vanishing twisted mass. We show that
this peculiar behavior of the near-zero-mode density is special to the quenched
theory by demonstrating that this density vanishes in the unquenched theory
outside the Aoki phase. We discuss the implications for domain-wall and overlap
fermions constructed from a Wilson-Dirac kernel. We argue that both methods
work outside the Aoki phase, but fail inside because of problems with locality
and/or chiral symmetry, in both the quenched and unquenched theories.

of the indicated experiment to $\Delta m^2_{\rm atm}$, which drives the
dominant atmospheric $\nu_{\mu}$ ($\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$) oscillations, and to
$\theta$ - the neutrino mixing angle limited by the data from the CHOOZ and
Palo Verde experiments. We find that this experiment can improve the bounds on
$\sin^2\theta$. If the value of $\sin^2\theta$ is large enough, $\sin^2\theta
\gtap 0.02$, the energy resolution of the detector is sufficiently good and if
the statistics is relatively high, it can determine with extremely high

standard model with hidden variables. In particular, this is not a reduction of
quantum model to the classical one. Moreover, we see that such a reduction is
even in principle impossible. This impossibility is not a consequence of a
mathematical theorem but it follows from the physical structure of the model.

fundamental parameters - PRESPACE. Those domains represent complexes of
physical conditions. By our model both classical and quantum physics describe

  We here derive path integrals directly by imposing two requirements: correct
behavior in the classical limit and the most complete practicable symmetry
between time and space.
  With these requirements, the path integral formalism predicts quantum
fluctuations over the time dimension analogous to the quantum fluctuations seen
over the three space dimensions. For constant potentials there is no effect.
But the coupling between rapidly varying electromagnetic fields and the quantum
fluctuations in time should be detectable.
  We consider a variation on the Stern-Gerlach experiment in which a particle
with a non-zero electric dipole moment is sent through a rapidly varying
electric field, oriented parallel to the particle's trajectory. The
Schroedinger equation predicts changes to the precession frequency of the wave
function about the trajectory but no physical splitting of the beam. With the
approach here, path integrals predict the changes to the precession frequency
and in addition that the beam will be split in velocity and time.

involves two elements. The first one is self-induced decoherence, conceived as
a process that depends on the own dynamics of a closed quantum system governed
by a Hamiltonian with continuous spectrum; the study of decoherence is
addressed by means of a formalism used to give meaning to the van Hove states
with diagonal singularities. The second element is macroscopicity: when the
macroscopic limit is applied to the Wigner transformation of the diagonal state
resulting from decoherence, the description of the quantum system becomes
equivalent to the description of an ensemble of classical trajectories on phase
space weighted by their corresponding probabilities.

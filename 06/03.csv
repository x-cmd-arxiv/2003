  Observatories Astrophysics Series, Vol. 2), ed. W.L. Freedman",,,,"astro-ph",,"  There are now 10 firm time delay measurements in gravitational lenses. The
physics of time delays is well understood, and the only important variable for
interpreting the time delays to determine H_0 is the mean surface mass density
<k> (in units of the critical density for gravitational lensing) of the lens
galaxy at the radius of the lensed images. More centrally concentrated mass
distributions with lower <k> predict higher Hubble constants, with H_0~1-<k> to
lowest order. While we cannot determine <k> directly given the available data
on the current time delay lenses, we find H_0=48+/-3 km/s/Mpc for the
isothermal (flat rotation curve) models, which are our best present estimate
for the mass distributions of the lens galaxies. Only if we eliminate the dark
matter halo of the lenses and use a constant mass-to-light ratio (M/L) model to
find H_0=71+/-3 km/s/Mpc is the result consistent with local estimates.
Measurements of time delays in better-constrained systems or observations to
obtain new constraints on the current systems provide a clear path to
eliminating the <k> degeneracy and making estimates of H_0 with smaller
uncertainties than are possible locally. Independent of the value of H_0, the
time delay lenses provide a new and unique probe of the dark matter
distributions of galaxies and clusters because they measure the total (light +
dark) matter surface density.

emphasized lack of massive planets (m_2sini>=2M_Jup) on short-period orbits

feature is shown not to be due to small-number statistics with Monte-Carlo
simulations. These observational period-related characteristics are discussed

agreement with recent simulations of planet interactions with viscous disks.
The observed valley at a few tens of days in the period distribution is
interpreted as a transition region between two categories of planets that
suffered different migration scenarios. The lack of light planets on
longer-period orbits and the corresponding intriguing sharp limit in mass is
tentatively explained by the runaway migration process recently studied by
Masset & Papaloizou (2003). The observed properties also have implications for
the observation strategies of the on-going surveys and of future

plus two fainter extended regions possibly associated with the Tornado's

3-sigma luminosity (0.5-10 keV) of 1e33 ergs/s, for a distance to the system of
12 kpc. The spectrum of the brightest region of X-rays is consistent with a
heavily absorbed (N_H ~ 1e23 cm^-2) thermal plasma of temperature kT ~ 0.6 keV;
an absorbed power law can also fit the data, but implies an extremely steep
photon index. From these data we tentatively conclude that the Tornado is a
supernova remnant (SNR), although we are unable to rule out the possibility
that the Tornado is powered either by outflows from an X-ray binary or by the
relativistic wind of an unseen pulsar. Within the SNR interpretation, the head
of the Tornado is a limb-brightened radio shell containing centrally-filled
thermal X-rays and which is interacting with a molecular cloud. We therefore
propose that the Tornado is a ""mixed morphology"" supernova remnant. The unusual
tail component of the Tornado remains unexplained in this interpretation, but
might result from expansion of the SNR into an elongated progenitor wind
bubble.

simultaneous, purely geometric, measures of the Hubble parameter H(z) and
angular diameter distance D_A(z) via an absolute version of the

future surveys can exploit these rings of power for dark energy studies. High-z
CMB determinations of H and D_A are best complemented at moderate to low
redshift (z < 0.5) with a population of objects that are at least as abundant

level for D_A(z) and H(z) in several redshift bins. This, in turn, implies
errors of sigma(w)=0.03-0.05 for a constant dark energy equation of state in a
flat universe. Deep galaxy cluster surveys such as the planned South Pole
Telescope (SPT) survey, can extend this test out to z~1 or as far as redshift

``quiescent'', and more than half are identified as ``coherent''. The fact that
dynamically evolving cores in highly supersonic turbulent flows can be
quiescent may be understood because cores lie at the stagnation points of
convergent turbulent flows, where compression is at a maximum, and relative
velocity differences are at a minimum. The coherence may be due to an
observational effect related to the length and concentration of the material
contributing to the line. The velocity dispersion of the our cores often has
its local maximum at small offsets from the column density maximum, suggesting
that the core is the dense region behind a shock. Such a configuration is often
found in observations of molecular cloud cores, and argues in favor of the
gravoturbulent scenario of stellar birth as it is not expected in
star-formation models based on magnetic mediation. Cores with collapsed objects
tend to be near equipartition between their gravitational and kinetic energies,
while cores without collapsed objects tend to be gravitationally unbound,
suggesting that gravitational collapse occurs immediately after gravity becomes
dominant. Finally, cores in simulations driven at large scales are more
frequently quiescent and coherent, and have more realistic ratios of $M_{\rm

that mass transfer from 2.8 - 3.3 Msun helium stars and from 3.3 - 3.8 Msun in
very close orbits (P_orb > 0.25d) will end up in a common-envelope (CE) and
spiral-in phase due to the development of a convective helium envelope. If the
neutron star has sufficient time to complete the spiraling-in process before
the core collapses, the system will produce very tight DNSs (P_orb ~ 0.01d)
with a merger timescale of the order of 1 Myr or less. These systems would have
important consequences for the detection rate of GWR and for the understanding
of GRB progenitors. On the other hand, if the time left until the explosion is
shorter than the orbital-decay timescale, the system will undergo a SN
explosion during the CE phase. Helium stars with masses 3.3 - 3.8 Msun in wider
orbits (P_orb > 0.25d) and those more massive than 3.8 Msun do not go through
CE evolution. The remnants of these massive helium stars are DNSs with periods
in the range of 0.1 - 1 d. This suggests that this range of mass includes the
progenitors of the galactic DNSs with close orbits (B1913+16 and B1534+12). A
minimum kick velocity of 70 km/s and 0 km/s (for B1913+16 and B1534+12,

The DNSs with wider orbits (J1518+4904 and probably J1811-1736) are produced
from helium star-neutron star binaries which avoid RLOF, with the helium star
more massive than 2.5 Msun. For these systems the minimum kick velocities are

These results suggest that massive galaxies (e.g., galactic nuclei) experience
substantial star formation before the central quasar becomes observable. The
extent and epoch of this star formation (nominally at redshifts z > 2, but
sometimes at z > 5) are consistent with observations of old metal-rich stars in
present-day galactic nuclei/spheroids, and with standard models of galactic
chemical evolution. There is further tantalizing (but very tentative) evidence,
based on FeII/MgII broad emission line ratios, that the star formation usually

reveal properties that are consistent with two, very different, interpretations
of the pulsar's viewing geometry. The pulsar's average polarization properties
show a rapid change in position angle (PA) near the pulse center, suggesting
that the observer's sightline nearly intersects the star's magnetic pole. But
single pulse, polarization observations of the pulsar show nearly orthogonal
modes of polarization following relatively flat and parallel PA trajectories
across the pulse, suggesting that the sightline is far from the pole.
Additionally, PA histograms reveal a ""modal connecting bridge"", of unknown
origin, joining the modal PA trajectories over much of the pulse and following
the rapid PA change shown in the average data. The nonorthogonality of
polarization modes is incorporated in a statistical model of radio polarization
to account for the deviations from mode orthogonality that are observed in the
pulsar. The model is used to interpret the rapid PA change and modal connecting
bridge as a longitudinally-resolved transition between modes of nonorthogonal
polarization. Thus, the modal PA trajectories are argued to reflect the
pulsar's true viewing geometry. This interpretation is consistent with the
pulsar's morphological classification, preserves the Radhakrishnan & Cooke
model of pulsar radio emission, and avoids the complication that the modal
connecting bridge might be produced by some other emission mechanism. The
statistical model's ability to simulate the rich variety of polarization
properties observed in the emission lends additional support to the model's
applicability and its underlying assumption that the polarization modes occur
simultaneously.

powder pattern in the NMR spectrum, the ab-plane Knight shift in the normal
state was estimated by the magnetic field dependence of second-order quadrupole
shifts at various temperatures. Below 50 K, the Knight shift shows a
Curie-Weiss-like temperature dependence, similarly to the bulk magnetic
susceptibility chi. From the analysis of so-called K-chi plot, the spin and the
orbital components of K and the positive hyperfine coupling constant were
estimated. The onset temperature of superconducting transition in the Knight
shift does not change so much in an applied magnetic field up to 7 T, which is
consistent with the reported high upper critical field Hc2. The Knight shift at
7 T shows an invariant behavior below Tc. No coherence peak just below Tc was
observed in the temperature dependence of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation
rate 1/T1 in both cases of NMR and NQR. We conclude that the invariant behavior
of the Knight shift below Tc and unconventional behaviors of 1/T possibly
indicate the spin-triplet superconductivity with p- or f-wave symmetry.

with the paramagnetic depairing, the temperature at which the mean field (MF)

$H_{\rm FFLO}(T)$ between an FFLO-like and the ordinary vortex solids branch,

evolve due to the influence of agents in a local neighborhood. In a single
update step, a fixed-size group is defined and all agents in the group adopt
the state of the local majority with probability p or that of the local
minority with probability 1-p. For group size G=3, there is a phase transition
at p_c=2/3 in all spatial dimensions. For p>p_c, the global majority quickly
predominates, while for p<p_c, the system is driven to a mixed state in which
the densities of agents in each state are equal. For p=p_c, the average
magnetization (the difference in the density of agents in the two states) is
conserved and the system obeys classical voter model dynamics. In one dimension
and within a Kirkwood decoupling scheme, the final magnetization in a
finite-length system has a non-trivial dependence on the initial magnetization
for all p.ne.p_c, in agreement with numerical results. At p_c, the exact 2-spin
correlation functions decay algebraically toward the value 1 and the system
coarsens as in the classical voter model.

increase with travelling path as more and more random scattering incurs,
followed by a saturation, then start to decay exponentially when the travelling

  In the paper the in-plane and out-of-plane impurities present in layered

superconducting transition temperature T_c. The relative change of isotope
shift coefficient, however, is an universal function of T_c/T_{c0} (T_{c0}

rate and density of states function it does not depend whether the change of
T_c is due to in- or out-of-plane impurities. The role of the anisotropic
impurity scattering in changing oxygen isotope coefficient of superconductors
with various symmetries of the order parameter is elucidated. The comparison of
the calculated and experimental dependence of \alpha/\alpha_0, where \alpha_0

programs with negation-as-failure allowed in clause bodies. In our semantics
the meaning of a program is, as in the classical case, the unique minimum model
in a program-independent ordering. We use an expanded truth domain that has an
uncountable linearly ordered set of truth values between False (the minimum
element) and True (the maximum), with a Zero element in the middle. The truth
values below Zero are ordered like the countable ordinals. The values above
Zero have exactly the reverse order. Negation is interpreted as reflection
about Zero followed by a step towards Zero; the only truth value that remains
unaffected by negation is Zero. We show that every program has a unique minimum
model M_P, and that this model can be constructed with a T_P iteration which
proceeds through the countable ordinals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that M_P
can also be obtained through a model intersection construction which
generalizes the well-known model intersection theorem for classical logic
programming. Finally, we show that by collapsing the true and false values of
the infinite-valued model M_P to (the classical) True and False, we obtain a
three-valued model identical to the well-founded one.

of the unique Hilbert space structure on H to construct the observables of the

Hamiltonian each leading to a different notion of time-evolution in H. Among
these is a particular choice that generates t-translations in H and identifies
t with time whenever D is t-independent. For a t-dependent D, we show that
t-translations never correspond to unitary evolutions in H, and t cannot be
identified with time. We apply these ideas to develop a formulation of quantum
cosmology based on the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a Friedman-Robertson-Walker

gravitational waves is encouraging. Building on previous work, I am arguing
that the strong variable electromagnetic fields are appropriate systems for the
generation and detection of high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGW). The
advantages of electromagnetic systems are clearly seen in the proposed complete
laboratory experiment, where one has to ensure the efficiency of, both, the
process of generation and the process of detection of HFGW. Within the family
of electromagnetic systems, one still has a great variety of possible
geometrical configurations, classical and quantum states of the electromagnetic
field, detection strategies, etc. According to evaluations performed 30 years
ago, the gap between the HFGW laboratory signal and its level of detectability
is at least 4 orders of magnitude. Hopefully, new technologies of today can
remove this gap and can make the laboratory experiment feasible. The laboratory
experiment is bound to be expensive, but one should remember that a part of the
cost is likely to be reimbursed from the Nobel prize money ! Electromagnetic
systems seem also appropriate for the detection of high-frequency end of the
spectrum of relic gravitational waves. Although the current effort to observe
the stochastic background of relic gravitational waves is focused on the
opposite, very low-frequency, end of the spectrum, it would be extremely
valuable for fundamental science to detect, or put sensible upper limits on,
the high-frequency relic gravitational waves. I will briefly discuss the origin
of relic gravitational waves, the expected level of their high-frequency
signal, and the existing estimates of its detectability.

generate nonperturbative gravitational objects. Since cosmic rays have been
observed with energies above $10^{8}$ TeV, gravitational effects in the TeV
energy range can, in principle, be observed by ultrahigh energy cosmic ray
detectors. We consider the interaction of ultrahigh energy neutrinos in the
atmosphere and compare extensive air showers from TeV black hole formation and
fragmentation with standard model processes. Departures from the standard model
predictions arise in the interaction cross sections and in the multiplicity of
secondary particles. Large theoretical uncertainties in the black hole cross
section weaken attempts to constrain TeV gravity based solely on differences
between predicted and observed event rates. The large multiplicity of
secondaries in black hole fragmentation enhances the detectability of TeV
gravity effects. We simulate TeV black hole air showers using PYTHIA and AIRES,
and find that black hole-induced air showers are quite distinct from standard
model air showers. However, the limited amount of information registered by
realistic detectors together with large air shower fluctuations limit in
practice the ability to distinguish TeV gravity events from standard model
events in a shower by shower case. We discuss possible strategies to optimize
the detectability of black hole events and propose a few unique signatures that
may allow future high statistics detectors to separate black hole from standard

noncommutative-spacetime symmetries that relies on the introduction of a Weyl
map (connecting a given function in the noncommutative Minkowski with a
corresponding function in commutative Minkowski) and of a compatible notion of
integration in the noncommutative spacetime. We confirm (and we establish more
robustly) previous suggestions that the commutative-spacetime notion of
Lie-algebra symmetries must be replaced, in the noncommutative-spacetime
context, by the one of Hopf-algebra symmetries. We prove that in kappaMinkowski
it is possible to construct an action which is invariant under a Poincare-like
Hopf algebra of symmetries with 10 generators, in which the noncommutativity
length scale has the role of relativistic invariant. The approach here adopted
does leave one residual ambiguity, which pertains to the description of the
translation generators, but our results, independently of this ambiguity, are
sufficient to clarify that some recent studies (gr-qc/0212128 and

Constable and Myers, which involves a non-constant dilaton and S^5 radius. Both
these backgrounds exhibit confinement of fundamental matter and a discrete

We speculate on the existence of a third order phase transition at a critical
quark mass where the D7 embedding undergoes a geometric transition. In the

well as the associated Goldstone boson in the limit of small quark mass. The
existence of the condensate ensures that the D7-brane never reaches the naked

  Sorkin","Random MAX SAT, Random MAX CUT, and Their Phase Transitions","49 pages",,,,"math.CO math.PR",,"  Given a 2-SAT formula $F$ consisting of $n$ variables and $\cn$ random
clauses, what is the largest number of clauses $\max F$ satisfiable by a single
assignment of the variables? We bound the answer away from the trivial bounds
of $(3/4)cn$ and $cn$. We prove that for $c<1$, the expected number of clauses
satisfiable is $\cn-\Theta(1/n)$; for large $c$, it is $((3/4)c +
\Theta(\sqrt{c}))n$; for $c = 1+\eps$, it is at least $(1+\eps-O(\eps^3))n$ and
at most $(1+\eps-\Omega(\eps^3/\ln \eps))n$; and in the ``scaling window'' $c=
1+\Theta(n^{-1/3})$, it is $cn-\Theta(1)$. In particular, just as the decision
problem undergoes a phase transition, our optimization problem also undergoes a
phase transition at the same critical value $c=1$.
  Nearly all of our results are established without reference to the analogous
propositions for decision 2-SAT, and as a byproduct we reproduce many of those
results, including much of what is known about the 2-SAT scaling window.
  We consider ``online'' versions of MAX-2-SAT, and show that for one version,
the obvious greedy algorithm is optimal.
  We can extend only our simplest MAX-2-SAT results to MAX-k-SAT, but we
conjecture a ``MAX-k-SAT limiting function conjecture'' analogous to the
folklore satisfiability threshold conjecture, but open even for $k=2$. Neither
conjecture immediately implies the other, but it is natural to further
conjecture a connection between them.
  Finally, for random MAXCUT (the size of a maximum cut in a sparse random
graph) we prove analogous results.

calculations for IMFs production cross sections are rather satisfactory and the

importance in studies of electron beam-dumps and intense electron beam
accelerators. I also is mandatory to describe neutron backgrounds and
activation in linear colliders. This physics was elaborated in Geant4 over the
last year, and now entered into the stage of practical application.
  In the {\sc Geant4} Photo-nuclear data base there are at present about 50
nuclei for which the Photo-nuclear absorption cross sections have been
measured. Of these, data on 14 nuclei are used to parametrize the gamma nuclear
reaction cross-section The resulting cross section is a complex, factorized
function of $A$ and $e = log(E_\gamma)$, where $E_\gamma$ is the energy of the
incident photon.
  Electro-nuclear reactions are so closely connected with Photo-nuclear
reactions that sometimes they are often called ``Photo-nuclear''. The
one-photon exchange mechanism dominates in Electro-nuclear reactions, and the
electron can be substituted by a flux of photons. Folding this flux with the
gamma-nuclear cross-section, we arrive at an acceptable description of the
electro-nuclear physics.
  Final states in gamma and electro nuclear physics are described using chiral
invariant phase-space decay at low gamma or equivalent photon energies, and
quark gluon string model at high energies.
  We will present the modeling of this physics in {\sc Geant4}, and show
results from practical applications.

be organized in steps, which can be controlled from the GUI according to the
user specifications. Each step is composed of event objects, the event
processing, and event IO. Go4 composite event classes allow the construction of
arbitrary complex events hierarchically composed of objects. The IO of the
composite event objects to and from ROOT trees/branches is provided without
explicit programming. The Go4 tree viewer can browse arbitrary hierarchy levels
of composite events. The GUI provides hooks to attach user written GUIs. These
GUIs have access to all objects of the analysis, i.e. events for asynchronous

efficient. The Go4 fit package (API and GUI) is a powerful and extendable tool

discuss a thought experiment in which a Brownian particle is subjected to a

pattern, they derive a decoherence rate that is much faster than previous
results and even persists in the limit of vanishing dissipation. This result is
based on the definition of a certain attenuation factor, which they analyze for
short times. In this note, we point out that this attenuation factor captures
the physics of decoherence only for times larger than a certain time t_mix,
which is the time it takes until the two emerging wave packets begin to
overlap. Therefore, the strategy of Ford et al of extracting the decoherence
time from the regime t < t_mix is in our opinion not meaningful. If one
analyzes the attenuation factor for t > t_mix, one recovers familiar behaviour
for the decoherence time; in particular, no decoherence is seen in the absence
of dissipation. The latter conclusion is confirmed with a simple calculation of
the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix.

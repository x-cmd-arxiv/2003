statistical problem because the large photon densities at radio wavelengths
allow the simultaneous detection of the three Stokes parameters which
completely describe the radiation's polarization. The statistical nature of the
problem arises from the fluctuating instrumental noise, and possibly from
fluctuations in the radiation's polarization. A statistical model is used to
derive the general, three-dimensional statistics that govern radio polarization
measurements. The statistics are derived for specific cases of source-intrinsic
polarization, with an emphasis on the orthogonal polarization modes in pulsar
radio emission. The statistics are similar to those commonly found in other
fields of the physical, biological, and Earth sciences. Given the highly
variable linear and circular polarization of pulsar radio emission, an
understanding of the three-dimensional statistics may be an essential
prequisite to a thorough interpretation of pulsar polarization data.

white dwarf spin period in V1432 Aql of dP_spin/dt = -5.4 (+3.7/-3.2) 10-9 s/s
from the optical data set alone. This corresponds to a synchronization time
scale tau_sync = 199 (+441/-75) yr, comparable to the time scale of 170 yr for
V1500 Cyg. The synchronization time scale in V1432 Aql is in excellent
agreement with the theoretical prediction from the dominating magnetic torque
in near-synchronous systems. We also present period analyses of optical CCD
photometry and RXTE X-ray data, which argue against the existence of a 4000 s

accretion model also allows to constrain the relevant parameters of the

accessible from space. Nevertheless, there are situations (for example, where
the optical white dwarf spectrum is highly contaminated by the presence of a
companion) in which use of the Lyman series may be essential. Therefore, it is
important to establish whether or not the Lyman lines provide an equally valid
means of measurement. We have already made a first attempt to study this
problem, comparing Lyman line measurements from a variety of far-UV instruments

the use of the Lyman series in more detail from observations of 16 DA white

difference between the Lyman and Balmer line results, the former yielding the

have undertaken a theoretical study of the impact of the accumulating envelope
on the thermal state of the underlying white dwarf (WD). This has allowed us to
find the equilibrium WD core temperatures (T_c), the classical nova ignition
masses (M_ign) and the thermal luminosities for WDs accreting at rates of
10^-11 - 10^-8 Msun/yr. These accretion rates are most appropriate to WDs in

sporadically as dwarf novae. We have included ^3He in the accreted material at
levels appropriate for CVs and find that it significantly modifies the CN

literature and find that the inclusion of ^3He leads to lower M_ign for <Mdot>

test here the hypothesis that it verifies similar properties. Comparable
properties for the dark matter component are also investigated. With this aim,
we have analyzed ROSAT-PSPC images of 24 clusters, and fit a S\'ersic law to
their X-ray surface brightness profiles. We found that: 1) the S\'ersic law
parameters (intensity, shape and scale) describing the X-ray gas emission are
correlated two by two, with a strong correlation between the shape and scale
parameters; 2) the hot gas in all these clusters roughly has the same
integrated specific entropy, although a second order correlation between this
integrated specific entropy and both the gas mass and the dynamical mass is
observed; 3) a scaling law links the cluster potential energy to its total
mass, with the same slope as that derived for elliptical galaxies and for dark
matter halo simulations. Comparable relations are obtained for the dark matter

coexist. Unlike the standard DNOs, the periods of the new type, which we refer
to as longer period DNOs (lpDNOs), are relatively insensitive to accretion
luminosity and can even appear in quiescence of dwarf novae. We interpret them
as magnetically channelled accretion onto the differentially rotating main body
of the white dwarf primary, rather than onto a rapidly slipping equatorial belt
as in the case of the standard DNOs. This is supported by published
measurements of v sin(i) for some of the primaries. Some similarities of the
DNOs, lpDNOs and QPOs in CVs to the three types of QPO in X-Ray binaries (burst
pulsation, high and low frequency QPOs) are noted.

an arc-shaped structure around L1551 NE, open toward L1551 NE, with a size of

features suggest that the CS emission traces the post-shocked region where the
dense gas associated with L1551 NE and the swept-up shell of the outflow from

of the interaction, it is plausible that the formation of L1551 NE was induced
by the outflow impact. The compact structure of L1551 NE with a tiny envelope

lensed background galaxies - is a powerful test for cosmological models.
Previous comparisons of arc statistics for the currently favored concordance
cosmological model (a flat lambda-dominated universe) with observations have
shown an apparently large discrepancy. We present here new ray-shooting
results, based on a high resolution (1024^3 particles in a 320 Mpc/h box)
large-scale structure simulation normalized to the WMAP observations. We follow
light rays through a pseudo-3D matter distribution approximated by up to 38
lens planes, and evaluate the occurrence of arcs for various source redshifts.
We find that the frequency of strongly lensed background sources is a steep
function of source redshift: the optical depth for giant arcs increases by a
factor of five when the background sources are moved from redshift z_s = 1.0 to
z_s = 1.5. This is a consequence of a moderate decrease of the critical surface
mass density for lensing, combined with the very steep cluster mass function at
the high mass end. Our results are consistent with those of Bartelmann et al.
(1998) if we - as they did - restrict all sources to be exactly at z_s = 1. But
if we allow for a more realistic distribution of source redshifts extending to
or beyond z_s > 1.5, the apparent discrepancy vanishes: the frequency of arcs
is increased by about a factor of ten as compared to previous estimates, and
results in roughly one arc per 20 square degrees over the sky. This prediction
for an LCDM model is then in good agreement with the observed frequency of
arcs. Hence we consider the ``missing arc'' problem for a concordance LCDM
cosmology to be solved.

density (Jc) when produced with iron sheath. Because iron is ferromagnetic, it
is expected to improve the field dependence of Jc by shielding of the external
field for low magnetic fields. However, transport and magnetic measurements of
Jc reveal that Jc in MgB2/Fe is improved far beyond the effect of simple
magnetic shielding. The transport measurements in external field show that Jc
initially decreases with the field. This is followed by an increase for
intermediate fields and again a decrease for high fields, resembling the ?peak
effect?. The value of Jc in the field range of this peak effect is higher than
the Jc without iron sheath. The field range of improved Jc widens with
decreasing the temperature, shifting to the higher values of the field. The
explanation of this phenomenon is suggested in terms of a model predicting the
occurrence of overcritical state, as a result of interaction between partly
vortex filled superconductor and a magnet. In this model, the currents are
pushed into vortex-free volume of the superconductor, effectively increasing
its value of loss-free current. The occurrence of the overcritical state is
supported by magnetic measurements of Jc.

averages of such polynomials without a trace define matrix-valued correlation
functions, that depend on the choice of unitary fixing. The unitary fixing is
formulated within the standard Faddeev-Popov framework, in which the squared
Vandermonde determinant emerges as a factor of the complete Faddeev-Popov

  approach","revtex4, 11 pages, 8 EPS figures, improved and extended version",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.68.056301",,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  Incompressible, inviscid, irrotational, and unsteady flows with circulation
$\Gamma$ around a distorted toroidal bubble are considered. A general
variational principle that determines the evolution of the bubble shape is
formulated. For a two-dimensional (2D) cavity with a constant area $A$, exact
pseudo-differential equations of motion are derived, based on variables that
determine a conformal mapping of the unit circle exterior into the region
occupied by the fluid. A closed expression for the Hamiltonian of the 2D system
in terms of canonical variables is obtained. Stability of a stationary drifting
2D hollow vortex is demonstrated, when the circulation is relatively large,
$gA^{3/2}/\Gamma^2\ll 1$. For a circulation-dominated regime of
three-dimensional flows a simplified Lagrangian is suggested, inasmuch as the
bubble shape is well described by the center-line $\g{R}(\xi,t)$ and by an
approximately circular cross-section with relatively small area, $A(\xi,t)\ll
(\oint |\g{R}'|d\xi)^2$. In particular, a finite-dimensional dynamical system
is derived and approximately solved for a vertically moving axisymmetric vortex
ring bubble with a compressed gas inside.

which is used for all event-processing applications in the LHCb experiment. The
existence of an underlying framework allows several common basic services such
as persistency, interactivity, as well as detector geometry description or
particle data to be shared between simulation, reconstruction and analysis
applications. The main benefits of such common services are coherence between
different event-processing stages as well as reduced development effort. The
interfacing to Geant4 toolkit is realized through a facade (GiGa) which
minimizes the coupling to the simulation engine and provides a set of abstract
interfaces for configuration and event-by-event communication. The Gauss
application is composed of three main blocks, i.e. event generation, detector
response simulation and digitization which reflect the different stages
performed during the simulation job. We describe the overall design as well as
the details of Gauss application with a special emphasis on the configuration
and control of the underlying simulation engine. We also briefly mention the
validation strategy and the planing for the LHCb experiment simulation.

be prepared by any thermodynamically reversible classical one-way communication
protocol. We argue that the joint state of two synchronized microscopic clocks
is always of this type when it is considered from the point of view of an
``ignorant'' observer who is not synchronized with the other two parties.
  We show that the entropy generation of a classical one-way synchronization
protocol is at least \Delta S = \hbar^2/(4\Delta E \Delta t)^2 if \Delta t is
the time accuracy of the synchronism and \Delta E is the energy bandwidth of
the clocks. This dissipation can only be avoided if the common time of the
microscopic clocks is stored by an additional classical clock.
  Furthermore, we give a similar bound on the entropy cost for resetting
synchronized clocks by a classical one-way protocol. The proof relies on
observations of Zurek on the thermodynamic relevance of quantum discord. We
leave it as an open question whether classical multi-step protocols may perform
better.
  We discuss to what extent our results imply problems for classical concepts
of reversible computation when the energy of timing signals is close to the
Heisenberg limit.

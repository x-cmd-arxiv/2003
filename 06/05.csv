simple, it has the benign property of only having four free parameters (the
outer radius of the beam, the axial velocity, the velocity at the edge of the

radial velocity and line width cross sections of an observed outflow. We
illustrate how to do such fits using previously published spectroscopic data of

The current set of dynamical models do provide accurate estimates of the black

able to measure the black hole mass to about 20%--30% accuracy given present
observations, and the stellar orbital structure to about 20% accuracy in the
radial to tangential dispersions. The stellar orbital structure of the stars
near the galaxy center show strong tangential velocity anisotropy for most

binary/merger models. There is also a strong correlation between black hole
mass and the contribution of radial motion at large radii. This correlation may
be an important aspect of galaxy evolution.

preceded by few weak and soft short bursts. After having detected the X and
gamma prompt emission of the flare, BeppoSAX pointed its narrow field X-ray
telescopes to the source in less than 8 hours. In this paper we present an
analysis of the data from this and from a subsequent BeppoSAX observation, as
well as from a set of RossiXTE observations. Our data show the detection of an
X-ray afterglow from the source, most likely related to the large hard X-ray
flare. In fact, the persistent flux from the source, in 2-10 keV, was initially
found at a level $\sim$5 times higher than the usual value. Assuming an
underlying persistent (constant) emission, the decay of the excess flux can be
reasonably well described by a t$^{-0.9}$ law. A temporal feature - a
$\sim$half a day long bump - is observed in the decay light curve approximately
one day after the burst onset. This feature is unprecedented in SGR afterglows.
We discuss our results in the context of previous observations of this source
and derive implications for the physics of these objects.

among these objects. Furthermore, we find a significant difference in Halpha
spectropolarimetry behaviour between the Herbig Be and Ae groups. For the
Herbig Be stars, the concept of an electron scattering disc is shown to be a
useful concept to explain the depolarizations seen in this spectral range. At
lower masses, more complex Halpha polarimetry behaviour starts to appear. The
concept of a compact source of Halpha emission that is formed close to the
stellar surface, for instance by hot spots due to magnetospheric accretion, is
postulated as a working hypothesis to qualitatively explain the Halpha

Tauri stars. The striking resemblance in spectropolarimetric behaviour between
the T Tauri star RY Tau and the Herbig Ae stars suggests a common origin of the

structure provide useful constraints on a range of cosmological parameters.
However, the ultimate succes of this technique depends on the accuracy with
which one can correct for the effect of the Point Spread Function (PSF). In
this paper we examine the accuracy of the PSF anisotropy correction using
images of fields with a large number of stars. The ellipticity correlation
function of the residuals is studied to quantify the effect of imperfect
corrections for PSF anisotropy on cosmic shear studies. These imperfections
occur on the chip scale and consequently the systematic signal decreases
rapidly with increasing angular scale. Separation of the signal into ``E''
(curl-free) and ``B'' (curl) components can help to identify the presence of
residual systematics, but in general, the amplitude of the ``B''-mode is
different from that of the ``E''-mode. The study of fields with many stars can
be beneficial in finding a proper description of the variation of PSF
anisotropy, and consequently help to significantly improve the accuracy with
which the cosmic shear signal can be measured. We show that with such an
approach it is feasible that the accuracy of future cosmic shear studies is
limited by the statistical noise introduced by the intrinsic shapes of the
sources. In particular, the prospects for accurate measurements of the cosmic
shear signal on scales larger than ~10 arcminutes are excellent.

models which extend radially one order of magnitude farther out than our
previous models. Our main result is that the inclusion of a disk wind at larger
radii changes qualitatively and quantitatively the line profiles predicted by
the models. Our new models predict line absorption that is significantly
stronger than those predicted by old models. Some of the previous line profiles
exhibit a doubled-humped structure near the line center which is now replaced
by a more plausible single, blueshifted minimum. We emphasize that the
improvements in the shape as well as the strength of the absorption were
achieved without changing the gross properties of the wind. In particular, our
new models do not predict a higher mass-loss rate than the previous models. The
main changes in the line profiles are due to the fact that the ratio between
the rotational velocity and poloidal velocity of the wind decreases downstream.
The new line profiles reproduce well the line absorption of the nova-like
variable, IX~Vel, and promise to reproduce observations of other cataclysmic
variables. This success of the radiation driven disk wind model provides an
important link between outflows in OB stars and outflows in active galactic

R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars which provide the first strong evidence that
most, if not all, RCB stars have winds. It has long been suggested that when
dust forms around an RCB star, radiation pressure accelerates the dust away
from the star, dragging the gas along with it. The new spectra show that nine
of the ten stars observed have P-Cygni or asymmetric blue-shifted profiles in
the He I $\lambda$10830 line. In all cases, the He I line indicates a mass
outflow - with a range of intensity and velocity. Around the RCB stars, it is
likely that this state is populated by collisional excitation rather than
photoionization/recombination. The line profiles have been modeled with an SEI
code to derive the optical depth and the velocity field of the helium gas. The
results show that the typical RCB wind has a steep acceleration with a terminal
velocity of \Vinf = 200-350 \kms and a column density of N $\sim10^{12}$
cm$^{-2}$ in the He I $\lambda$10830 line. There is a possible relationship
between the lightcurve of an RCB star and its He I $\lambda$10830 profile.
Stars which have gone hundreds of days with no dust-formation episodes tend to
have weaker He I features. The unusual RCB star, V854 Cen, does not follow this
trend, showing little or no He I absorption despite high mass-loss activity.
The He I $\lambda$10830 line in R CrB itself, which has been observed at four

evaluated from cosmological N-body simulations. This approach enables one to
incorporate both asymmetries in the projected mass density and elongations
along the line-of-sight analytically, for the first time in cosmological lensed
arc statistics. As expected, triaxial dark matter halos significantly increase
the number of arcs relative to spherical models; the difference amounts to more
than one order of magnitude while the value of enhancement depends on the
specific properties of density profiles. Then we compare our theoretical
predictions with the observed number of arcs from 38 X-ray selected clusters.
In contrast to the previous claims, our triaxial dark matter halos with inner

rest-frame optical light measured through the asymmetry parameter (A) to
determine the fraction of galaxies undergoing major mergers as a function of
redshift (z), stellar mass (M_{*}), and absolute magnitude (M_{B}). We find
that the fraction of galaxies consistent with undergoing a major merger
increases with redshift for all galaxies, but most significantly, at 5 - 10

merger fraction evolution in the form: f x (1+z)^m, finding m values ~4-6 for
the most luminous and massive galaxies. We use these merger fractions combined
with merger time scales calculated from N-body simulations to derive galaxy
merger rates to z ~ 3. We also use stellar masses of HDF-N galaxies to
determine the mass accretion rate of field galaxies involved in major mergers,
and how this changes with redshift. We further find that the fraction of
stellar mass density in galaxies involved in major mergers increases with
redshift. By comparing merger fractions predicted in Cold Dark Matter
semi-analytic models with our results there is a reasonably good agreement for
the largest and brightest systems, although there are more low-mass galaxy

extinction towards this object to be A_V=7.5 +/- 0.4 mag and derived a distance
of 2.2 +/- 0.4 kpc, assuming a luminosity of 10^4 L_sol. The near-infrared
spectrum shows strong H_2 emission lines and some typical metastable shock
excited lines such as [Fe II] 1.257 & 1.644 micron. We determined the
rotational and vibrational excitation temperatures, as well as the
ortho-to-para ratio of the molecular hydrogen. Based on these we argue that the
H_2 emission is mainly collisionally excited. Line ratios indicate that the H_2
emission originates in a +/- 25 km/s C-type shock. On the other hand, the
metastable lines, and especially the [Fe II] emission lines, indicate the
presence of a +/- 75 km/s J-type shock. Hence we postulate that the H_2
emission originates where the stellar wind (with an observed terminal velocity
of +/- 126 km/s) is funneled through an equatorial density enhancement,
impinging almost tangentially upon the circumstellar material. The [Fe II]
emission either occurs along the walls of the bipolar lobes where the
transverse shock velocity would be higher, or could originate much closer to
the central star in shocks in the post-AGB wind itself, or possibly even an
accretion disk. Further high resolution near-infrared spectra are currently
being obtained to confirm the proposed geometry and kinematics.

anharmonicity, introduced within an attractive Hubbard Hamiltonian for bosons,
is responsible for the formation of bound states which belong to a finite
linewidth band located below the continuum of two-vibron free states. The decay
of these bound states into either bound or free states, is described by
considering the coupling between the vibrons and a thermal bath formed by a set
of low frequency acoustic phonons. The relaxation rate is expressed in terms of
the spectral distribution of the vibron/phonon coupling and of the two-vibron
Green operator which is calculated exactly by using the number states method.
The behavior of the two-vibron bound states relaxation rate is analyzed with a
special emphasis on the influence of the anharmonicity. It is shown that the
rate exhibits two distinct regimes depending on the thermal bath dimension.
When the bath dimension is equal to unity, the rate increases with the
anharmonicity and the decay of the two-vibron bound states into the other bound
states appears as the main contribution of the rate. By contrast, when the bath
dimension is equal to 2 and 3, the rate decreases as the anharmonicity
increases indicating that the two-vibron bound states decay into the two-vibron
free states continuum.

investigated within a realistic model with stringent microscopically derived
coupling interaction potential and effective on-site potential. The coupling
interaction characterizing the chain rigidity and the effective on-site
potentials are calculated for three main types of protein secondary structure.
The coupling interaction is found to be surprisingly weak for all of them but
different in character: repulsive for alpha-helix and anti-parallel beta-sheet
structures and attractive for parallel beta-sheet structure. The effective
on-site potential is found to be a hard one for alpha-helix and anti-parallel
beta-sheet and a soft one for parallel beta-sheet. In all three types of
protein secondary structures a stable zig-zag shape discrete breather (DB)
associated with the oscillations of torsional (dihedral) angles can exist due
to weakness of the coupling interaction. However, since the absorption of far
infrared radiation (IR) by proteins is known to require the existence of rather
long chains of hydrogen bonds that takes place only in alpha-helicies, then one
can conclude that the excitation of a DB in such a way is possible in
alpha-helix and seems to be hardly possible in beta-sheet structures. The
interpretation of the recent experiments of Xie et al. on far IR laser pulse
spectroscopy of proteins is suggested. The frequency of a DB in an the
alpha-helix is obtained in the region of 115 cm^{-1} in accordance with these

experimental results are reproduced by an extended lattice gas model taking
into account the empirically observed behavior. Our particular focus is on the
mean value and distribution of escape times. For a large number of people in
the room, the escape time distribution is wide because of jamming.
Surprisingly, adding more exits does not improve the situation in the expected
way, since most people use the exit that is discovered first, which may be
viewed as ``herding effect'' based on accoustic interactions. Moreover, the
average escape time becomes minimal for a certain finite number of people in
the dark or smoky room. These non-linear effects have practical implications
for emergency evacuation and the planning of safer buildings.

studied using the extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model as well as the
improved ladder approximation (ILA) of QCD with U_A(1) symmetry breaking
interaction. The U_A(1) breaking is represented by the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t
Hooft (KMT) interaction. The strength of the KMT interaction in the NJL model
is determined so as to reproduce the electromagnetic decays of the \eta meson.
That in the ILA approach is determined so as to reproduce the pseudoscalar
meson spectrum.
  In the extended NJL model, we study the qualitative features of the scalar
meson spectrum. In the scalar nonet spectrum, the KMT interaction is found to
give the right ordering of \sigma - a_0 masses and a few hundred MeV mass
difference between the \sigma and a_0 mesons. We also find that the strangeness
content in the \sigma meson is about 15%.
  In the ILA approach, we confirm the qualitative features of the results from
the extended NJL. We obtain the mass spectra of the light pseudoscalar nonet
mesons and the \sigma, a_0 mesons which are consistent with current
experimental data. On the other hand, we show that the obtained f_0 and K_0^*
state can not be identified directly with the experimental data. It may suggest
that the f_0(980) and \kappa(700-900) states may not be explained only by the
quark-anti quark state.
  We also find that the strangeness content in the \sigma meson is about 5%. We
obtain the result that the U_A(1) breaking interaction reproducing the mass
spectrum of the pseudoscalar meson gives large effects on the scalar meson mass
spectrum.

inconsistent. The inclusion of specific additional scalar and p-form matter can
change the situation. For example, a D-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton
system, with a specific dilaton coupling, is known to admit a consistent
reduction on S^2= SU(2)/U(1), of a sort first envisaged by Pauli. We provide a
new understanding, by showing how an S^3=SU(2) group-manifold reduction of
(D+1)-dimensional Einstein gravity, of a type first indicated by DeWitt, can be
broken into in two steps; a Kaluza-type reduction on U(1) followed by a
Pauli-type coset reduction on S^2. More generally, we show that any
D-dimensional theory that itself arises as a Kaluza U(1) reduction from (D+1)
dimensions admits a consistent Pauli reduction on any coset of the form G/U(1).
Extensions to the case G/H are given. Pauli coset reductions of the bosonic
string on G= (G\times G)/G are believed to be consistent, and a consistency
proof exists for S^3=SO(4)/SO(3). We examine these reductions, and arguments
for consistency, in detail. The structures of the theories obtained instead by
DeWitt-type group-manifold reductions of the bosonic string are also studied,
allowing us to make contact with previous such work in which only singlet
scalars are retained. Consistent truncations with two singlet scalars are
possible. Intriguingly, despite the fact that these are not supersymmetric
models, if the group manifold has dimension 3 or 25 they admit a superpotential
formulation, and hence first-order equations yielding domain-wall solutions.

The NC effects appear as (NC parameter) $\theta $-dependent interaction terms.
The expressions for static energy, obtained from both the symmetric and

spatial noncommutativity is present. Bogomolny analysis reveals a lower bound
in the energy in an unambiguous way, suggesting the presence of a new soliton.
However, the BPS equations saturating the bound are not compatible to the full

finite volumes in terms of the gap of the two-site Hamiltonian. The estimate is
derived by a method developed by Nachtergaele in (cond-mat/9410110) called the
Martingale Method. Our bound relies on an assumption which we have, as yet,
been unable to verify analytically in all cases. We present numerical evidence
that strongly indicates our assumption is valid.
  The second result is a proof that the spin-1/2, d-dimensional XY model in the
presence of an external magnetic field does not undergo a phase transition at
low temperature, provided that the strength of the field is great enough. Using
a contour expansion inspired by Kennedy, we show that the weights of contours
satisfy a condition of Kotecky and Preiss which allows us to express the free
energy of the system as a cluster expansion. As part of the setup we give a
simple proof that the all-spin-up state is the unique ground state when the
external magnetic field has strength at least 2d.

contributions for the study of the degrees of freddom relevant for the

described by the spectrum generating algebra U(4) and the Vibron Model, is a
most natural concept in molecular physics. It has been suggested by Iachello
with much debate, to be most important for understanding the low lying
structure of nuclei and other hadrons. After its first observation in $^{18}O$
it was also shown to be relevant for the structure of heavy nuclei (e.g.
$^{218}Ra$). Much like the Ar-benzene molecule, it is shown that molecular
configurations are important near threshold as exhibited by states with a large
halo and strong electric dipole transitions. The cluster-molecular Sum Rule
derived by Alhassid, Gai and Bertsch (AGB) is shown to be a very useful model
independent tool for examining such dipole molecular structure near thereshold.
Accordingly, the dipole strength observed in the halo nuclei such as $^6He,
^{11}Li, ^{11}Be, ^{17}O$, as well as the N=82 isotones is concentrated around
threshold and it exhausts a large fraction (close to 100%) of the AGB sum rule,
but a small fraction (a few percent) of the TRK sum rule. This is suggested as
an evidence for a new soft dipole Vibron like oscillations in nuclei.

many-body calculations since it has no quadratic momentum-dependent terms in
S-waves. However, p**2 rather than L**2 dependence occurs naturally in
meson-exchange models of nuclear forces. We construct an alternate version of
the Argonne potential, designated Argonne v18pq, in which the L**2 and (L.S)**2

on the IMF. The conditions of this current closure through the body of the
magnetosphere are discussed. It is shown that the process of penetration of the
external current into magnetized plasma has a two-stage character. Initially, a
change in current on the boundary gives rise to a region of surface charge, the
field of which polarizes the near-wall layer with the thickness on the order of
one gyroradius of protons. The polarization process involves the formation of
the displacement current which produces the Ampere force accelerating the
plasma inside the double layer. When the plasma velocity reaches the electric
drift velocity (within a time on the order of the inverse gyrofrequency of
protons), the electric field in this plasma disappears, whereas in a fixed
frame of reference, on the contrary, it reaches equilibrium values. The front
of variation of the electric field penetrates the plasma with the velocity of a
fast magnetosonic wave. A change in the convection velocity field causes a
redistribution of plasma pressure. The appearance of corresponding gradients
signifies the penetration of current into plasma. The gradients are changing
until a new steady state is reached, to which the new convection velocity field
and the new plasma pressure field correspond. This new state is reached in a
time which is estimated.

vibron-phonon coupling on the two-vibron dynamics in an $\alpha$-helix protein
is studied within a modified Davydov model. The intramolecular anharmonicity of
each amide-I vibration is considered and the vibron dynamics is described
according to the small polaron approach. A unitary transformation is performed
to remove the intramolecular anharmonicity and a modified Lang-Firsov
transformation is applied to renormalize the vibron-phonon interaction. Then, a
mean field procedure is realized to obtain the dressed anharmonic vibron
Hamiltonian. It is shown that the anharmonicity modifies the vibron-phonon
interaction which results in an enhancement of the dressing effect. In
addition, both the anharmonicity and the dressing favor the occurrence of two
different bound states which the properties strongly depend on the interplay
between the anharmonicity and the dressing. Such a dependence was summarized in
a phase diagram which characterizes the number and the nature of the bound
states as a function of the relevant parameters of the problem. For a
significant anharmonicity, the low frequency bound states describe two vibrons
trapped onto the same amide-I vibration whereas the high frequency bound states
refer to the trapping of the two vibrons onto nearest neighbor amide-I
vibrations.

understanding the spin statistics connection in non-relativistic quantum
mechanics. Allen and Mondragon [2] has pointed out correctly some of the flaws
in Peshkin's arguments which are based on the single valuedness under rotation
of the wave functions of systems of identical particles. We examine carefully
the claim that is made in the title of [2] that there can be ``no
spin-statistics connection in non-relativistic quantum mechanics''. We show
that we can derive the spin statistics connection for non-relativistic quantum
field theories which have equations of motion of the Hamiltonian type based on
SU(2) invariance of the Lagrangian. The formalism and machinary of
non-relativistic quantum field theory as opposed to usual quantum mechanics is
necessary for constructing our proof.

doubled in quantum channels, the amount of information transmitted can be
increased more than twice by quantum channel coding technique, whereas the
increase is at most twice in classical information theory. This remarkable
feature, the superadditive quantum coding gain, can be implemented by
appropriate choices of code words and corresponding quantum decoding which
requires a collective quantum measurement. Recently, the first experimental
demonstration was reported [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 167906 (2003)]. The purpose of
this paper is to describe our experiment in detail. Particularly, a design
strategy of quantum collective decoding in physical quantum circuits is
emphasized. We also address the practical implication of the gain on
communication performance by introducing the quantum-classical hybrid coding
scheme. We show how the superadditive quantum coding gain, even in a small code
length, can boost the communication performance of conventional coding
technique.

In this paper we discuss the situation where the state of the atoms leaving the
cavity is reduced but the outcome is not recorded. In this case our knowledge
is limited to an ensemble description of the results only. By applying the
Demkov-Kunike level-crossing model, we show that even in this case, the
filtering action of the interaction allows us to prepare a preassigned Fock
state with good accuracy. The possibilities and limitations of the method are
discussed and some relations to earlier work are presented.

(Gaussian) distribution, because of the central limit theorem. In the quantum
theory, the analogous hypothesis is that the matrix elements of the error in an
observable are distributed normally. We obtain the probability distribution
this implies for the outcome of a measurement, exactly for the case of 2x2
matrices and in the steepest descent approximation in general. Due to the
phenomenon of `level repulsion', the probability distributions obtained are
quite different from the Gaussian.

effect in the case of real metals is elaborated starting from the free energy
of oscillators. The Lifshitz formula expressed in terms of the dielectric
permittivity depending only on frequency is shown to be inapplicable in the
frequency region where a real current may arise leading to Joule heating of the
metal. The standard concept of a fluctuating electromagnetic field on such
frequencies meets difficulties when used as a model for the zero-point
oscillations or thermal photons in the thermal equilibrium inside metals.
Instead, the surface impedance permits not to consider the electromagnetic
oscillations inside the metal but taking the realistic material properties into
account by means of the effective boundary condition. An independent derivation
of the Lifshitz-type formulas for the Casimir free energy and force between two
metal plates is presented within the impedance approach. It is shown that they
are free of the contradictions with thermodynamics which are specific to the
usual Lifshitz formula for dielectrics in combination with the Drude model. We
demonstrate that in the impedance approach the zero-frequency contribution is
uniquely fixed by the form of impedance function and does not need any of the
ad hoc prescriptions intensively discussed in the recent literature. As an
example, the computations of the Casimir free energy between two gold plates
are performed at different separations and temperatures. It is argued that the
surface impedance approach lays a reliable framework for the future
measurements of the thermal Casimir force.

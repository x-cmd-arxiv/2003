it using the aperture mass-radius relations determined from the geometries of
22 gravitational lenses. The model consists of two components: a concentrated
component which traces the light distribution, and a more extended power-law
component (rho propto r^-n) which represents the dark matter. We find that lens
galaxies have total mass profiles which are nearly isothermal, or slightly
steeper, on the several-kiloparsec radial scale spanned by the lensed images.
In the limit of a single-component, power-law radial profile, the model implies
n=2.07+/-0.13, consistent with isothermal (n=2). Models in which mass traces
light are excluded at >99 percent confidence. An n=1 cusp (such as the
Navarro-Frenk-White profile) requires a projected dark matter mass fraction of
f_cdm = 0.22+/-0.10 inside 2 effective radii. These are the best statistical
constraints yet obtained on the mass profiles of lenses, and provide clear
evidence for a small but non-zero dark matter mass fraction in the inner
regions of early-type galaxies. In addition, we derive the first strong lensing
constraint on the relation between stellar mass-to-light ratio (Upsilon) and
galaxy luminosity (L): Upsilon propto L^[0.14 (+0.16)(-0.12)], which is
consistent with the relation suggested by the fundamental plane. Finally, we
apply our self-similar mass models to current problems regarding the
interpretation of time delays and flux ratio anomalies in gravitational lens
systems.

  original version to accommodate comments of referee)","Astrophys.J. 594 (2003) L47-L50","10.1086/378400",,"astro-ph",,"  In this Letter we propose a new view on UX Orionis type variability. The idea
is based on the earlier proposal by various authors that UXORs are
nearly-edge-on disks in which hydrodynamic fluctuations could cause clumps of
dust and gas to cross the line of sight. However, because the standard disk
models have a flaring geometry, it is mostly the outer regions of the disk that
obscure the star. The time scales for such obscuration events would be too long
to match the observed time scales of weeks to months. Recent 2-D
self-consistent models of Herbig Ae/Be protoplanetary disks (Dullemond et al.
2002,2003 henceforth D02/DD03), however, have indicated that for Herbig Ae/Be
star disks there exists, in addition to the usual flared disks, also a new
class of disks: those that are fully self-shadowed. Only their puffed-up inner
rim (at the dust evaporation radius) is directly irradiated by the star, while
the disk at larger radius resides in the shadow of the rim. For these disks
there exist inclinations at which the line of sight towards the star skims the
upper parts of the puffed-up inner rim, while passing high over the surface of
outer disk regions. Small hydrodynamic fluctuations in the puffed-up inner rim
could then be held responsible for the extinction events seen in UXORs. If this
idea is correct, it makes a prediction for the shape of the SEDs of these
stars. It was shown by D02/DD03 that flared disks have a strong far-IR excess
and can be classified as `group I' (in the classification of Meeus et al.
2001), while self-shadowed disks have a relatively weak far-IR excess and are
classified as `group II'. Our model therefore predicts that UXORs belong to the
`group II' sources. We show that this correlation is indeed found within a
sample of 86 Herbig Ae/Be stars.

We find that the ejecta close to the ""jet"" region in the NE, but not actually
in the jet itself, have a systematically shallower outer envelope than ejecta
elsewhere in the remnant, and we interpret this as being due to more energy of
the initial explosion being directed in this polar direction as opposed to
equatorially. The degree of asymmetry we infer is at the low end of that
generally modelled in asymmetric core-collapse simulations, and may possibly be
used to rule out highly asymmetric explosion models.

speed, rotation law, and amplitude of bar mode perturbation. The simulations
show that the cloud fragments whenever the cloud rotates sufficiently slowly to
allow collapse but fast enough to form a disk before first-core formation. The
latter condition is equivalent to $\Omega_0 t_{\rm ff} \gtrsim 0.05$, where
$\Omega_0$ and $t_{\rm ff}$ denote the initial central angular velocity and the
freefall time measured from the central density, respectively. Fragmentation is
classified into six types: disk-bar, ring-bar, satellite, bar, ring, and
dumbbell types according to the morphology of collapse and fragmentation. When
the outward decrease in initial angular velocity is more steep, the cloud
deforms from spherical at an early stage. The cloud deforms into a ring only
when the bar mode m = 2 perturbation is very minor. The ring fragments into two
or three fragments via ring-bar type fragmentation and into at least three
fragments via ring type fragmentation. When the bar mode is significant, the
cloud fragments into two fragments via either bar or dumbbell type
fragmentation. These fragments eventually merge due to their low angular
momenta, after which several new fragments form around the merged fragment via

the second case of a relativistic X-ray absorbing outflow in a BAL quasar. The
first case was revealed in a recent observation of APM 08279+5255 with the
Chandra X-ray Observatory. The spectrum of PG1115+080 indicates the presence of
complex low-energy absorption in the 0.2-0.6 keV observed energy band and
high-energy absorption in the 2-5 keV observed energy band. The high-energy
absorption is best modeled by two Gaussian absorption lines with rest-frame
energies of 7.4 keV and 9.5 keV. Assuming that these two lines are produced by
resonant absorption due to Fe xxv Kalpha, we infer that the X-ray absorbers are
outflowing with velocities of ~0.10c and ~0.34c, respectively. We have detected
significant variability of the energies and widths of the X-ray BALs in PG

small radii of ~ 10^(16)(M_BH/M_8)^(1/2)cm. A comparison of the ionization
properties and column densities of the low-energy and high-energy absorbers
indicates that these absorbers are likely distinct; however, higher spectral
resolution is needed to confirm this result. Finally, we comment on prospects

When compared to Praesepe members, the Pleiades K dwarfs again are subluminous
(or blue) in a color-magnitude diagram using B-V as the color index. However,
using V-I as the color index, stars in the two clusters are coincident to M_V ~

spectral energy distributions for the Pleiades K dwarfs, as compared to older

to spottedness. If so, the required areal filling factor for the cool component
has to be very large (=> 50%). Weak-lined T Tauri stars have similar color
anomalies, and we suspect this is a common feature of all very young K dwarfs
(sp. type > K3). The peculiar spectral energy distribution needs to be
considered in deriving accurate pre-main sequence isochrone-fitting ages for
clusters like the Pleiades since the age derived will depend on the temperature

at ~13 arcsec away from the core. The knot emission is consistent with the

which are as much as a factor of two smaller. The smallest closest approach is
achieved by S0-16, which confines the mass to within a radius of a mere 45 AU
and increases the inferred dark mass density by four orders of magnitude
compared to earlier analyses based on velocity and acceleration vectors, making
the Milky Way the strongest existing case by far for a supermassive black hole
at the center of any normal type galaxy. The stellar orbital properties suggest
that the distributions of eccentricities and angular momentum vector and
apoapse directions are consistent with those of an isotropic system. Therefore
many of the mechanisms proposed for the formation of young stars in the
vicinity of a supermassive black hole, such as formation from a pre-existing
disk, are unlikely solutions for the Sgr A* cluster stars. Unfortunately, all
existing alternative theories are also somewhat problematic. Understanding the
apparent youth of stars in the Sgr A* cluster, as well as the more distant He I
emission line stars, has now become one of the major outstanding issues in the
study of the Galactic Center.

Space is partitioned into cells the shape of rhombic dodecahedron. The cells
are labelled ``filled'' or ``empty'' according as they contain galaxies or not.
The cell size is so chosen as to have nearly equal numbers of filled and empty
cells for the given galaxy sample. Two observables on each cell are definable:
the number of its {\em like} neighbors, $n_1$, and a two-suffixed topological
type $\tau$, the suffixes being the numbers of its like and unlike {\em
neighbor-groups}. The frequency distributions of $n_1$ and $\tau$ in the
observed set of filled (empty) cells are then considered as indicators of the
morphology of the set. The method is applied to the CfA catalogue of galaxies
as an illustration. Despite its limited size the data offers evidence 1) that
the empty cells are more strongly clustered than the filled cells, and 2) that
the filled cells, but not the empty cells, have a tendency of occurring in
sheets. Further directions of development both in theory and application are
indicated.

applied qualitatively to Resonant Sideband Extraction (RSE). Several beneficial
properties anticipated for DR detectors are investigated: signal response
tuning and narrowbanding, power loss reduction, and the reclamation of lost

would be limited by large scattering losses in large (multi-kilometer) systems.
Furthermore, losses may be resonantly enhanced (particularly for RSE), if the

make two principal recommendations for DR/RSE interferometers: the DR/RSE

279 and 3C 273, and other active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Particles from an
accretion disk surrounding the black hole fall into the ergosphere and scatter
off particles that are in trapped or bound unstable orbits. The Penrose
mechanism allows rotational energy of a Kerr black hole, and energy-momentum
produced by its strong gravitational field, to be extracted by scattered
particles escaping from the ergosphere to infinity. The results of these model
calculations show that the Penrose mechanism is capable of producing the
observed high energy particles (~GeV) emitted by quasars and other AGNs. This
mechanism can extract hard X-ray/gamma-ray photons from PCS of initially
infalling low energy UV/soft X-ray photons by target orbiting electrons in the
ergosphere. The PPP allows the escape of relativistic e-e+ pairs--produced by
infalling low energy photons interacting with highly blueshifted target photons
at the photon orbit. Moreover, and importantly, the emission of scattered
particles by this mechanism naturally produces relativistic jets collimated
about the polar axis, and in most cases one-sided or asymmetrical, agreeing
with observations of AGNs. In these fully relativistic calculations, the

disk which is truncated at an outer radius of 700pc. The total molecular gas
mass is distributed in a lopsided nuclear disk of 40pc radius and two one-arm
spirals, which develop at different radii in the disk. The distribution and
kinematics of molecular gas in the inner 1kpc of NGC4826 show the prevalence of
different types of m=1 perturbations in the gas. Although dominated by
rotation, the gas kinematics are perturbed by streaming motions related to the
m=1 instabilities. The non-circular motions associated with the inner m=1
perturbations agree qualitatively with the pattern expected for a trailing wave
developed outside corotation ('fast' wave). In contrast, the streaming motions
in the outer m=1 spiral are better explained by a 'slow' wave. A paradoxical
consequence is that the inner m=1 perturbations would not favour AGN feeding.
An independent confirmation that the AGN is not being generously fueled at
present is found in the low values of the gravitational torques exerted by the
stellar potential for R<530pc. The distribution of star formation in the disk
of NGC4826 is also strongly asymmetrical. Massive star formation is still
vigorous, fed by the significant molecular gas reservoir at R<700pc. There is
supporting evidence for a recent large mass inflow episode in NGC4826.

concerns expressed by Armitage and Hu that our results could be due to a change

the relationship and contrast of effects due to time reversal symmetry breaking
and those caused by crystallographic changes. In any test of time reversal
symmetry one must ensure that parity alone is not inducing the observed
changes. We have indeed considered this issue very carefully in the course of
our study [2] and it is precisely the lack of temperature dependent structural
changes significant enough to explain the magnitude of the observed dichroism
that forced us to conclude that time reversal symmetry breaking is the only
plausible explanation. Furthermore, recent experiments by Borisenko, et al. [4]

computed the dynamical charge correlation function, spectral density, and
optical conductivity using Lanczos diagonalization and large-N techniques. As
the ratio of the nearest-neighbour Coulomb repulsion, V, to the hopping
integral, t, increases there is a transition from a metallic phase to a charge
ordered phase. Dynamical properties close to the ordering transition are found
to differ from the ones expected in a conventional metal. Large-N calculations
display an enhancement of spectral weight at low frequencies as the system is
driven closer to the charge ordering transition in agreement with Lanczos
calculations. As V is increased the charge correlation function displays a
plasmon-like mode which, for wavevectors close to (pi,pi), increases in
amplitude and softens as the charge ordering transition is approached. We
propose that inelastic X-ray scattering be used to detect this mode. Large-N
calculations predict superconductivity with dxy symmetry close to the ordering
transition. We find that this is consistent with Lanczos diagonalization
calculations, on lattices of 20 sites, which find that the binding energy of

to extend this Hartree approximated scheme to arrive at a generalized mean
field theory of pseudogapped superconductors for all temperatures $T$. While an
equivalent approach to the pseudogap has been derived elsewhere using a more
formal Green's function decoupling scheme, in this paper we re-interpret this
mean field theory and BCS theory as well, and demonstrate how they naturally
relate to ideal Bose gas condensation. Here we recast the Hartree approximated
Ginzburg-Landau self consistent equations in a T-matrix form. This recasting
makes it possible to consider arbitrarily strong attractive coupling, where
bosonic degrees of freedom appear at $ T^*$ considerably above $T_c$. The
implications for transport both above and below $T_c$ are discussed. Below
$T_c$ we find two types of contributions. Those associated with fermionic
excitations have the usual BCS functional form. That they depend on the
magnitude of the excitation gap, nevertheless, leads to rather atypical
transport properties in the strong coupling limit, where this gap (as distinct
from the order parameter) is virtually $T$-independent. In addition, there are
bosonic terms arising from non-condensed pairs whose transport properties are
shown here to be reasonably well described by an effective time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau theory.

Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit coupling mechanisms are shown to be rather
efficient for this purpose. The spin response to a perpendicular-to-plane
electric field is due to a deviation from the strict 2D limit and is controlled
by the ratios of the spin, cyclotron and confinement frequencies. The
dependence of this response on the magnetic field direction is indicative of
the strenghts of the competing spin-orbit coupling mechanisms.

three QCD models which include a simulation of color reconnection: one in the

that the description of inclusive Z0 data is significantly degraded in this

disfavored. The signal from the Herwig color reconnection model is less clear
and we do not obtain a definite conclusion concerning this model. In a separate

the same renormalization, up to lattice spacing errors of order O(a^2). The
DBW2 gauge action provides enhancement of the good chiral symmetry properties
of domain wall fermions at larger lattice spacing than the conventional Wilson

the evolution of the massive star and its presupernova structure, which is

density profile of the mantle affects the dynamics of neutrino oscillation in
supernova. Second, the final iron core structure determines the features of the

half-dimensional torus with non-empty fixed point set and some additional
orientation data. It may be considered as a far-reaching generalisation of
toric manifolds from algebraic geometry. The orbit space of a torus manifold
has a rich combinatorial structure, e.g., it is a manifold with corners
provided that the action is locally standard. Here we investigate relationships
between the cohomological properties of torus manifolds and the combinatorics
of their orbit quotients. We show that the cohomology ring of a torus manifold
is generated by two-dimensional classes if and only if the quotient is a
homology polytope. In this case we retrieve the familiar picture from toric
geometry: the equivariant cohomology is the face ring of the nerve simplicial
complex and the ordinary cohomology is obtained by factoring out certain linear
forms. In a more general situation, we show that the odd-degree cohomology of a
torus manifold vanishes if and only if the orbit space is face-acyclic.
Although the cohomology is no longer generated in degree two under these
circumstances, the equivariant cohomology is still isomorphic to the face ring
of an appropriate simplicial poset.

targets induced by 14 MeV neutrons. The isoscaling behavior was typically
observed for the isotopic chains of fragments ranging from the proton-rich to
the most neutron-rich ones. The observed high sensitivity of neutron-rich heavy
fragments to the target neutron content suggests fission as a source of
neutron-rich heavy nuclei for present and future rare ion beam facilities,
allowing studies of nuclear properties towards the neutron drip-line and
investigations of the conditions for nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei. The
breakdowns of the isoscaling behavior around N=62 and N=80 manifest the effect
of two shell closures on the dynamics of scission. The shell closure around
N=64 can be explained by the deformed shell. The investigation of isoscaling in
the spontaneous fission of 248,244Cm further supports such conclusion. The
Z-dependence of the isoscaling parameter exhibits a structure which can be
possibly related to details of scission dynamics. The fission isoscaling
studies can be a suitable tool for the investigation of possible new pathways
to synthesize still heavier nuclei.

which Arthur receives multiple quantum proofs that are unentangled with each
other. Although classical multi-proof systems are obviously equivalent to
classical single-proof systems (i.e., usual Merlin-Arthur proof systems), it is
unclear whether or not quantum multi-proof systems collapse to quantum
single-proof systems (i.e., usual quantum Merlin-Arthur proof systems). This
paper presents a necessary and sufficient condition under which the number of
quantum proofs is reducible to two. It is also proved that, in the case of
perfect soundness, using multiple quantum proofs does not increase the power of
quantum Merlin-Arthur proof systems.

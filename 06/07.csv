optical afterglow of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 030329 with the 1.5m Russian-Turkish
telescope RTT150 (TUBITAK National Observatory, Bakyrlytepe, Turkey). RTT150
was one of the first 1.5m-class telescopes pointed to the afterglow.
Observations were started approximately 6 hours after the burst. During the
first 5 hours of our observations the afterglow faded exactly as a power law
with index -1.19+-0.01 in each of the BVRI Bessel filters. After that, in all
BVRI filters simultaneously we observe a steepening of the power law light
curve. The power law decay index smoothly approaches the value ~= -1.9,
observed by other observatories later. This power law break occurs at t-t_0
=0.57 days and lasts for +-0.1 days. We observe no variability above the
gradual fading with the upper limits 10--1% on time scales 0.1--1000s. Spectral
flux distribution in four BVRI filters corresponds to the power law spectrum
with spectral index \alpha=0.66+-0.01. The change of the power law decay index
in the end of our observations can be interpreted as a signature of collimated
ultrarelativistic jet. The afterglow flux distribution in radio, optical and
x-rays is consistent with synchrotron spectrum. We continue our observations of
this unique object with RTT150.

using samples of BV photometry for 4' X 4' regions taken from the KPNO/CTIO
Local Group Survey (Massey et al. 2001). The distances, mean reddening values,
and age distributions of the stars in these regions were measured using the
routines of Dolphin (1997, 2002). Independent measurements of overlapping
fields show that the results are stable for most samples. A slight distance
gradient is seen across the major axis of the southern disk, and a mean
distance of 24.47+/-0.03 is found by combining the results. Higher mean
reddening values follow the spiral structure. The stellar age distributions are
consistent with episodic star formation confined mainly to the gas-rich arm
regions. If these episodes were caused by propagating density waves, the waves
did not cause significant star formation episodes in the gas-poor interarm
regions. Combination of all of the results provides the total star formation
rate for 1.4 square degrees of the M31 disk for six epochs. These results
suggest that star formation in the disk declined by ~50% from ~250 to ~50 Myr
ago. The lowest star formation rate occurred ~25 Myr ago followed by a ~20%
increase to the present. The mean star formation rate for this large portion of

the whole W3 IRS5 water maser region, they had similar position angles of the
magnetic field vectors (~75 deg from the north). The magnetic field vectors are
roughly perpendicular to the spatial alignments of the maser features. They are
consistent with the hourglass model of the magnetic field, which was previously

most interesting aspect of this problem resides in the interplay between spin
Kondo physics stemming from the screening of the spin of the small dot and
orbital Kondo physics emerging when charging states of the grain with (charge)
Q=0 and Q=e are almost degenerate. Combining Wilson's numerical
renormalization-group method with perturbative scaling approaches we push
forward our previous work [K. Le Hur and P. Simon, Phys. Rev. B 67, 201308R

strong entanglement of charge and spin flip events in this setup inevitably
results in a non trivial stable SU(4) Kondo fixed point near the degeneracy
points of the grain. By analogy with a small dot sandwiched between two leads,
the ground state is Fermi-liquid like which considerably smears out the Coulomb

Most notably, the associated Kondo temperature $T_K^{SU(4)}$ might be raised
compared to that in the conductance experiments through a small quantum dot
$(\sim 1K)$ which makes the observation of our predictions a priori accessible.
We discuss the robustness of the SU(4) correlated state against the inclusion
of an external magnetic field, a deviation from the degeneracy points,
particle-hole symmetry in the small dot, asymmetric tunnel junctions and
comment on the different crossovers.

Feshbach resonance is unshifted. By sweeping across the resonance, a thermal

Throughout this process, the interaction energy is negative and continuous. We
also show that this behavior must persist at lower temperatures unless there is
a phase transition as the temperature is lowered. We rigorously demonstrate

Connection between the pumping characteristics and associated mechanisms is

a single pair (N=1) of finger gates (FG's), the pumping mechanism is due to the
coherent inelastic scattering of the traversing electron to its subband
threshold. For a pair of FGA with pair number $N>2$, the dominant pumping
mechanism becomes that of the time-dependent Bragg reflection. The contribution
of the time-dependent Bragg reflection to the pumping is enabled by breaking
the symmetry in the electron transmission when the pumping potential is of a
predominant propagating type. This propagating wave condition can be achieved
both by an appropriate choice of the FGA pair configuration and by the
monitoring of a phase difference $\phi $ between the ac biases in the FGA pair.
The robustness of such a pumping mechanism is demonstrated by considering a FGA

function of temperature using the thermodynamic expressions resulting for the

that carry fermionic degrees of freedom on their boundaries. The number of
fermionic degrees of freedom must be sixteen; this condition arises naturally
in the framework of the matrix model. We can also prove the exact E_8 symmetry
of the spectrum around the membrane vacua at infinite mu, which arises as a
current algebra at level one just as in the heterotic string. We also find the
full E_8 gauge multiplet as well as the multiple-gluon states, carried by
collections of hemispherical membranes. Finally we discuss the dual description
of the hemispherical membranes in terms of spherical fivebranes immersed in the
domain wall; we identify the correct vacuum of the matrix model and make some
preliminary comparisons with the (1,0) superconformal field theory.

demonstrate that the plane-wave matrix theory arises through a consistent

the dilatation operator of the conformal field theory and the hamiltonian of

$\Gamma_0(N)$ of weight $k$ ($k\ge2$ even) has been known for several decades.
More recent but still well-known is the Atkin-Lehner decomposition of this
space of cusp forms into subspaces corresponding to newforms on $\Gamma_0(d)$
of weight $k$, as $d$ runs over the divisors of $N$. A recursive algorithm for
computing the dimensions of these spaces of newforms follows from the
combination of these two results, but it would be desirable to have a formula
in closed form for these dimensions. In this paper we establish such a
closed-form formula, not only for these dimensions, but also for the
corresponding dimensions of spaces of newforms on $\Gamma_1(N)$ of weight $k$
($k\ge2$). This formula is much more amenable to analysis and to computation.
For example, we derive asymptotically sharp upper and lower bounds for these
dimensions, and we compute their average orders; even for the dimensions of
spaces of cusp forms, these results are new. We also establish sharp
inequalities for the special case of weight-2 newforms on $\Gamma_0(N)$, and we
report on extensive computations of these dimensions: we find the complete list
of all $N$ such that the dimension of the space of weight-2 newforms on
$\Gamma_0(N)$ is less than or equal to 100 (previous such results had only gone
up to dimension 3).

search, but is not directly applicable to searching a physical database.
Nevertheless, Aaronson and Ambainis showed that a database of N items laid out
in d spatial dimensions can be searched in time of order sqrt(N) for d>2, and
in time of order sqrt(N) poly(log N) for d=2. We consider an alternative search
algorithm based on a continuous time quantum walk on a graph. The case of the
complete graph gives the continuous time search algorithm of Farhi and Gutmann,
and other previously known results can be used to show that sqrt(N) speedup can
also be achieved on the hypercube. We show that full sqrt(N) speedup can be
achieved on a d-dimensional periodic lattice for d>4. In d=4, the quantum walk
search algorithm takes time of order sqrt(N) poly(log N), and in d<4, the
algorithm does not provide substantial speedup.

between nuclear spins of spin-carrying molecules of a gas in a closed
nano-cavities are independent of the spacing between all spins. We derive exact
time-dependent polarization for all spins in spin-1/2 ensemble with spatially
independent effective dipolar interactions. If the initial polarization is on a
single (first) spin,$P_1(0)= 1$ then the exact spin dynamics of the model is
shown to exhibit a periodical short pulses of the polarization of the first
spin, the effect being typical of the systems having a large number, $N$, of
spins. If $N \gg 1$, then within the period $4\pi/g$ ($2\pi/g$) for odd (even)
$N$-spin clusters, with $g$ standing for spin coupling, the polarization of
spin 1 switches quickly from unity to the time independent value, 1/3, over the
time interval about $(g\sqrt{N})^{-1}$, thus, almost all the time, the spin 1
spends in the time independent condition $P_1(t)= 1/3$. The period and the
width of the pulses determine the volume and the form-factor of the ellipsoidal
cavity. The formalism is adopted to the case of time varying nano-fluctuations
of the volume of the cavitation nano-bubbles. If the volume $V(t)$ is varied by
the Gaussian-in-time random noise then the envelope of the polarization peaks
goes irreversibly to 1/3. The polarization dynamics of the single spin exhibits
the Gaussian (or exponential) time dependence when the correlation time of the
fluctuations of the nano-volume is larger (or smaller) than the $<(\delta g)^2
>^{-1/2} $, where the $<(\delta g)^2>$ is the variance of the $g(V(t))$
coupling. Finally, we report the exact calculations of the NMR line shape for
the $N$-spin gaseous aggregate.

consist of qubits arranged in a cellular array. In the quantum circuit model of
quantum computation, an often complex series of two-qubit gate operations is
required between arbitrarily distant pairs of lattice qubits. An alternative
model of quantum computation based on quantum cellular automata (QCA) requires
only homogeneous local interactions that can be implemented in parallel. This
would be a huge simplification in an actual experiment. We find some minimal
physical requirements for the construction of unitary QCA in a 1 dimensional
Ising spin chain and demonstrate optimal pulse sequences for information
transport and entanglement distribution. We also introduce the theory of
non-unitary QCA and show by example that non-unitary rules can generate
environment assisted entanglement.

which characterizes its intrinsic ability to extract which-way information in
an asymmetric two-way interferometer. The ""quality"" Q allows one to separate
the contribution to the distinguishability of the ways arising from the quantum
properties of the detector from the contribution stemming from a-priori
which-way knowledge available to the experimenter, which can be quantified by a
predictability parameter P. We provide an inequality relating these two sources
of which-way information to the value of the fringe visibility displayed by the
interferometer. We show that this inequality is an expression of duality,
allowing one to trace the loss of coherence to the two reservoirs of which-way
information represented by Q and P. Finally, we illustrate the formalism with
the use of a quantum logic gate: the Symmetric Quanton-Detecton System (SQDS).
The SQDS can be regarded as two qubits trying to acquire which way information
about each other. The SQDS will provide an illustrating example of the
reciprocal effects induced by duality between system and which-way detector.

for quantum systems, but their properties differ somewhat from those of their
classical counterparts; specifically, some equalities and inequalities of
classical information theory are in general violated.
  In this paper the concepts are generalized to include arbitrary indirect
measurements (POVMs). Though the generalization is straightforward, it is
important to ascertain that the basic relationships between the generalized
quantitites remain the same for the POVMs as for direct measurements.

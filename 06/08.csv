Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect (SZE) is studied in various cosmological models
including flat and open homogeneous (CDM) models and an inhomogeneous model
with a large-scale local void. The Press-Schechter formalism is used to derive
the abundance at epochs 0 < z < 2 and the cluster mass limit Mlim is given from
a flux limit for SZE. It is shown that SZE is useful for constraining the
cosmological model parameters, and the abundance in the inhomogeneous model may
be comparable with that in the low-density homogeneous models. The significance
of relative difference of abundances in the various models is discussed.

obtained in 2003 May using the Subaru 8.2 m telescope are presented. The
properties of the SN are investigated through a comparison with spectra of the
Type Ic hypernovae SNe 1997ef and 1998bw. (Hypernovae being a tentatively
defined class of SNe with very broad absorption features: these features
suggest a large velocity of the ejected material and possibly a large explosion
kinetic energy.) Comparison with spectra of other hypernovae shows that the
spectrum of SN 2003dh obtained on 2003 May 8 and 9, i.e., 34-35 rest-frame days
after the GRB (for z=0.1685), are similar to those of SN 1997ef obtained ~34-42
days after the fiducial time of explosion of that SN. The match with SN 1998bw
spectra is not as good (at rest 7300-8000 A, but again spectra obtained ~33-43
days after GRB 980425 are preferred. This indicates that the SN may have
intermediate properties between SNe 1997ef and 1998bw. Based on the analogy
with the other hypernovae, the time of explosion of SN 2003dh is then
constrained to be between -8 and +2 days of the GRB. The Si and O P-Cygni lines
of SN 2003dh seem comparable to those of SN 1997ef, which suggests that the
ejected mass in SN 2003dh may match that in SN 1997ef. Polarization was
marginally detected at optical wavelengths. This is consistent with
measurements of the late afterglow, implying that it mostly originated in the
interstellar medium of the host galaxy.

source/drain is attached to an intrinsic carbon nanotube channel. Ambipolar
conduction is found to be an important factor that must be carefully considered
in device design, especially when the gate oxide is thin. The channel length
scaling limit imposed by source-drain tunneling is found to be between 5nm and
10nm, depending on the off-current specification. Using a large diameter tube
increases the on-current, but it also increases the leakage current. Our study
of gate dielectric scaling shows that the charge on the nanotube can play an
important role above threshold.

It is based on the Davis-Putnam method and deals with propositional formulas
that are initially converted to negational normal form. This procedure splits
variables but, in contrast to other decision procedures based on the
Davis-Putnam method, it does not branch. Instead, this procedure iteratively
makes validity-preserving transformations of fragments of the formula. The
transformations involve only a minimal formula part containing occurrences of
the selected variable. Selection of the best variable for splitting is crucial
in this decision procedure - it may shorten the decision process dramatically.
A variable whose splitting leads to a minimal size of the transformed formula
is selected. Also, the decision procedure performs plenty of optimizations
based on calculation of delta-sets. Some optimizations lead to removing
fragments of the formula. Others detect variables for which a single truth
value assignment is sufficient. The latest information about this research can

performance is measured in terms of convergence of posteriors or losses.
Despite this closeness to M, it is difficult to assess the prediction quality

the important quantities for prediction. We show that for deterministic
computable environments, the ""posterior"" and losses of m converge, but rapid
convergence could only be shown on-sequence; the off-sequence behavior is
unclear. In probabilistic environments, neither the posterior nor the losses

Supersymmetric black holes appear to evade this inconsistency by having moduli

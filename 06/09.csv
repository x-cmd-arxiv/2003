called ``clumps,'' in dense, star-forming molecular clouds. These clumps are
believed to be the eventual sites of star formation. We study the
three-dimensional analogs of clumps using a set of self-consistent,
time-dependent numerical models of molecular clouds. The models follow the
decay of initially supersonic turbulence in an isothermal, self-gravitating,
magnetized fluid. We find the following. (1) Clumps are intrinsically triaxial.
This explains the observed deficit of clumps with a projected axis ratio near
unity, and the apparent prolateness of clumps. (2) Simulated clump axes are not
strongly aligned with the mean magnetic field within clumps, nor with the
large-scale mean fields. This is in agreement with observations. (3) The clump
mass spectrum has a high-mass slope that is consistent with the Salpeter value.
There is a low-mass break in the slope at $\sim 0.5 \msun$, although this may
depend on model parameters including numerical resolution. (4) The typical
specific spin angular momentum of clumps is $4 \times 10^{22} {\rm cm^2
s^{-1}}$. This is larger than the median specific angular momentum of binary
stars. Scaling arguments suggest that higher resolution simulations may soon be
able to resolve the scales at which the angular momentum of binary stars is
determined.

significant deviations from a simple concentric elliptical isophotal model near
the center. Regions of excess emission appear to surround two lobe-like
radio-emitting regions. This structure probably indicates that hot X-ray gas
and radio lobes are interacting. From an analysis of the X-ray spectra in
annuli, we found clear evidence for a temperature decrease and abundance
increase toward the center. The X-ray spectrum of the central region is
consistent with a single-temperature thermal plasma model. The contribution of
X-ray emission from a multiphase cooling flow component with gas cooling to
very low temperatures locally is limited to less than 10% of the total
emission. However, the whole cluster spectrum indicates that the ICM is cooling
significantly as a whole, but in only a limited temperature range ($\geq 2$
keV). Inside the cooling radius, the conduction timescales based on the Spitzer
conductivity are shorter than the cooling timescales. We detect an X-ray point
source in the cluster center which is coincident with the optical nucleus of
the central cD galaxy and the core of the associated radio source. The X-ray
spectrum of the central point source can be fit by a 1.3 keV thermal plasma and
a power-law component whose photon index is 1.9. The thermal component is
probably plasma associated with the cD galaxy. We attribute the power-law

(also supported by differential abundances relative to similar stars in NGC6822

what is expected from the nebulae though, where two independent spectroscopic
analyses of the HII regions in WLM yield [O/H] = -0.89. Intriguingly, the
oxygen abundance determined from the OI 6158 feature in one WLM star is [O/H] =

stellar and nebular oxygen abundances has been found, and presently, there is
no simple explanation for this difference. If the stellar abundances reflect
the true composition of WLM, then this galaxy lies well above the
metallicity-luminosity relationship for dwarf irregular galaxies. It also
suggests that WLM is more chemically evolved than currently interpreted from

consider the SFR obtained from Gamma-Ray Burst observations, which increases
dramatically with redshift beyond z ~ 1 in contrast to most estimates which
saturate or show a mild increase with redshift. Gamma-ray bursts may be the
most powerful tracers of star formation in the early universe and thus provide
signposts of the initial epoch of element synthesis. The star formation rate
implied by GRB statistics results in a gamma-ray background that matches the
observations more closely than that inferred from other tracers of star
formation. This may provide some support for the GRB/SFR-paradigm, which in
turn promises a powerful diagnostic of star formation, and thus cosmic chemical
evolution, from the era of Population III stars to the present.

assuming pixel-to-pixel independence. Results show these tests behave similarly

high-surface-brightness H II regions. The mean (V-I) colour of the LSB

Four techniques based on the equivalent widths of the hydrogen emission and
absorption lines, the spectral energy distribution and the colours of the
galaxy are used to put constraints on the age of the stellar population in the
low-surface-brightness (LSB) component of the galaxy, assuming two limiting
cases of star formation (SF), the case of an instantaneous burst and that of a
continuous SF with a constant or a variable star formation rate (SFR). The
spectroscopic and photometric data for different regions of the LSB component
are well reproduced by a young stellar population with an age t<250 Myr,
assuming a small extinction in the range A(V)= 0-0.6 mag. Assuming no
extinction, we find that the upper limit for the mass of the old stellar
population, formed between 2.5 Gyr and 10 Gyr, is not greater than ~(1/20 - 1)
of that of the stellar population formed during the last ~250 Myr. Depending on
the region considered, this also implies that the SFR in the most recent SF
period must be 20 to 1000 times greater than the SFR at ages > 2.5 Gyr. We
compare the photometric and spectroscopic properties of SBS 1415+437 with those
of a sample of 26 low-metallicity dwarf irregular and BCD galaxies. We show
that there is a clear trend for the stellar LSB component of lower-metallicity
galaxies to be bluer. This trend cannot be explained only by metallicity
effects. There must be also a change in the age of the stellar populations.

nematic phase. The nematic phase breaks spin rotational symmetry, but preserves
time reversal symmetry, and has gapless spin-wave excitations. The spin singlet

as secondary order parameter. Octupolar order is to some extent assisted, but
in its basic nature unchanged, by allowing for the presence of quadrupolar

hold antiferro-octupolar ordering on the fcc lattice. In this sense, the choice
of our model is motivated by the recent suggestion of octupolar ordering in
NpO2.
  The bulk of our paper is devoted to a study of the effect of an external
magnetic field on ferro-octupolar ordering. We found that octupolar order
survives up to a critical magnetic field if the field is lying in specific
directions, while for general field directions, the underlying symmetry of the
model is destroyed and therefore the phase transition suppressed even in weak
fields. Field-induced multipoles and field-induced couplings between various

the Helmholtz potential. We also studied the effect of octupolar ordering on
the non-linear magnetic susceptibility which satisfies Ehrenfest-type relations
at continuous octupolar transitions.

Schwinger-Dyson (SD) method in the improved ladder approximation. We construct
the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) effective potentials at finite temperature
for two types of pairing ansatz, namely the Color-Flavor locking (CFL) state
and the two flavor superconducting (2SC) state. Strong coupling effects at low
densities, such as the off-Fermi surface and antiquarks contribution to the
pairing gap due to the large effective coupling, make the gap, critical
temperature and those ratio deviate from those weak coupling values.
Nevertheless, the ratio of the physical quantity for the CFL and that for the
2SC does not differ so much from the weak coupling value, as long as the
pairing interaction is taken to be the same for the both cases. As a
consequence, the CFL state always dominates over 2SC state and the critical
temperatures to quark-gluon plasma (QGP) from both states coincides in the
chiral limit. The energy gain in the CFL state relative to the 2SC state gets
smaller towards the critical line dividing (mu, T) plane into the QGP and CFL
phases, and thus small perturbations can remove the degeneracy of these
critical lines. As one of such perturbations, the effect of the strange quark
mass m_s on the quark-pairing is examined. In particular, using a simple
kinematical criterion, we discuss the behaviour of the ``color-flavor unlocking

quantitative cosmology since it is the framework which provides the link
between the models of the very early Universe such as the inflationary Universe
scenario (which yield causal mechanisms for the generation of fluctuations) and
the wealth of recent high-precision observational data. In these lectures, I
provide an overview of the classical and quantum theory of cosmological
fluctuations. Crucial points in both the current inflationary paradigm of the
early Universe and in some proposed alternatives are that, first, the
perturbations are generated on microscopic scales as quantum vacuum
fluctuations, and, second, that via an accelerated expansion of the background
geometry (or by a contraction of the background), the wavelengths of the
fluctuations become much larger than the Hubble radius for a long period of
cosmic evolution. Hence, both Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity are
required in order to understand the generation and evolution of fluctuations.
  After a review of the Newtonian theory of perturbations, I discuss first the
classical relativistic theory of fluctuations, and then their quantization.
Briefly summarized are two new applications of the theory of cosmological
fluctuations: the trans-Planckian ``problem'' of inflationary cosmology and the
study of the back-reaction of cosmological fluctuations on the background
space-time geometry.

by a fan in N, the choice consists of giving an inner product or a complete
flag for M_Q=Hom(N,Q), or more generally giving for each cone sigma in the fan
a linear subspace of M_Q complementary to the subspace of M_Q perpendicular to
sigma, satisfying certain compatibility conditions.
  We show that these intersection cycles have properties analogous to the usual
intersections modulo rational equivalence. If X is simplicial (for instance, if
X is non-singular), we obtain a commutative ring structure on the invariant
cycles of X with rational coefficients. This ring structure determines cycles
representing certain characteristic classes of the toric variety. We also

molecular motor, such as the rotation velocity and the proton translocation
rate, on the chemical reaction rate using the model based only on diffusion
process. A peculiar behavior of proton translocation is found and the energy
transduction efficiency of the motor protein is enhanced by this behavior. We
give a natural explanation that this behavior is universal when certain
inequalities between chemical reaction rates hold. That may give a clue to
examine whether the motion of the molecular motor is dominated by diffusion
process or not.

desirable to find a means to reduce the phase-space of the beams. The
transverse cooling of positrons imposed by the quantum excitation-free

achieving ultra-cold beams. An analysis of the problem is presented, including
an evaluation of the contribution from multiple scattering during the passage.
The analysis shows that an emittance reduction may be achieved in special
cases, but in general the emittance will increase as a result of the multiple
scattering.

on 1D and 2D ground based profiler meas-urements. These cloud fields share
desired statistical properties with real cloud fields. As they, however, are
similar but not the same as real clouds, we call them surrogate clouds. One
important advantage of the new methods is that the amplitude distribution of
cloud liquid water is also exactly determined by the measurement: The surrogate
clouds made with the classi-cal methods such as the Fourier method and the
Bounded Cascade method are Gaussian and 'log-normal-like', respectively. Our
first new method iteratively creates a time series with a measured amplitude
distribution and power spectrum. Our sec-ond method uses an evolutionary search
algorithm to generate cloud fields with practically arbitrary constraints.
These clouds will be used to study the relation between radiation and cloud
structure.

not possible. The combination of lidar and radar can give a reliable cloud
boundary estimate in a much broader range of cases. However, also this
combination with standard methods still can not measure the cloud boundaries in
all cases. This will be illustrated with data from the Clouds and Radiation
measurement campaigns, CLARA. Rain is a problem: the radar has problems to
measure the small cloud droplets in the presence of raindrops. Similarly, few
large particles below cloud base can obscure the cloud base in radar
measurements. And the radar reflectivity can be very low at the cloud base of
water clouds or in large regions of ice clouds, due to small particles.
Multiple cloud layers and clouds with specular reflections can pose problems
for lidar. More advanced measurement techniques are suggested to solve these
problems. An angle scanning lidar can, for example, detect specular
reflections, while using information from the radars Doppler velocity spectrum
may help to detect clouds during rain.

can be thought of as degenerate Poisson brackets with a maximal set of Casimirs

degenerate Poisson brackets are brought to the form of Heisenberg's equations.
We propose a definition for constructing quantum operators for classical
functions which enables us to turn the maximally degenerate Poisson brackets
into operators. They pose a set of eigenvalue problems for a new state vector.
The requirement of the single valuedness of this eigenfunction leads to
quantization. The example of the harmonic oscillator is used to illustrate this
general procedure for quantizing a class of maximally super-integrable systems.

compared for three classes of initial states for the bath modes - grand
canonical ensemble, number states and coherent states. It is shown that for a
wide class of number states the behavior of the oscillator is similar to the
case of the equilibrium bath. If the bath modes are initially in coherent
states, then the variances of the oscillator coordinate and momentum, as well
as its entanglement to the bath, asymptotically approach the same values as for
the oscillator at zero temperature and the average coordinate and momentum show
a Brownian-like behavior. We derive an exact master equation for the
characteristic function of the oscillator valid for arbitrary factorized
initial conditions. In the case of the equilibrium bath this equation reduces
to an equation of the Hu-Paz-Zhang type, while for the coherent states bath it
leads to an exact stochastic master equation with a multiplicative noise.

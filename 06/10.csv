always of secondary importance in thin radiative disks, but cannot be neglected
in nonradiative flows, in which it completes the mean field description of
turbulence. It is, nevertheless, generally ignored in accretion flow theory,
with the exception of models explicitly driven by thermal convection, where it
is modeled phenomenologically. This flux embodies both turbulent thermal
convection as well as wave transport, and its presence is essential for a
proper formulation of energy conservation, whether convection is present or
not. The sign of the thermal flux is likely to be outward in real systems, but
the restrictive assumptions used in numerical simulations may lead to inward
thermal transport, in which case qualitatively new effects may be exhibited. We
find, for example, that a static solution would require inward, not outward,

unlikely to stifle accretion, but would simply add to the outward rotational

effect from the clusters. Most interestingly, the signal may extend to ~1 deg
around both groups and clusters and we suggest that this may be due to hot
`supercluster' gas. We have further cross-correlated the WMAP data with
clusters identified in the 2MASS galaxy catalogue and also find evidence for
temperature decrements there. From the APM group data we estimate the mean
Compton parameter as y(z<0.2)=7x10^(-7). We have further estimated the gas mass
associated with the galaxy group and cluster haloes. Assuming temperatures of 5
keV for ACO clusters and 1 keV for APM groups and clusters, we derive average
gas masses. Using the space density of APM groups we then estimate Omega_gas.
For an SZ extent of theta_max=20', kT=1 keV and h=0.7, this value of
Omega_gas=0.04 is consistent with the standard value of Omega_baryon=0.044 but
if the indications we have found for a more extended SZ effect out to theta=60'
are confirmed, then higher values of Omega_gas will be implied. Finally, the
contribution to the WMAP temperature power spectrum from the extended SZ effect
around the z<0.2 APM+ACO groups and clusters is 1-2 orders of magnitude lower
than the l=220 first acoustic peak. But if a similar SZ effect arises from more
distant clusters then this contribution could increase by a factor >10 and then

greater than the Eddington rate, it is likely to do so in an ""adiabatic"" or
radiatively inefficient manner. Under fluid (as opposed to MHD) conditions, the
disk should become convective and evolve toward a state of marginal
instability. The resulting disk structure is ""gyrentropic,"" with convection
proceeding along common surfaces of constant angular momentum, Bernoulli
function and entropy, called ""gyrentropes."" We present a family of
two-dimensional, self-similar models which describes the time-averaged disk
structure. We then suppose that there is a self-similar, Newtonian torque and
that the Prandtl number is large. This torque drives inflow and meridional
circulation and the resulting flow is computed. Convective transport will
become ineffectual near the disk surface. It is conjectured that this will lead
to a large increase of entropy across a ""thermal front"" which we identify as
the effective disk surface and the base of an outflow. The conservation of
mass, momentum and energy across this thermal front permits a matching of the
disk models to self-similar outflow solutions. We then demonstrate that
self-similar disk solutions can be matched smoothly onto relativistic flows at
small radius and thin disks at large radius. This model of adiabatic accretion
is contrasted with some alternative models that have been discussed recently.
The disk models developed in this paper should be useful for interpreting
numerical, fluid dynamical simulations. Related principles to those described
here may govern the behaviour of astrophysically relevant, magnetohydrodynamic
disk models.

stellar evolution. They are now becoming directly observable through X-ray
astronomy, owing to their high surface temperatures. In particular, features in
their X-ray spectra could reveal the presence of atmospheres, or gauge their
unknown magnetic fields through the cyclotron process, as in the classic case
of X-ray binaries. All isolated neutron stars spectra observed so far, however,
appear as featureless thermal continua. The unique exception is 1E 1207.4-5209.
In its spectrum, previous observations had detected two deep absorption
features, still too undefined for any unambiguous interpretation. Here we
report on a much longer X-ray observation, in which the star's spectrum shows
three distinct features, regularly spaced at 0.7, 1.4 and 2.1 keV, plus a
fourth, lower significance one, at 2.8 keV. Such features vary in phase with
the star rotation. Cyclotron resonant absorption is their logical
interpretation, yielding a magnetic field strenght of 8x10^10 Gauss in the case
of electrons. This is the first direct measure of an isolated neutron star
magnetic field.

using photometric cuts made parallel to the major and the minor axes for each

as objects of lowest surface brightness in the Revised Flat Galaxies Catalog
have LSB (low surface brightness) disks. Stellar disks of our LSB galaxies are
thinner than HSB (high surface brightness) ones. There is a good correlation
between the central surface brightness of the stellar disk and its ratio of
vertical to radial scales. The ratio of the disk photometric scales enables us
to estimate the mass of the spherical galactic subsystem using results from
numerical modeling. Combining our results with published rotation curves we
determined the mass of dark halos for the galaxies in our sample. The LSB
galaxies tend to harbor relatively more massive spherical subsystems than those
of HSB's. Indeed, we found no systematic difference between our LSB and HSB
objects in dark halo masses considering it separately from the bulge. At the
same time, the inferred mass/luminosity ratio for the LSB disks appears to be
systematically higher, when compared to the ratio for HSB ones.

the nature of the dust in low metallicity environments. The detailed modeling
is performed in a self-consistent way, synthesizing the global ISRF of the
galaxy using an evolutionary synthesis model with further constraints provided
by the observed MIR ionic lines and a photoionisation model. Our results show
that the dust properties are different in this low metallicity galaxy compared
to other more metal rich galaxies. The results indicate a paucity of PAHs
probably due to the destructive effects of the ISRF penetrating a clumpy
environment and a size-segregation of grains where the emission is dominated by
small grains of size ~3 nm, consistent with the idea of shocks having a
dramatic effect on the dust properties in NGC 1569. A significant millimetre
excess is present in the dust SED which can be explained by the presence of
ubiquitous very cold dust (T = 5-7 K). This dust component accounts for 40 to
70 % of the total dust mass in the galaxy (1.6 - 3.4 10^5 Msol) and could be
distributed in small clumps (size a few pc) throughout the galaxy. We find a
gas-to-dust mass ratio of 740 - 1600, larger than that of the Galaxy and a
dust-to-metals ratio of 1/4 to 1/7. We generate an extinction curve for NGC
1569, consistent with the modeled dust size distribution. This extinction curve
has relatively steep FUV rise and smaller 2175 Angstroms bump, resembling the

string-based brane-world scenarios. The idea is to start from a supersymmetric
configuration with two parallel static Dp-branes, and slightly break the
supersymmetry conditions to produce a very flat potential for the field that
parametrises the distance between the branes, i.e. the inflaton field. This
breaking can be achieved in various ways. I will describe one of the simplest
examples described in Ref. [1]: two almost parallel D4-branes in a flat
compactified space, with a small relative angle between the branes, softly
breaking supersymmetry. If the breaking parameter is sufficiently small, a
large number of e-folds can be produced within the D-brane, for small changes
of the configuration in the compactified directions. Such a process is local,
i.e. it does not depend very strongly on the compactification space nor on the
initial conditions. Moreover, the breaking induces a very small velocity and
acceleration, which ensures very small slow-roll parameters and thus an almost
scale invariant spectrum of metric fluctuations, responsible for the observed
temperature and polarization anisotropies in the microwave background. Another
prediction of the model is the small amplitude of the gravitational wave
spectrum, which may not be detectable in the near future. Inflation ends as in
hybrid inflation, triggered by the negative curvature of the string tachyon
potential.

of occurrence of galactic nova outbursts which involve an oxygen-neon (ONe)
white dwarf. The improvement with respect to previous work on the subject
derives from the fact that we use the results that our evolutionary
calculations provide for the final mass and for the chemical profiles of
intermediate-to-massive primary components of close binary systems. In
particular, the final evolutionary stages, such as the carbon burning phase,
have been carefully followed for the whole range of masses of interest. The
chemical profiles obtained with our evolutionary code are of interest in
determining the chemical composition of the ejecta after being processed
through the thermonuclear runaway, although such other factors as the
efficiency of the mixing between the accreted material and that of the
underlying white dwarf must also be considered. In our calculations of the
frequency of occurrence of nova outbursts involving an ONe white dwarf, we also
take into account the observational selection effects introduced by the
different recurrence times of the outbursts and by the spatial distribution of
novae. In spite of the very different evolutionary sequences, we find that
approximately 1/3 of the novae observed in outburst should involve an
oxygen-neon white dwarf, in agreement with previous theoretical estimates.

evolution of the simulated models is followed over 10--20 rotation periods of

constancy of $Q_T \simeq 1.2 -- 1.5$ for $r\simeq (1\div 2)\times L$ (where L
is the radial scale of disk surface density), valid for a wide range of models,

of the `parent' halo in which they are located. We find that the substructure
mass function depends at most weakly on the mass of the parent halo and is well
described by a power-law. The radial number density profiles of substructures
are steeper in low mass halos than in high mass halos. More massive
substructures tend to avoid the centres of halos and are preferentially located

It is found that although RMT gives a qualitative explanation of the numerical

master sequences. As $ \eps_r $ exceeds the fraction of deleterious mutations,
the population undergoes a ``repair'' catastrophe, in which the equilibrium
distribution is still localized about the viability master sequence, but is
spread ergodically over the sequence subspace defined by the repair gene. Below
the repair catastrophe, the distribution undergoes the error catastrophe when $

distribution undergoes the error catastrophe when $ \mu $ exceeds $ \ln

E 68, 041302 (2003)","10.1103/PhysRevE.68.041302",,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft",,"  The shear viscosity for a moderately dense granular binary mixture of smooth
hard spheres undergoing uniform shear flow is determined. The basis for the
analysis is the Enskog kinetic equation, solved first analytically by the
Chapman-Enskog method up to first order in the shear rate for unforced systems
as well as for systems driven by a Gaussian thermostat. As in the elastic case,
practical evaluation requires a Sonine polynomial approximation. In the leading
order, we determine the shear viscosity in terms of the control parameters of
the problem: solid fraction, composition, mass ratio, size ratio and
restitution coefficients. Both kinetic and collisional transfer contributions
to the shear viscosity are considered. To probe the accuracy of the
Chapman-Enskog results, the Enskog equation is then numerically solved for
systems driven by a Gaussian thermostat by means of an extension to dense gases
of the well-known Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for dilute gases.
The comparison between theory and simulation shows in general an excellent
agreement over a wide region of the parameter space.

oscillations of the thermal cloud and the condensate. The in- and counter-phase
oscillations are independent of each other in the case where the thermal cloud
is inviscid for all modes studied, except the radial pulsations which couple
them because the pressure perturbations of the condensate and the thermal cloud
are governed by different adiabatic indices. If the thermal cloud is viscous,
the two classes of oscillations are coupled, i.e. each type of motion involves
simultaneously mass and entropy currents. The counter-phase oscillations are
damped by the mutual friction between the condensate and the thermal cloud
mediated by the vortex lattice. The damping is large for the values of the
drag-to-lift ratio of the order of unity and becomes increasingly ineffective
in either limit of small or large friction. An experimental measurement of a
subset of these oscillation modes and their damping rates can provide
information on the values of the phenomenological mutual friction coefficients,

While it is well known that the full logic has no finite axiomatisation, a more
detailed analysis of fragments of the logic was not previously available.
However, a breakthrough by Hodkinson et.al., identifying a finitely
axiomatisable fragment, termed the monodic fragment, has led to improved
understanding of FOTL. Yet, in order to utilise these theoretical advances, it
is important to have appropriate proof techniques for the monodic fragment.
  In this paper, we modify and extend the clausal temporal resolution
technique, originally developed for propositional temporal logics, to enable
its use in such monodic fragments. We develop a specific normal form for
formulae in FOTL, and provide a complete resolution calculus for formulae in
this form. Not only is this clausal resolution technique useful as a practical
proof technique for certain monodic classes, but the use of this approach
provides us with increased understanding of the monodic fragment. In
particular, we here show how several features of monodic FOTL are established
as corollaries of the completeness result for the clausal temporal resolution
method. These include definitions of new decidable monodic classes,
simplification of existing monodic classes by reductions, and completeness of
clausal temporal resolution in the case of monodic logics with expanding
domains, a case with much significance in both theory and practice.

explore the manifestation of this remarkable fact on the lattice 4-torus for
SU(3) using advanced techniques for controlling lattice discretization errors,
extending earlier work of De Forcrand et. al. for SU(2). We identify three
distinct signals for the instability of |Q|=1 configurations, and show that
these manifest themselves early in the cooling process, long before the
would-be instanton has shrunk to a size comparable to the lattice
discretization threshold. These signals do not appear for our |Q|=2
configurations. This indicates that these signals reflect the truly global
nature of the instability, rather than local discretization effects.
Monte-Carlo generated SU(3) gauge field configurations are cooled to the
self-dual limit using an O(a^4)-improved gauge action chosen to have small but
positive O(a^6) errors. This choice prevents lattice discretization errors from
destroying instantons provided their size exceeds the dislocation threshold of
the cooling algorithm. Lattice discretization errors are evaluated by comparing
the O(a^4)-improved gauge-field action with an O(a^4)-improved action
constructed from the square of an O(a^4)-improved lattice field-strength
tensor, thus having different O(a^6) discretization errors. The number of
action-density peaks, the instanton size and the topological charge of
configurations is monitored. We observe a fluctuation in the total topological
charge of |Q|=1 configurations, and demonstrate that the onset of this unusual
behavior corresponds with the disappearance of multiple-peaks in the action
density. At the same time discretization errors are minimal.

F-term inflation with a particular relation between Yukawa and gauge coupling,
or a mix of these models. We show that F and D models, before coupling to

model to N=1 supergravity breaks this symmetry and introduces a class of P-term
models interpolating between D-term and F-term inflation. The difference
between these models is determined by the direction of the vector P, which
depends on the fluxes in the underlying D3/D7 model of brane inflation. We
discuss cosmological consequences of various versions of P-term inflation.

  If we replace ``group G'' by ``monoid M'', the answer is the less familiar
condition that the improper left congruence on M be finitely generated.
  Replacing our group or monoid with a small category E, the concept of set on
which G or M acts with that of a functor E --> Set, and the concept of fixed

respect to which the moduli space of symplectic structures is Lagrangian. The

emission time of light clusters depends on their masses. For clusters with the

energy spectrum of light clusters are sensitive to the density dependence of
nuclear symmetry energy, with more light clusters produced in the case of a
stiff symmetry energy. On the other hand, effects due to the stiffness of the
isoscalar part of nuclear equation of state and the medium dependence of
nucleon-nucleon cross sections on light cluster production are unimportant. We
have also studied the correlation functions of clusters, and they are affected
by the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy as well, with the stiff
symmetry energy giving a stronger anti-correlation of light clusters,
particularly for those with large kinetic energies. Dependence of light cluster
production on the centrality and incident energy of heavy ion collisions as

Bonn potential. Instead of relying on the Pomeron-$f$ proportionality
assumption, the $f_2$ meson exchange amplitude is established from an effective
Lagrangian which is constructed from the tensor structure of the $f_2$ meson.
Phenomenological information together with tensor meson dominance and vector
meson dominance assumptions are used to estimate the $f_2$ coupling constants.
As a first step to improve the current theoretical models, we have also
explored the effects due to the un-correlated $2\pi$ exchange amplitude with
$\pi N$ intermediate state. This leading-order $2\pi$ exchange amplitude can be
calculated using the coupling constants determined from the study of pion
photoproduction and the empirical width of $\rho \to \pi\pi$ decay. In
comparing with the existing differential cross section data, we find that a
model with the constructed $2\pi$, $\sigma$, and $f_2$ exchanges is comparable
to the commonly used $\sigma$ exchange model in which the $\sigma$ coupling
parameters are simply adjusted to fit the experimental data. We suggest that
experimental verifications of the predicted single and double spin asymmetries
in the small $|t|$ ($ < 2$ GeV$^2$) region will be useful for distinguishing
the two models and improving our understanding of the non-resonant amplitude of

charged matter of electron with free nuclei. Heavy nucleus, appearing inside
the area of basic localization of electron, is inevitably deformed because of
interaction of protons with the adjoining layers of electronic cloud, which may

represent an informational field capable of superluminally transmitting a
signal (information) with no energy and momentum transfer. This conclusion
strictly follows from Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic field interacting
with electric charges and currents in vacuum, without resort to any additional
hypotheses. That superluminal communication is possible is seen from the fact
that the own field, generated by particles and inseparable from them,
transforms the environment into a special physical medium which is capable to
instantaneously transfer a signal (information) about any changes, happening to
a particle in the region of its basic localization, to arbitrarily large
distances. The phenomenon of superluminal communication is caused by the
non-local connection of scalar and vector potentials with the electric and
magnetic field strengths. The basis for the mechanism of superluminal
communication considered in this work is the Aharonov-Bohm effect indicative of
the field of electromagnetic potentials as a real physical field, which
directly influences the behaviour of electron waves. The conclusion is made
that in quantum systems superluminal signals occur constantly, in any quantum
processes. The occurrence of superluminal signals is due to the space-time
symmetry breaking of a special kind, consisting in that the equations for
potentials do not possess relativistic invariance though Maxwell's equations
for the field strengths are Lorentz-invariant. The results presented do not
contradict the physical principles underlying special relativity and confirm

equation, due to a spatially dependent mass, and the ordering ambiguity. Some
examples show that, even in this case, one can find exact solutions.
Furthermore, it is demonstrated that operators with linear dependence on the
momentum are nonambiguous.

gated-mode photon detector and a plug & play system for quantum key
distribution. The visibility with 0.1 photon/pulse was more than 80% after 100
km transmission. This corresponds to the fidelity of a quantum cryptography
system of more than 90% and a QBER of less than 10%, satisfying the security
criteria.

states and, from the properties applying the secret sharing present a new type
of quantum key distribution protocols as generalization of quantum key
distribution between two persons. In the protocols each group can retrieve the
secure key string, only if all members in each group should cooperate with one
another. We also show that the protocols are secure against an external
eavesdropper using the intercept/resend strategy.

do not offer significant advantage over unitary encodings. We also propose a
practical authentication protocol based on the use of two successive unitary
encodings.

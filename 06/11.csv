of bright foreground extragalactic sources detected in CMB maps are Blazars. In
this paper we calculate the contamination of CMB anisotropy maps by this type
of flat-spectrum, strongly variable and polarized extragalactic radio sources
using up-to-date results from recent deep multi-frequency surveys. We found
that more than 50 known Blazars (or Blazar candidates) are included in the
90/150 GHz BOOMERANG anisotropy maps, a factor > 15 larger than previously
reported. Using a recent derivation of the Blazar radio LogN-LogS we calculate
that these sources induce an average sky brightness of 0.2 Jy/deg^2,
corresponding to an average temperature of ~3-5 muK. Moreover, we find that the
associated level of fluctuations is of the order of C_{l, Blazar}= 1.3 10^{-2}
mu K^2 sr at 41 GHz. Taking into account both Blazar variability and the many
steep-spectrum radio sources that flatten at high frequencies, as well as the
contribution of radio-galaxies, we find that the level of residual fluctuation
due to discrete extragalactic foreground sources could be factor of ~2 - 3
higher than the above estimate. We show that the Blazar induced fluctuations
contaminate the CMB spectrum at the level of ~ 20-50 % at l = 500 and 50-100 %
at l = 800. Careful cleaning for Blazar contamination of high sensitivity/high
resolution CMB maps is therefore necessary before firm conclusions about weak
features, like secondary high-l peaks of the CMB power spectrum or very weak
signals like CMB polarization measurements, can be achieved.

significantly alter the flux: a NFW distribution produces fluxes which are at

propagation parameters and dark matter distribution normalization, together
with current data on cosmic antiprotons, cannot lead to any definitive
constraint on the supersymmetric parameter space, neither in a low-energy
effective MSSM, or in a minimal SUGRA scheme. However, if the best choice for
propagation parameters - corresponding to a diffusive halo of L=4 kpc - is
adopted, some supersymmetric configurations with the neutralino mass of about
100 GeV should be considered as excluded. An enhancement flux factor - due for
instance to a clumpy dark halo or to a higher local dark matter density - would
imply a more severe cut on the supersymmetric parameters.

of these black holes as potential sites for tests of general relativity.
Accordingly, we stress phenomena that originate in strong gravity, such as
relativistic Fe emission lines and thermal continuum emission, both of which
arise in the inner accretion disk. Especially important in this regard are the
high-frequency (40-450 Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations observed for seven black
holes, three of which show evidence for commensurate (3:2) pairs of

gradients strongly correlate with the gradients of sigma, but only weakly with
the central index values and galaxy velocity dispersion. Using stellar
population models with variable element abundance ratios from Thomas, Maraston
& Bender (2003a) we derive average ages, metallicities and [alpha/Fe] ratios in
the center and at the effective radius. We find that the [alpha/Fe] ratio
correlates with velocity dispersion and drives 30% of the Mg-sigma relation,
the remaining 70% being caused by metallicity variations. We derive negative
metallicity gradients (-0.16 dex per decade) that are significantly flatter
than what is expected from gaseous monolithic collapse models, pointing to the
importance of mergers in the galaxy formation history. The gradients in age are
negligible, implying that no significant residual star formation has occurred
either in the center or in the outer parts of the galaxies, and that the
stellar populations at different radii must have formed at a common epoch. For
the first time we derive the gradients of the [alpha/Fe] ratio and find them
very small on the mean. Hence, [alpha/Fe] enhancement is not restricted to
galaxy centers but it is a global phenomenon. Our results imply that the
Mg-sigma local relation inside a galaxy, unlike the global Mg-sigma relation,
must be primarily driven by metallicity variations alone.

Esrange base near Kiruna. In addition to the 143 GHz and 217 GHz frequency
bands dedicated to CMB studies, Archeops had one 545 GHz and six 353 GHz
bolometers mounted in three polarization sensitive pairs that were used for
Galactic foreground studies. We present maps of the I, Q, U Stokes parameters
over 17% of the sky and with a 13 arcmin resolution at 353 GHz (850 microns).
They show a significant Galactic large scale polarized emission coherent on the
longitude ranges [100, 120] and [180, 200] deg. with a degree of polarization
at the level of 4-5%, in agreement with expectations from starlight
polarization measurements. Some regions in the Galactic plane (Gem OB1,
Cassiopeia) show an even stronger degree of polarization in the range 10-20%.
Those findings provide strong evidence for a powerful grain alignment mechanism
throughout the interstellar medium and a coherent magnetic field coplanar to
the Galactic plane. This magnetic field pervades even some dense clouds.
Extrapolated to high Galactic latitude, these results indicate that
interstellar dust polarized emission is the major foreground for PLANCK-HFI CMB
polarization measurement.

understood since high-critical-density emission lines can arise at such
relatively inner regions even if their ionization potentials are low. The

spectra over the outburst. The source transited from an initial Low Hard State
(LS), to an Intermediate State (IS), and then back to the LS. The source shows
an hysteresis effect similar to what is observed in other sources, favoring a
common origin for the state transitions in soft X-ray transients. The first
transition occurs at a ~ constant 2-200 keV flux, which probably indicates a
change in the relative importance of the emitting media. The second transition
is more likely driven by a drop in the mass accretion rate.
  In both LS, the spectra are characterized by the presence of a strong
power-law tail (Compton corona) with a variable high energy cut-off. During the
IS, the spectra show the presence of a ~0.8 keV thermal component (accretion
disk). We discuss the apparently independent evolution of the two media, and
show that right after the X-ray maximum on MJD 51662, the decrease of the
source luminosity is due to a decrease of the power-law luminosity, at a
constant disk luminosity. This, together with the detection of radio emission
(with a spectrum typical of optically thin synchrotron emission), may suggest
that the corona is ejected and further detected as a discrete radio ejection.

astro-ph/0107397). This question received a positive answer, subject to the
condition that the global matter distribution is necessarily fractal, D=2. The
purpose of the present paper is to show how general gravitational processes
arise in this universe. We illustrate the theory by using it to model an
idealized spiral galaxy. One particular subclass of solutions, corresponding to
logarithmic spirals, has already been extensively tested in Roscoe
A&A,1999,343,788-800 (astro-ph/0107305), and shown to resolve dynamical data
over large samples of ORCs with a very high degree of statistical precision.
However, this latter analysis led directly to the discovery of a major new
phenomenology in spiral discs - that of discrete dynamical classes -
comprehensively confirmed in Roscoe A&A,2002,385,431-453 (astro-ph/0107300)
over four large independent samples of ORCs. In this paper, we analyse the
theory to show how the discrete dynamical classes phenomenology has a ready
explanation in terms of an algebraic consistency condition which must
necessarily be satisfied. Of equal significance, we apply the theory with
complete success to the detailed modelling of a sample of eight Low Surface
Brightness spirals (LSBs) which, hitherto, have been succesfully modelled only
by Milgrom's MOND algorithm. We are able to conclude that the essence of the
MOND algorithm must be contained within the presented theory.

MOCASSIN for one of the hydrogen-deficient knots (J3) of the born-again

cold, dense, hydrogen-deficient core with very high metal abundances. The inner
core is surrounded by a less dense hydrogen-deficient and metal-enriched gas
envelope, with less extreme abundances. The envelope of the knot might have
been formed by the mixing of the knot material with the surrounding nebular
gas. This bi-chemistry, bi-density model did not produce enough heating to
match the fluxes of the collisionally excited emission lines (CELs) and of the
optical recombination lines (ORLs) observed in the spectrum of the knot. We
therefore included heating by photoelectric emission from dust grains in the
thermal equilibrium calculations, and found that dust-to-gas ratios of 0.077
and 0.107 by mass for the central core and the envelope of the knot,
respectively, are sufficient to fit the spectrum. Surprisingly, photoelectric
emission from grains is the dominant source of heating in the hot envelope of
the knot, while heating by photoionization of helium and heavy elements
dominates in the cold core. The chemical abundances inferred from our modelling
indicate, in agreement with the empirical analysis of Wesson et al. (2003),
that the C/O ratio in the two regions of the knot is less than unity, contrary
to theoretical predictions for born-again nebulae.

derivative of the resistive curves are identified as intra- and intergrain
superconducting transitions. Strong intragrain granularity effects are
observed, and explained by considering the antiphase boundaries between
structural domains of coherently rotated RuO6 octahedra as intragrain
Josephson-junctions. A different field dependence of the intragrain transition
temperature in these compounds was found. For Ru-(1212) it remains unchanged up
to 0.1 T, decreasing for higher fields. In Ru-(1222) it smoothly diminishes
with the increase in field even for a value as low as 100 Oe. These results are
interpreted as a consequence of a spin-flop transition of the Ru moments. The
large separation between the RuO2 layers in Ru-(1222) promotes a weak
interlayer coupling, leading the magnetic transition to occur at lower fields.
The suppression rate of the intragrain transition temperature is about five
times higher for Ru-(1222), a result we relate to an enhancement of the 2D
character of the vortex structure. A distinctive difference with conventional
cuprates is the sharp increase in amplitude of the intergrain peak in both
systems, as the field is raised, which is ascribed to percolation through a
fraction of high quality intergrain junctions.

free carriers are coupled to a continuous spectrum of fluctuations. Assuming
the Marginal Fermi Liquid (MFL) form as a first approximation for the
fluctuation spectrum, the doping-dependent coupling constant $\lambda (p)$ can
be estimated directly from the slope of the reflectance spectrum. We find that
$\lambda (p)$ decreases smoothly with the hole doping level, from underdoped
samples with $ p=0.103$ ($T_c = 67$ K) where $\lambda (p)= 0.93$ to overdoped
samples with $p=0.226$, ($T_c= 60$ K) where $\lambda(p)= 0.53$. An analysis of
the intercept and curvature of the reflectance spectrum shows deviations from
the MFL spectrum symmetrically placed at the optimal doping point $p=0.16$. The
Kubo formula for the conductivity gives a better fit to the experiments with
the MFL spectrum up to 2000 cm$^{-1}$ and with an additional Drude component or
an additional Lorentz component up to 7000 cm$^{-1}$. By comparing three
different model fits we conclude that the MFL channel is necessary for a good
fit to the reflectance data. Finally, we note that the monotonic variation of
the reflectance slope with doping provides us with an independent measure of

useful for clarifying the wave propagation characteristics. We give a general
proof that the immittance of EM Bloch waves on a plane in infinite one- and

clusters are fractals of dimension $d_f\approx 1.733$. The clusters generated
are anisotropic. Due to the rotational constraint, the cluster growth is
deviated from that expected due to the directional constraint. Connectivity
lengths, one along the elongation of the cluster and the other perpendicular to
it, diverge as $p\to p_c$ with different critical exponents. The clusters are
less anisotropic than the directed percolation clusters. Different moments of
the cluster size distribution $P_s(p)$ show power law behavior with $|p-p_c|$
in the critical regime with appropriate critical exponents. The values of the
critical exponents are estimated and found to be very different from those
obtained in other percolation models. The proposed DSP model thus belongs to a
new universality class. A scaling theory has been developed for the cluster
related quantities. The critical exponents satisfy the scaling relations
including the hyperscaling which is violated in directed percolation. A
reasonable data collapse is observed in favour of the assumed scaling function

the phase breaking due to the Kondo effect. Below the Kondo temperature, the
phase coherence time increases, as expected in the framework of Kondo physics.
At much lower temperatures, the phase coherence time saturates again, in
contradiction with standard Fermi liquid theory. In the same temperature
regime, the resistivity curve displays a characteristic maximum at zero

incorporate that through the frictional dynamics (stick-slip) of two surfaces
where one surface moves over the other. These models are more or less
successful to reproduce the well known Gutenberg-Richter type power law in the
(released) energy distribution of earthquakes. During sticking period, the
elastic energy gets stored at the contact area of the surfaces and is released
when a slip occurs. Therefore, the extent of the contact area between two
surfaces plays an important role in the earthquake dynamics and the power law
in energy distribution might imply a similar law for the contact area
distribution. Since, fractured surfaces are fractals and tectonic plate-
earth's crust interface can be considered to have fractal nature, we study here
the contact area distribution between two fractal surfaces. We consider the
overlap set of two self-similar fractals, characterised by the same fractal
dimensions, and look for their distribution. We have studied numerically the
specific cases of both regular and random Cantor sets in one dimension and
gaskets and percolation fractals in two dimension. We find that in all the
cases the distributions show an universal finite size scaling behavior. The
contact area distributions have got a power law decay for both regular and
random Cantor sets and also for gaskets. However, for percolation clusters the
distribution shows Gaussian variation.

conceptually: Trial self-energies from a two-site single-impurity Anderson
model are used to evaluate an exact and general variational principle. While
this restriction of the domain of the functional represents a strong
approximation, the approach is still thermodynamically consistent by
construction and represents a conceptual improvement of the ``linearized DMFT''
which has been suggested previously as a handy approach to study the critical
regime close to the transition. It turns out that the two-site approximation is
able to reproduce the complete (zero and finite-temperature) phase diagram for
the Mott transition. For the critical point at T=0, the entire calculation can
be done analytically. This calculation elucidates different general aspects of
the self-energy-functional theory. Furthermore, it is shown how to deal with a
number of technical difficulties which appear when the self-energy functional
is evaluated in practice.

based on throughput, the number of tasks that an algorithm can carry out in a

et al., which measures how quickly an algorithm can finish tasks that start at
specified times. The novel feature of the throughput measure, which
distinguishes it from the latency measure, is that it is compositional: it
supports a notion of algorithms that are competitive relative to a class of
subroutines, with the property that an algorithm that is k-competitive relative
to a class of subroutines, combined with an l-competitive member of that class,
gives a combined algorithm that is kl-competitive.

algorithms for collect operations, in which each of a group of n processes
obtains all values stored in an array of n registers. Collects are a
fundamental building block of a wide variety of shared-memory distributed

pretzel, and chaotic; the first two being regions of quasi-periodicity while
the latter is a region of chaos. By changing the relative masses of the three

changes and that this deformation can be interpreted physically in terms of the

we tie the variation of $\alpha$ to the evolution of the quintessence field
proposed by Albrecht and Skordis, and show that agreement with all these data,
as well as consistency with WMAP observations, can be achieved for a range of

function, depending on Q^2C, summarizing the effects of collinear radiation,
and a function describing soft emission at large angles, with momenta of order
QC. The former is the same as for the thrust upon scaling C by 1/6, whereas the
latter is different. We verify that the rescaled C distribution coincides with
that of 1-T to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, as predicted by Catani and

to soft radiation at large angles. The pattern of power corrections is also
similar to that of the thrust: corrections appear as odd powers of Lambda/(QC).

different: subleading power corrections for the C distribution appear to be
significantly smaller than those for the thrust.

family of massive flows that preserve eight supersymmetries in M-theory. This
family constitutes all the radially symmetric Coulomb branch flows of the

problem to the solution of a single, non-linear partial differential equation

describing relativistic scattering processes. It was developed for local
quantum field theories. However, there are field theories which are governed by
non-local interactions, for example non-commutative quantum field theory
(NCQFT). Filk (Phys. Lett. B 376 (1996) 53) first studied NCQFT perturbatively
obtaining the usual Feynman propagator and additional phase factors as the
basic elements of perturbation theory. However, this treatment is only
applicable for cases, where the deformation of space-time does not involve
time. Thus, we generalize Filk's approach in two ways: First, we study
non-local interactions of a very general type able to embed NCQFT. And second,
we also include the case, where non-locality involves time. A few applications
of the obtained formalism will also be discussed.

pointed out several references and formulated the statement that in the

self-adjoint Fredholm operators is given by the sum of the odd partial
signatures at each degeneracy instant. In the present version of the article,
this statement is part of Proposition 2.9; totally, the contribution of the

invariant for the mapping torus of a finite-order diffeomorphism of a homology

if the action has fixed points, and a version of the Boyer-Nicas (1990)
invariant if the action is free. We deduce, for finite-order mapping tori, the
conjecture of Furuta and Ohta that their invariant reduces mod 2 to the Rohlin
invariant of a manifold carrying a generator of the third homology group. Under
some transversality assumptions, we show that the Furuta-Ohta invariant
coincides with the Lefschetz number of the action on Floer homology. Comparing
our two answers yields an example of a diffeomorphism acting trivially on the

powerful technique for efficiently and elegantly describing and analyzing
quantum optics sources and detectors while respecting the photon number
superselection rule that is satisfied by all known quantum optics experiments.
We apply the entangled coherent state representation to elucidate and resolve
the longstanding puzzles of the coherence of a laser output field, interference
between two number states, and dichotomous interpretations of quantum
teleportation of coherent states.

denotational semantics for programming languages and to study the computability
of partial functions. Recently, the application of domain theory has also been
extended to the quantum setting. In this note we review these results and we
present some new thoughts in this field.

A, vol 461, pp 207--235, 2005.","10.1098/rspa.2004.1372",,"quant-ph",,"  We study and solve the problem of distilling secret key from quantum states
representing correlation between two parties (Alice and Bob) and an
eavesdropper (Eve) via one-way public discussion: we prove a coding theorem to
achieve the ""wire-tapper"" bound, the difference of the mutual information
Alice-Bob and that of Alice-Eve, for so-called cqq-correlations, via one-way
public communication.
  This result yields information--theoretic formulas for the distillable secret
key, giving ``ultimate'' key rate bounds if Eve is assumed to possess a
purification of Alice and Bob's joint state.
  Specialising our protocol somewhat and making it coherent leads us to a
protocol of entanglement distillation via one-way LOCC (local operations and
classical communication) which is asymptotically optimal: in fact we prove the
so-called ""hashing inequality"" which says that the coherent information (i.e.,
the negative conditional von Neumann entropy) is an achievable EPR rate.
  This result is well--known to imply a whole set of distillation and capacity
formulas which we briefly review.

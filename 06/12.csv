galaxies from two deep ACS GTO fields with deep optical-IR imaging. A total of
23 objects are found over 46 arcmin^2, or ~0.5 objects/arcmin^2 down to z~27.3
(6 sigma; all AB mag) (including one probable z~6 AGN). Combining deep ISAAC
data for our RDCS1252-2927 field (J~25.7 and Ks~25.0 (5 sigma)) and NICMOS data
for the HDF North (JH~27.3 (5 sigma)), we verify that these dropouts have flat
spectral slopes. i-dropouts in our sample range in luminosity from ~1.5 L*
(z~25.6) to ~0.3 L* (z~27.3) with the exception of one very bright candidate at
z~24.2. The half-light radii vary from 0.09"" to 0.29"", or 0.5 kpc to 1.7 kpc.
We derive the z~6 rest-frame UV luminosity density using three different
procedures, each utilizing simulations based on a CDF South V dropout sample.
First, we compare our findings with a no-evolution projection of this V-dropout
sample. We find 23+/-25% more i-dropouts than we predict. Adopting previous
results to z~5, this works out to a 20+/-29% drop in the luminosity density
from z~3 to z~6. Second, we use these same V-dropout simulations to derive a
selection function for our i-dropout sample and compute the UV-luminosity
density (7.2+/-2.5 x 10^25 ergs/s/Hz/Mpc^3 down to z~27). We find a 39+/-21%
drop over the same redshift range. This is our preferred value and suggests a
star formation rate of 0.0090+/-0.0031 M_sol/yr/Mpc^3 to z~27, or ~0.036+/-
0.012 M_sol/yr/Mpc^3 extrapolating the LF to the faint limit. Third, we follow
a very similar procedure, but assume no incompleteness, finding a luminosity
density which is ~2-3X lower. This final estimate constitutes a lower limit.
All three estimates are within the canonical range of luminosity densities
necessary for reionization of the universe at this epoch. (abridged)

Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051, obtained during a 6-week duration
low-flux state in 2001 February. During the Chandra observation, the 2-10 keV
source flux was 7e-12 erg/cm^2/s, corresponding to a 2-10 keV luminosity of
8e40 erg/s. We confirm the absence of strong extended soft X-ray emission in
NGC 4051, and that the low state spectrum is dominated by the central point
source. The X-ray spectrum has an unusual, hybrid shape, very soft below ~3 keV
(and which we model with a black body of temperature 0.14 keV) and very hard at
higher energies (power-law slope of Gamma~1). The lightcurves in both soft and
hard bands are significantly variable and correlated, implying a connection
between hard and soft components and proving that the hard component is
dominated by primary continuum emission and is not due to pure reflection from
distant cold material. However, a comparison with RXTE data obtained during the
same 2001 low state suggests the presence of unusually prominent disk
reflection features, which may help to explain the apparent upwards curvature
and extreme hardness of the Chandra spectrum above a few keV. The shape of the
2001 low state spectrum is consistent with that observed in a brief (<3 d) low
flux excursion during the source's normal state in April 2000, suggesting that
emission processes during the low state are not significantly different to
those in the normal state. The unusual spectral shape observed in the low state
may be a continuation to low fluxes of the normal, flux-dependent spectral
variability of the source.

the influence of very-high-energy physics on the predictions of inflation for

horizon exit can have observable consequences for the CMB, including the
introduction of features in the fluctuation spectrum at specific multipoles and
a general suppression of power at large scales (a prediction which was made
before the recent release of WMAP results). Our comparison of simple models
with the data marginally improves the goodness of fit compared to the standard
concordance cosmology, but only at the 1.5-sigma level. 2. Adiabatic physics
can also affect inflationary predictions through virtual loops of very-heavy

the context of specific models. We believe our conclusions should apply equally
well to trans-Planckian physics provided only that this physics satisfies
decoupling, such as string theory appears to do. (Non-decoupling

violation of this cusp relation indicates the presence of substructure,
regardless of the global, smooth mass model of the lens galaxy. We draw the
following conclusions: (1) the level of substructure present in simulations
produces violations of the cusp relation comparable to those observed, (2)
higher-order catastrophes (e.g. swallowtails) can also cause changes of the
order of 0.6 in the cusp relation as predicted by a smooth model, (3) the flux

brightest minimum and saddle-point images are more affected by substructure
than the fainter images. In addition, the brightest saddle point is demagnified

mass-segregation. This is especially interesting in the case of NGC 2323, which
has an age of only 1.3 times the dynamical relaxation time. The present

glitches, sudden changes in their regular rotational spin-down. According to
the starquake model, the glitch healing parameter, Q, which is measurable in
some cases from pulsar timing, should be equal to the ratio of the moment of
inertia of the superfluid core of a neutron star (NS) to its total moment of
inertia. Measured values of the healing parameter from pulsar glitches can
therefore be used in combination with realistic NS structure models as one test
of the feasibility of the starquake model as a glitch mechanism. We have
constructed NS models using seven representative equations of state of
superdense matter to test whether starquakes can account for glitches observed
in the Crab and Vela pulsars, for which the most extensive and accurate glitch
data are available. We also present a compilation of all measured values of Q
for Crab and Vela glitches to date which have been separately published in the
literature. We have computed the fractional core moment of inertia for stellar
models covering a range of NS masses and find that for stable NSs in the
realistic mass range 1.4 +/- 0.2 solar masses, the fraction is greater than
0.55 in all cases. This range is not consistent with the observational
restriction Q < 0.2 for Vela if starquakes are the cause of its glitches. This
confirms results of previous studies of the Vela pulsar which have suggested
that starquakes are not a feasible mechanism for Vela glitches. The much larger
values of Q observed for Crab glitches (Q > 0.7) are consistent with the
starquake model predictions and support previous conclusions that starquakes
can be the cause of Crab glitches.

a role in accelerating Galactic cosmic rays -- with or without the associated
multiple supernova remnants (eg. Cesarsky & Montmerle, 1983; Bykov 2001). In
this context, the report by the HEGRA Cherenkov telescope group of a steady and
extended unidentified TeV gamma-ray source lying at the outskirts of Cygnus OB2
is particularly significant. This is the most massive stellar association known
in the Galaxy, estimated to contain ~2600 OB type members alone indeed, Cyg OB2

of the extended TeV source region with the CHANDRA X-ray Observatory and the

accurately tracks the radio to gamma-ray emission from primary hadrons as well
as primary and secondary e+/-, we find that the broadband spectrum of the TeV
source region favors a predominantly nucleonic rather than electronic origin of
the high-energy flux, though deeper X-ray and radio observations will help
confirm this. A very reasonable, ~0.1%, conversion efficiency of Cyg OB2's
extreme stellar wind mechanical luminosity to nucleonic acceleration to ~PeV

shows the same variety of morphologies, but without a clear dependence on Lfir
and with a smaller velocity extent. Also, for sources with Lfir above this
limit, the water maser is always present above the 5sigma-level; below it, the
typical 5sigma detection rate is 75-80%. We conclude that there must be a lower
limit to Lfir, below which the associated maser is below the detection level
most of the time. These results can be understood in terms of scaled versions
of similar SFRs with different YSO luminosities, each with many potential sites
of maser amplification, which can be excited provided there is sufficient
energy to pump them, i.e. the basic pumping process is identical regardless of
the YSO luminosity. In SFRs with lower input energies, the conditions of maser
amplification are much closer to the threshold conditions, and consequently
more unstable. We find indications that the properties of the maser emission
may be determined also by the geometry of the SFR, specifically by the beaming
and collimation properties of the outflow driven by the YSO.

observational tool at hand for modern cosmology. It allows to break the
degeneracy of fundamental cosmological parameters one cannot obtain using only
anisotropy data and provides new insight into conditions existing in the very
early Universe. Many experiments are now in progress whose aim is detecting
anisotropy and polarization of the CMB. Measurements of the CMB polarization
are however hampered by the presence of polarized foregrounds, above all the
synchrotron emission of our Galaxy, whose importance increases as frequency
decreases and dominates the polarized diffuse radiation at frequencies below
about 50 GHz. In the past the separation of CMB and synchrotron was made
combining observations of the same area of sky at different frequencies. In
this paper we show that the statistical properties of the polarized components
of the synchrotron and dust foregrounds are different from the statistical
properties of the polarized component of the CMB, therefore one can build a
statistical estimator which allows to extract the polarized component of the
CMB from single frequency data also when the polarized CMB signal is just a
fraction of the total polarized signal. Our estimator improves the signal/noise
ratio for the polarized component of the CMB and reduces from about 50 GHz to
about 20 GHz the frequency above which the polarized component of the CMB can
be extracted from single frequency maps of the diffuse radiation.

study production of high energy gamma-rays in FR I kiloparsec-scale jets by
inverse-Compton emission of the synchrotron-emitting electrons. We consider
different origin of seed photons contributing to the inverse-Compton
scattering, including nuclear jet radiation as well as ambient, stellar and
circumstellar emission of the host galaxies. We discuss how future detections
or non-detections of the evaluated gamma-ray fluxes can provide constraints on
the unknown large scale jet parameters, i.e. the magnetic field intensity and
the jet Doppler factor. For the nearby sources Centaurus A and M 87, we find
measurable fluxes of TeV photons resulting from synchrotron self-Compton
process and from comptonisation of the galactic photon fields, respectively. In
the case of Centaurus A, we also find a relatively strong emission component
due to comptonisation of the nuclear blazar photons, which could be easily
observed by GLAST at energy ~10 GeV, providing important test for the
unification of FR I sources with BL Lac objects.

survey used for a variety of science goals, including surveys of very high
redshift galaxies and weak lensing studies.
  Four high galactic latitude fields, each 2x2 deg^2, have been selected along
the celestial equator: 0226-04, 1003+01, 1400+05, and 2217+00. The 16 deg^2 of
the ""wide"" survey are covered with exposure times of 2h, 1.5h, 1h, 1h, while
the 1.3x1 deg^2 area of the ""deep"" survey at the center of the 0226-04 field is
covered with exposure times of 7h, 4.5h, 3h, 3h, in B,V,R and I respectively.
  The data is pipeline processed at the Terapix facility at the Institut
d'Astrophysique de Paris to produce large mosaic images. The catalogs produced
contain the positions, shape, total and aperture magnitudes for the 2.175
million objects. The depth measured (3sigma in a 3 arc-second aperture) is
I_{AB}=24.8 in the ``Wide'' areas, and I_{AB}=25.3 in the deep area. Careful
quality control has been applied on the data as described in joint papers.
  These catalogs are used to select targets for the VIRMOS-VLT Deep Survey, a
large spectroscopic survey of the distant universe (Le F\`evre et al., 2003).
First results from the CFH12K-VIRMOS survey have been published on weak lensing
(e.g. van Waerbeke & Mellier 2003).
  Catalogs and images are available through the VIRMOS database environment
under Oracle ({\tt http://www.oamp.fr/virmos}). They will be open for general

cross-correlation functions (CCFs) between X-ray energy bands, the slight
decrease of RMS variability from 30 % in the 2-5.9 keV to 19 % in the
15.5--44.4 keV band, as well as the X-ray hardness/flux anti-correlation, are
very similar to what is found in other black hole binaries in the hard state.
The optical/X-ray CCF is virtually independent of the X-ray energies. The
optical flux appears to be correlated not only with the X-ray flux but also
with the X-ray spectral variability. Both the coherence function and the lags
between optical and the X-rays are Fourier frequency dependent. The

rescaled shape on time-scales ranging at least from 0.1 s to few 10 s. Using
the event superposition method we show that the correlation is not triggered by
a single type of event (dip or flare) in the light curves. Instead, optical and

medium (ICM), the CRp produce gamma-rays for which we develop an analytic
formalism to deduce their spectral distribution. Assuming the CRp-to-thermal
energy density ratio X_CRp and the CRp spectral index to be spatially constant,
we derive an analytic relation between the gamma-ray and bolometric X-ray
fluxes, F_gamma and F_X. Based on our relation, we compile a sample of suitable
clusters which are promising candidates for future detection of gamma-rays
resulting from hadronic CRp interactions. Comparing to EGRET upper limits, we
constrain the CRp population in the cooling flow clusters Perseus and Virgo to
X_CRp < 20%. Assuming a plausible value for the CRp diffusion coefficient
kappa, we find the central CRp injection luminosity of M 87 to be limited to
10^43 erg s^-1 kappa/(10^29 cm^2 s^-1). The synchrotron emission from secondary
electrons generated in CRp hadronic interactions allows even tighter limits to
be placed on the CRp population using radio observations. We obtain excellent
agreement between the observed and theoretical radio brightness profiles for
Perseus, but not for Coma without a radially increasing CRp-to-thermal energy
density profile. Since the CRp and magnetic energy densities necessary to
reproduce the observed radio flux are very plausible, we propose synchrotron
emission from secondary electrons as an attractive explanation of the radio
mini-halos found in cooling flow clusters. This model can be tested with future
sensitive gamma-ray observations of the accompanying pi0-decays. We identify
Perseus (A 426), Virgo, Ophiuchus, and Coma (A 1656) as the most promising
candidate clusters for such observations.

The potentials correctly predict the equilibrium crystal structures of the

are applied to calculate the energies of point defects, surfaces, planar faults
in the equilibrium structures. Unlike earlier EAM potentials for the Ti-Al

is extended to multiple systems, we find that `entanglement revival' can also
be observed. In order to study the above effects, we utilise a highly
simplified model for these systems in which all the single-electron energy
eigenvalues are set to be the same (the strong coupling limit), as are the
charging energies of the Cooper Pair Boxes, allowing the whole system to be
represented by two large coupled quantum spins. Although this simplification is
drastic, the model retains the main features necessary to capture the phenomena
of interest. Given the progress in superconducting box experiments over recent
years, it is possible that experiments to investigate both of these interesting
quantum coherent phenomena could be performed in the forseeable future.

was the preparation and the deployment of the software required for the
production of large event samples for the High Level Trigger (HLT) and physics
communities, and the production of those samples as a world-wide distributed
activity. The first phase of DC1 was run during summer 2002, and involved 39
institutes in 18 countries. More than 10 million physics events and 30 million
single particle events were fully simulated. Over a period of about 40 calendar
days 71000 CPU-days were used producing 30 Tbytes of data in about 35000
partitions. In the second phase the next processing step was performed with the
participation of 56 institutes in 21 countries (~ 4000 processors used in
parallel). The basic elements of the ATLAS Monte Carlo production system are
described. We also present how the software suite was validated and the
participating sites were certified. These productions were already partly
performed by using different flavours of Grid middleware at ~ 20 sites.

data analysis framework based on Java. Analysis jobs run through three phases:
discovery of data sets available, brokering/assignment of data sets to analysis
servers, and job execution. Each phase is represented by a set of abstract
interfaces. These interfaces allow different techniques to be used without
modification to the framework. For example, the communications interface has
been implemented by both a packet protocol and a SOAP-based scheme. User
authentication can be provided either through simple passwords or through a GSI
certificates system. Data from CMS HCAL Testbeams, the L3 LEP experiment, and a
hypothetical high-energy linear collider experiment have been interfaced with
the framework.

of laser frequency noise is crucial for obtaining the requisite sensitivity for

monochromatic source - a compact binary - whose direction is known, by using
appropriate data combinations in the module. A stationary source in the
barycentric frame appears to move in the LISA frame and our strategy consists
of ""coherently tracking"" the source by appropriately ""switching"" the data
combinations so that they remain optimal at all times. Assuming that the
polarisation of the source is not known, we average the signal over the
polarisations. We find that the best statistic is the `network' statistic, in
which case LISA can be construed of as two independent detectors. We compare
our results with the Michelson combination, which has been used for obtaining
the standard sensitivity curve for LISA, and with the observable obtained by
optimally switching the three Michelson combinations. We find that for sources
lying in the ecliptic plane the improvement in SNR increases from 34% at low
frequencies to nearly 90% at around 20 mHz. Finally we present the
signal-to-noise ratios for some known binaries in our galaxy. We also show
that, if at low frequencies SNRs of both polarisations can be measured, the
inclination angle of the plane of the orbit of the binary can be estimated.

  General Relativity and Gravitation, University of Tokyo",,,,"gr-qc",,"  Space-time wormholes were introduced in Wheeler's idea of space-time foam.
Traversible wormholes as defined by Morris & Thorne became popular as potential
short cuts across the universe and even time machines. More recently, the
author proposed a general theory of wormhole dynamics, unified with black-hole
dynamics. This article gives a brief review of the above ideas and summarizes
progress on wormhole dynamics in the last year. Firstly, a numerical study of
dynamical perturbations of the first Morris-Thorne wormhole showed it to be
unstable, either collapsing to a black hole or exploding to an inflationary
universe. This provides a mechanism for inflating a wormhole from space-time
foam to usable size. Intriguing critical behaviour was also discovered.
Secondly, a wormhole solution supported by pure radiation was discovered and
used to find analytic examples of dynamic wormhole processes which were also
recently found in a two-dimensional dilaton gravity model: the construction of
a traversible wormhole from a Schwarzschild black hole and vice versa, and the
enlargement or reduction of the wormhole.

  appear in Living Reviews in Relativity","LivingRev.Rel.7:6,2004","10.12942/lrr-2004-6",,"gr-qc",,"  This review is concerned with the motion of a point scalar charge, a point
electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background spacetime. In each
of the three cases the particle produces a field that behaves as outgoing
radiation in the wave zone, and therefore removes energy from the particle. In
the near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force
that prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background
spacetime. The field's action on the particle is difficult to calculate because
of its singular nature: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But
it is possible to isolate the field's singular part and show that it exerts no
force on the particle -- its only effect is to contribute to the particle's
inertia. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is fully
responsible for the self-force. Because this field satisfies a homogeneous wave
equation, it can be thought of as a free (radiative) field that interacts with
the particle; it is this interaction that gives rise to the self-force. The
mathematical tools required to derive the equations of motion of a point scalar
charge, a point electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background
spacetime are developed here from scratch. The review begins with a discussion
of the basic theory of bitensors (part I). It then applies the theory to the
construction of convenient coordinate systems to chart a neighbourhood of the
particle's word line (part II). It continues with a thorough discussion of
Green's functions in curved spacetime (part III). The review concludes with a
detailed derivation of each of the three equations of motion (part IV).

active theoretical debate and development. However, under our experimental
conditions, the theory predicted the combined cross section and polarisation
experimental observables very well indeed. In macroscopic terms, our experiment
measured a birefringence effect in pair production in a crystal. This study of
this effect also constituted a measurement of the energy dependent linear
polarisation of photons produced by coherent bremsstrahlung in aligned
crystals. New technologies for manipulating high energy photon beams can be
realised based on an improved understanding of QED phenomena at these energies.
In particular, this experiment demonstrates an efficient new polarimetry
technique. The pair production measurements were done using two independent
methods simultaneously. The more complex method using a magnet spectrometer
showed that the simpler method using a multiplicity detector was also viable.

with the problems related to the spectrum of the Wilson--Dirac operator, which

to use twisted-mass lattice QCD for the actual computation of the quantities

particularly interesting, as O($a$) improved estimates of physical quantities
can be obtained even without averaging data from lattice formulations with

limits of the dual supergravity backgrounds. The effect of taking the

into an effective truncation to hadrons of large U(1) charge (annulons). We
present an exact calculation of the finite temperature partition function for
the hadronic states corresponding to a Penrose-Gueven limit of the
Maldacena-Nunez embedding of N=1 SYM into string theory. It is established that
the theory exhibits a Hagedorn density of states.
  Motivated by this exact calculation we propose a semiclassical string
approximation to the finite temperature partition function for confining gauge
theories admitting a supergravity dual, by performing an expansion around
classical solutions characterized by temporal windings. This semiclassical
approximation reveals a hadronic energy density of states of Hagedorn type,
with the coefficient determined by the gauge theory string tension as expected
for confining theories. We argue that our proposal captures primarily
information about states of pure N=1 SYM, given that this semiclassical

an elastic string model -- of the kind appropriate for representing a
superconducting cosmic string -- in a flat background. In the case of a
circular equilibrium (i.e. vorton) state of a closed string loop it is shown
that the fundamental axisymmetric ($n=0$) and lowest order ($n=1$)
nonaxisymmetric perturbation modes can never be unstable. However, stability
for modes of higher order ($n\geq 2$) is found to be non-trivially dependent on
the values of the characteristic propagation velocity, $c$ say, of longitudinal
perturbations and of the corresponding extrinsic perturbation velocity, $v$
say. For each mode number the criterion for instability is the existence of
nonreal roots for a certain cubic eigenvalue equation for the corresponding
mode frequency. A very simple sufficient but not necessary condition for
reality of the roots and therefore absence of instability is that the
characteristic velocity ratio, $c/v$ be greater than or equal to unity. Closer
examination of the low velocity (experimentally accessible) nonrelativistic
regime shows that in that limit the criterion for instability is just that the
dimensionless characteristic ratio $c/v$ be less than a critical value $\chi_c$
whose numerical value is approximately $1\over 2$. In the relativistic regime
that is relevant to superconducting cosmic strings the situation is rather
delicate, calling for more detailed investigation that is postponed for future
work.

two clusters have been operated at the two DESY sites in Hamburg and Zeuthen,

classifying the hardware basis to be used. Using the SIMD Streaming Extensions

  28 figures, single-spaced version",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A model is proposed for the statistical analysis of arbitrary-strength
quantum measurements, based on a picture of ""sampling weak values"" from
different configurations of the system. The model is comprised of two elements:
a ""local weak value"" and a ""likelihood factor"". The first describes the
response of an idealized weak measurement situation where the back-reaction on
the system is perfectly controlled. The second assigns a weight factor to
possible configurations of the system. The distribution of the data in a
measurement of arbitrary strength may the be viewed as the net result of
interfering different samples weighted by the likelihood factor, each of which
implements a weak measurement of a different local weak value. It is shown that
the mean and variance of the data can be connected directly to the means and
variances of the sampled weak values. The model is then applied to a situation
similar to a phase transition, where the distribution of the data exhibits two
qualitatively different shapes as the strength parameter is slightly varied
away from a critical value: one below the critical point, where an unusual weak
value is resolved, the other above the critical point, where the spectrum of
the measured observable is resolved. In the picture of sampling, the transition
corresponds to a qualitative change in the sampling profile brought about by
the competition between the prior sampling distribution and the likelihood

quantum state estimation, putting a special emphasis on their asymptotic
behavior. Tomographic measurements and maximum likelihood estimation are used
for estimating several kinds of identically prepared quantum states (bi-photon
polarization states) produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion.
Excess errors in the estimation procedures are eliminated by introducing a new
estimation strategy utilizing Akaike's information criterion. We make a
quantitative comparision between the errors of the experimentally estimated
states and their asymptotic lower bounds, which are derived from the
Cram\'{e}r-Rao inequality. Our results reveal influence of entanglement on the
errors in the estimation. An alternative measurement strategy employing
inseparable measurements is also discussed, and its performance is numerically
explored.

unobservable quantities are introduced the state representation is typically no
longer unique. However, this non-uniqueness does not affect subsequent
inferences based on any observable data. We demonstrate that the inference-free
subspace may be extracted whenever the quantity's unobservability is guaranteed
by a global conservation law. This result can generalize even without such a
guarantee. In particular, we examine the coherent-state representation of a
laser where the absolute phase of the electromagnetic field is believed to be
unobservable. We show that experimental coherent states may be separated from
the inference-free subspaces induced by this unobservable phase. These physical
states may then be approximated by coherent states in a relative-phase Hilbert
space.

The system consists of a small number of atoms with three internal states and
trapped in a far-off resonant optical lattice. Raman lasers provide the
""Josephson"" tunneling, and the collision interaction between atoms represent
the ""capacitive"" couplings between the modes. The qubit states are collective
states of the atoms with opposite persistent currents. This system is closely
analogous to the superconducting flux qubit. Single qubit quantum logic gates
are performed by modulating the Raman couplings, while two-qubit gates result
from a tunnel coupling between neighboring wells. Readout is achieved by tuning
the Raman coupling adiabatically between the Josephson regime to the Rabi
regime, followed by a detection of atoms in internal electronic states.
Decoherence mechanisms are studied in detail promising a high ratio between the
decoherence time and the gate operation time.

constructed based on interference visibility and the uncertainty of the total

number variances) are relatively easily accessible experimentally. The method
may be used to detect entanglement in light fields or in Bose-Einstein
condensates. In contrast to the standard approach based on entanglement
witnesses, the condition is expressed in terms of an inequality which is
nonlinear in expectation values.

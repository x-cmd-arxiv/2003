understanding of the dynamical evolution of planetesimals -- asteroid-like
bodies thought to be planetary building blocks. In this study we investigate
the growth of eccentricities and inclinations of planetesimals in spatially
homogeneous protoplanetary disks using methods of kinetic theory. We explore
disks with a realistic mass spectrum of planetesimals evolving in time, similar
to that obtained in self-consistent simulations of planetesimal coagulation. We
calculate the behavior of planetesimal random velocities as a function of the
planetesimal mass spectrum both analytically and numerically; results obtained
by the two approaches agree quite well. Scaling of random velocity with mass
can always be represented as a combination of power laws corresponding to
different velocity regimes (shear- or dispersion-dominated) of planetesimal
gravitational interactions. For different mass spectra we calculate
analytically the exponents and time dependent normalizations of these power
laws, as well as the positions of the transition regions between different
regimes. It is shown that random energy equipartition between different
planetesimals can only be achieved in disks with very steep mass distributions
(differential surface number density of planetesimals falling off steeper than
m^{-4}), or in the runaway tails. In systems with shallow mass spectra
(shallower than m^{-3}) random velocities of small planetesimals turn out to be
independent of their masses. We also discuss the damping effects of inelastic
collisions between planetesimals and of gas drag, and their importance in
modifying planetesimal random velocities.

investigate two models based on the existence of a 'universal' dark matter

relaxed clusters can be fitted by phenomenological formulae proposed in the
literature. Haloes that have experienced a recent merging event are
systematically less concentrated and show steeper profiles than relaxed objects
near the centre. The hot X-ray emitting gas is found to be in approximate
hydrostatic equilibrium with the dark matter potential, and it is well
described by a polytropic equation of state. Analytic formulae for the gas
density and temperature can be derived from these premises. Though able to
reproduce the X-ray surface brightness, the beta-model is shown to provide a
poor description of our numerical clusters. We find strong evidence of a
'universal' temperature profile that decreases by a factor of 2-3 from the
centre to the virial radius, whereas baryon fraction and entropy are
monotonically increasing functions. Numerical resolution and entropy
conservation play a key role in the shapes of the profiles at small radii.

X-ray luminous sources in our sample do not tend to be luminous in the
infrared. All SBS NLS1s are radio quiet objects ($ \log L_{R}<40.0$), and 52%
of them are strong FeII emitters (FeII$\lambda4570/H\beta >1$). The traditional
linear correlation $L_x$ and $L_{op}$, which seems to hold for AGN in general,
is found for SBS NLS1s. An anticorrelation between FWHM of ${H\beta}$ and the
ratio of FeII$\lambda4570/H\beta$ is also observed. A weak correlation is found
between $\alpha_{ox}$ slope and $L_{op}$. One of our main findings is that
almost all SBS NLS1s may not have a FIR bump. Their SED suggest that they may
also possess a BBB. The absence of IR bump in most of SBS NLS1s and the
weakness of X-ray radiation in some of them, may argue against the presence of
a BLR. The surface density of SBS NLS1s is $<$ 0.015 per $deg.^2$ ($B<17.5,

truly distorted star since $\alpha$ Eridani exhibited negligible H$\alpha$

that the commonly adopted Roche approximation (uniform rotation and centrally

reaching 0.5 mag. The most common structure observed during this stage was
sinusoidal wave characterized by a period of about 0.1 days.
  Comparing KS UMa to other SU UMa stars we conclude that this group of dwarf
novae shows decreasing superhump periods at the beginning and the end of

diffuse H_2 molecular clouds along six sightlines. There is no evidence from
this study that H_2 exists well inside the perimeter of the LB. The kinematical
temperature for H_2 is less than the usual temperature observed in the local
interstellar clouds, implying different gas phases in the LISM. The relative
abundance ratios of Si II, P II, and Fe II give insight about the dust content.
These ratios vary, but are similar to the depletion patterns observed in warm
and halo diffuse clouds in more distant sightlines in the Galaxy. The N I/O I
and Ar I/O I ratios are significantly subsolar within the LB. Outside the LB a
larger scatter is observed from subsolar to solar. Because Ar and N are only
weakly depleted into dust grains if at all, the deficiencies of their neutral
forms are likely due to photoionization. The evidence for significant
ionization of N (and hence Ar) is strengthened by the detection and measurement
of N II, which is a dominant ion for this element toward many sightlines. These
observations imply that photoionization is the main ionization mechanism in the
LISM and do not support the existence of a highly ionized condition in the

an average amplitude of ~15%. The excess variance of the light curve is smaller
than that of Seyfert galaxies, entirely consistent with the relationship
between variability amplitude and luminosity defined from the Seyfert data
alone. The power spectrum of the source follows a power-like form of slope ~
-1. However, when we extend the power spectrum estimation at higher frequencies
using archival ASCA data, we find strong evidence for an intrinsic steepening
to a slope of ~ -2 at around ~ 1x10^(-6) Hz. This ""break frequency"" corresponds
to a time scale of ~ 10 days. The time-average energy spectrum is well fitted
by a power law model with Gamma ~ 2. We also find evidence for an iron line at
\~ 6.4 keV (rest frame) with EW 110 eV, similar to what is observed in Seyfert
galaxies. The flux variations are not associated with any spectral variation.

complete spin-charge separation -- are found to be much larger than E_{bound}.
Examination of n(k) shows that the large increse in KE is due to excessive
depletion of electrons from the bottom of the band (Schwinger boson) and of
holes from the top (slave boson). To see whether the excess KE is simply due to
poor treatment of the constraints, I solve the constraint problem analytically
for the Schwinger boson case in the J = 0 limit. This restores gauge
invariance, incorrectly violated in MF theories. The result is a generalized
Hartree-Fock state of the Hubbard model, but one that includes spin waves. Even
after constraints are imposed correctly, the KE remains much larger than
E_{bound}. These results support the notion, advanced earlier [PRB 61, 8663

makes the state unstable toward recombination processes which lead to
superconductivity in d = 2 and a Fermi liquid state in higher dimensions.

The results show that network boundary specification and fixed choice designs

underestimated via actor non-response, which results in inflated measurement

undistorted perovskite structure. Electron doping in Sr$_2$CrWO$_6$ by a
partial substitution of Sr$^{2+}$ by La$^{3+}$ was found to reduce both $T_C$
and the saturation magnetization $M_s$. The reduction of $M_s$ could be
attributed both to band structure effects and the Cr/W antisites induced by
doping. Band structure calculations for Sr$_2$CrWO$_6$ predict an energy gap in
the spin-up band, but a finite density of states for the spin-down band. The
predictions of the band structure calculation are consistent with our optical

configurations were used for each Hall bar by reversing the current and the

studied and we observed that the critical current for the contact resistance
increases with the width of the Hall bar as previously observed for the
critical current of the longitudinal resistance. The critical currents exhibit
either a linear or a sublinear increase. All our observations are interpreted
in the current understanding of the Quantum hall effect brekdown. Our analysis
suggests that a heated region appears at the current contact, develops and then

generating the higher-order Fourier harmonics at wave-vectors nQ in the spatial
spin configuration. These features are not captured in the formalism based on
the Luttinger-Tisza theorem, where the classical ground state energy is
minimized under the ``weak'' condition on the length of the spins. We discuss
why the correct solution is lost in that approach and present an alternative

ROOT objects but many foreign objects and templates. In this context, we have
compared the performance of ROOT containers versus the STL vectors, and the use

calculate the critical exponents at the second order phase transition and find

$r = h(angle)$ for some single-valued function $h: S^2 \to \Re^+$. The AH

coefficients are algebraic functions of $g_{ij}$, $K_{ij}$, and the
Cartesian-coordinate spatial derivatives of $g_{ij}$. I discretize $S^2$ using
6 angular patches (one each in the neighborhood of the $\pm x$, $\pm y$, and
$\pm z$ axes) to avoid coordinate singularities, and finite difference the AH
equation in the angular coordinates using 4th order finite differencing. I

minimisation of the thermodynamic potential. Color and electric charge
neutrality conditions are imposed through introduction of appropriate chemical

through minimisation of the thermodynamic potential. The equation of state is

Born-Infeld string. The dependence of the geometry of these configurations on
the Born-Infeld fields is analyzed. Also we find that similar BIon

Furthermore this configuration is demonstrated to be more stable than the usual
dielectric spherical D2-brane.

${\cal N}=4$ SYM theory in the infinite momentum frame but with constant
momentum density is attempted. In the absence of the content of
noncommutativity, it has been known for some time that the previous
$AdS_{5}/CFT_{4}$ correspondence should be replaced by the $K_{5}/CFT_{4}$
(with $K_{(p+2)}$ denoting the generalized Kaigorodov spacetime) correspondence
with the pp-wave propagating on the BPS brane worldvolume. Interestingly
enough, putting together the two contents, i.e., the introduction of
noncommutativity and at the same time that of the pp-wave along the brane
worldvolume, leads to quite nontrivial consequences such as the emergence of
``time-space'' noncommutativity in addition to the ``space-space''
noncommutativity in the manifold on which the dual gauge theory is defined.
Taking the gravity decoupling limit, it has been realized that for small $u$,
the solutions all reduce to $K_{5}\times S^5$ geometry confirming our
expectation that the IR dynamics of the dual gauge theory should be unaffected
by the noncommutativity while as $u\to \infty$, the solutions start to deviate
significantly from $K_{5}\times S^5$ limit indicating that the UV dynamics of
the dual gauge theory would be heavily distorted by the effect of
noncommutativity.

singularity, two singular terms are generally present. The first of them, a
logarithmic one, is axially symmetric with respect to the boundary normal at
the charge location, and proportional to the sum of the two principal
curvatures of the boundary surface at this point, that is, to the local mean
curvature. The second term is asymmetric and proportional to the difference of
the two principal curvatures in question; it is also bounded at the charge
location. Both terms vanish, apparently, if the charge is at a planar point of
the boundary, and only in this case. The field in the charge vicinity behaves
accordingly, featuring generally two singular terms proportional to the inverse
distance, in addition to the main inverse distance squared singularity. This
result is significant, in particular, for studying the interaction of magnetic

The proof is based on the graphical technique established by Yutsis, et al. and
through a definition of a reduced $6-j$ symbol. The resulting $3n-j$ symbols
thereby take a combinatorial form which is simply the product of two factors.
The one is an integer or polynomial which is the single sum over the products
of reduced $6-j$ symbols. They are in the form of summing over the products of
binomial coefficients. The other is a multiplication of all the triangle
relations appearing in the symbols, which can also be rewritten using binomial
coefficients. The new formulation indicates that the intrinsic structure for
the general recoupling coefficients is much nicer and simpler, which might
serves as a bridge for the study with other fields. Along with our newly
developed algorithms, this also provides a basis for a direct, exact and
efficient calculation or tabulation of all the $3n-j$ symbols of the SU(2)
group for all range of quantum angular momentum arguments. As an illustration,

These eigenfunctions, when normalized, constitute an orthonormal basis in the
representation space. The initial U_q(su(1,1))-basis and the basis of
eigenfunctions are interrelated by a matrix with entries, expressed in terms of
big q-Laguerre polynomials. The unitarity of this connection matrix leads to an
orthogonal system of functions, which are dual with respect to big q-Laguerre
polynomials. This system of functions consists of two separate sets of
functions, which can be expressed in terms of q-Meixner polynomials
M_n(x;b,c;q) either with positive or negative values of the parameter b. The
orthogonality property of these two sets of functions follows directly from the
unitarity of the connection matrix. As a consequence, one obtains an
orthogonality relation for q-Meixner polynomials M_n(x;b,c;q) with b<0. A
biorthogonal system of functions (with respect to the scalar product in the

We pay special attention to the opening-closing dynamics of double-stranded DNA

stress imposed at one terminal end of the DNA molecule brings it into a
partially opened configuration. We examine the subsequent relaxation dynamics
connected with energy exchange processes between the various degrees of freedom

double-stranded conformation. The similarities and differences between the
relaxation dynamics for a planar ladder-like DNA molecule and a twisted one are
discussed in detail. In this way we show that the attainment of a

the velocity of the complete recombination of the DNA molecule is lower than
the velocity imposed by the forcing unit which is in compliance with the

production in deuteron-gold collisions measured RHIC relies on Glauber
calculations for the inelastic d-Au cross section. These calculations should be
corrected for diffraction. Moreover, they miss the Gribov's inelastic shadowing
which makes nuclei more transparent (color transparency). The magnitude of this
effect rises with energy and it may dramatically affect the normalization of
the RHIC data. We evaluate these corrections employing the light-cone dipole
formalism and found a rather modest corrections for the current normalization
of the d-Au data. The results of experiments insensitive to diffraction
(PHENIX, PHOBOS) should be renormalized by about 20% down, while those which
include diffraction (STAR), by only 10%. Such a correction completely
eliminates the Cronin enhancement in the PHENIX data for pions. The largest
theoretical uncertainty comes from the part of the inelastic shadowing which is
related to diffractive gluon radiation, or gluon shadowing. Our estimate is
adjusted to data for the triple-Pomeron coupling, however, other models do not
have such a restrictions and predict much stronger gluon shadowing. Therefore,
the current data for high-pT hadron production in d-Au collisions at RHIC
cannot exclude in a model independent way the possibility if initial state
suppression proposed by Kharzeev-Levin-McLerran. Probably the only way to
settle this uncertainty is a direct measurement of the inelastic d-Au cross
sections at RHIC. Also d-Au collisions with a tagged spectator nucleon may
serve as a sensitive probe for nuclear transparency and inelastic shadowing. We
found an illuminating quantum-mechanical effect: the nucleus acts like a lens
focusing spectators into a very narrow cone.

submission and distributed data management developed and used in the context of
ALICE, the CERN LHC heavy-ion experiment. With the aim of exploiting upcoming
Grid resources to run AliEn-managed jobs and store the produced data, the
problem of AliEn-EDG interoperability was addressed and an in-terface was
designed. One or more EDG (European Data Grid) User Interface machines run the
AliEn software suite (Cluster Monitor, Storage Element and Computing Element),
and act as interface nodes between the systems. An EDG Resource Broker is seen
by the AliEn server as a single Computing Element, while the EDG storage is
seen by AliEn as a single, large Storage Element; files produced in EDG sites
are registered in both the EDG Replica Catalogue and in the AliEn Data
Catalogue, thus ensuring accessibility from both worlds. In fact, both
registrations are required: the AliEn one is used for the data management, the
EDG one to guarantee the integrity and access to EDG produced data. A prototype
interface has been successfully deployed using the ALICE AliEn Server and the
EDG and DataTAG Testbeds.

  MOJT009",,,,"physics.comp-ph",,"  We present the approach used for defining the event object model for the LHCb
experiment. This approach is based on a high level modelling language, which is
independent of the programming language used in the current implementation of
the event data processing software. The different possibilities of object
modelling languages are evaluated, and the advantages of a dedicated model
based on XML over other possible candidates are shown. After a description of
the language itself, we explain the benefits obtained by applying this approach
in the description of the event model of an experiment such as LHCb. Examples
of these benefits are uniform and coherent mapping of the object model to the
implementation language across the experiment software development teams, easy
maintenance of the event model, conformance to experiment coding rules, etc.
  The description of the object model is parsed by means of a so called
front-end which allows to feed several back-ends. We give an introduction to
the model itself and to the currently implemented back-ends which produce
information like programming language specific implementations of event objects
or meta information about these objects. Meta information can be used for
introspection of objects at run-time which is essential for functionalities
like object persistency or interactive analysis. This object introspection
package for C++ has been adopted by the LCG project as the starting point for
the LCG object dictionary that is going to be developed in common for the LHC
experiments.
  The current status of the event object modelling and its usage in LHCb are
presented and the prospects of further developments are discussed.

electron neutrinos or their antiparticles through the decay of radioactive ions
circulating in a storage ring. This concept requires radioactive ions to be
accelerated to a Lorentz gamma of 150 for 6He and 60 for 18Ne. The neutrino
source itself consists of a storage ring for this energy range, with long
straight sections in line with the experiment(s). Such a decay ring does not
exist at CERN today, nor does a high-intensity proton source for the production
of the radioactive ions. Nevertheless, the existing CERN accelerator
infrastructure could be used as this would still represent an important saving
for a beta-beam facility. This paper outlines the first study, while some of
the more speculative ideas will need further investigations.

PID algorithm is able to cope with non-Gaussian noise as well as with ambiguous
measurements in a high-density environment. The occupancy can reach up to 40%
and due to the overlaps, often the points along the track are lost and others
are significantly displaced. In the present algorithm, first, clusters are
found and the space points are reconstructed. The shape of a cluster provides
information about overlap factor. Fast spline unfolding algorithm is applied
for points with distorted shapes. Then, the expected space point error is
estimated using information about the cluster shape and track parameters.
Furthermore, available information about local track overlap is used. Tests are
performed on simulation data sets to validate the analysis and to gain
practical experience with the algorithm.

evolution parameter is related through a probability distribution to the
physical time, which is assumed to be discrete. In this way, a physical clock
with discrete states is introduced, which presently is still treated as
decoupled from the system. This is motivated by the recent discussion of
``timeless'' reparametrization invariant models, where discrete physical time
has been constructed based on quasi-local observables. Employing the
path-integral formulation of classical mechanics developed by Gozzi et al., we
show that these deterministic classical systems can be naturally described as
unitary quantum mechanical models. We derive the emergent quantum Hamiltonian
in terms of the underlying classical one. Such Hamiltonians typically need a
regularization - here performed by discretization - in order to arrive at
models with a stable groundstate in the continuum limit. This is demonstrated
in several examples, recovering and generalizing a model advanced by 't Hooft.

particular for an important special case of a vanishing time averaged
perturbation operator, i.e. vanishing expectation values of the perturbation in
the eigenbasis of unperturbed dynamics. A complete semiclassical picture of
this situation is derived in which we show that the quantum fidelity of
individual coherent initial states exhibits three different regimes in time:
(i) first it follows the corresponding classical fidelity up to time
t1=hbar^(-1/2), (ii) then it freezes on a plateau of constant value, (iii) and
after a time scale t_2=min[hbar^(1/2) delta^(-2),hbar^(-1/2) delta^(-1)] it
exhibits fast ballistic decay as exp(-const. delta^4 t^2/hbar) where delta is a
strength of perturbation. All the constants are computed in terms of classical
dynamics for sufficiently small effective value hbar of the Planck constant. A
similar picture is worked out also for general initial states, and specifically
for random initial states, where t_1=1, and t_2=delta^(-1). This prolonged
stability of quantum dynamics in the case of a vanishing time averaged
perturbation could prove to be useful in designing quantum devices. Theoretical
results are verified by numerical experiments on the quantized integrable top.

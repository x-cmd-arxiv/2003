detected in He2-104, V1329 Cyg and possibly HD 149427. In He2-104 we detected
the [OIII] and Halpha counterparts to the inner lobes found in [NII] by Corradi

indicates expanding ejecta which may be associated with an ejection event in
1982 (+/-2 years) at a velocity of 260 +/- 50 km/s in the plane of the sky and
at an assumed distance of 3.4kpc. We also present previously unpublished radio

similar orientation to that of the possible optical extension. Finally we also
include HST/WFPC2 GO observations of AG Peg and detect possible extended

  At odd, there are several spiral members with open arm configurations as
expected in interacting systems. At the same time, emission lines in the

diagnostic diagrams (Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987). None of the objects displays
unambiguous indication of nuclear activity, although fourspiral nuclei could be
ascribed to the class of Seyferts. The star formation rate seems enhanced over
the average expected in spiral galaxies only for poorer SSSGs in particular

dwarf galaxy I Zw 18. The new data represent an improvement over previous FUSE
spectra by a factor of 1.7 in the signal-to-noise. Together with a larger
spectral coverage (917-1188 angstroms), this allows us to characterize
absorption lines in the interstellar medium with unprecedented accuracy. The
kinematics averaged over the large sampled region shows no clear evidence of
gas inflows or outflows. The H I absorption is interstellar with a column
density of 2.2 (+0.6,-0.5} * 10^21 cm^(-2). A conservative 3 sigma upper limit
of 5.25 * 10^(14) cm^(-2) is derived for the column density of diffuse H_2.
  From a simultaneous fitting of metal absorption lines in the interstellar
medium, we infer the following abundances: [Fe/H] = -1.76 +/- 0.12, [O/H] =
-2.06 +/- 0.28, [Si/H] = -2.09 +/- 0.12, [Ar/H] = -2.27 +/- 0.13, and [N/H] =
-2.88 +/- 0.11. This is in general several times lower than in the H II
regions. The only exception is iron, whose abundance is the same. The abundance
pattern of the interstellar medium suggests ancient star-formation activity
with an age of at least a Gyr that enriched the H I phase. Around 470 SNe Ia
are required to produce the iron content. A more recent episode that started 10
to several 100 Myr ago is responsible for the additional enrichment of
alpha-elements and nitrogen in the H II regions.

and gamma_r are continuous, although their first derivatives are discontinuous.
We extend, for the case of nonzero field, a recently proposed hypothesis,
namely that the density of uncanceled degrees of freedom is a ``free energy''
for Rigidity Percolation. Analytic expressions are obtained for the energy,
entropy, and specific heat. Some analogies with a liquid-vapor transition are
discussed. Particularizing to zero field, we find that the existence of a
(g+1)-core is a necessary condition for rigidity percolation with g degrees of
freedom. At the transition point gamma_c, Maxwell counting of degrees of
freedom is exact on the rigid cluster and on the (g+1)-rigid-core, i.e. the
average coordination of these subgraphs is exactly 2g, although gamma_r, the
average coordination of the whole system, is smaller than 2g. gamma_c is found
to converge to 2g for large g, i.e. in this limit Maxwell counting is exact
globally as well. This paper is dedicated to Dietrich Stauffer, on the occasion
of his 60th birthday.

of the distribution function of the EFG are calculated taking into account
local lattice deformations due to mass defects in the close neighborhood of the

we study, we find that the random walk obeys a characteristic scaling form.
These properties include the average number of distinct sites visited by the
random walker, the mean-square displacement of the walker, and the distribution
of first-return times. The scaling form has three characteristic time regimes.
At short times, the walker does not see the small-world shortcuts and
effectively probes an ordinary Euclidean network in $d$-dimensions. At
intermediate times, the properties of the walker shows scaling behavior
characteristic of an infinite small-world network. Finally, at long times, the
finite size of the network becomes important, and many of the properties of the
walker saturate. We propose general analytical forms for the scaling properties
in all three regimes, and show that these analytical forms are consistent with

each have different capabilities for enforcing the policy. The Community
Authorization Service (CAS) solves this problem by allowing resource providers
to delegate some policy authority to the VO while maintaining ultimate control
over their resources. In this paper we describe CAS and our past and current
implementations of CAS, and we discuss our plans for CAS-related research.

build, configuration, debug, binding, and analysis tools. ASK automates many
error-prone tasks that are otherwise left to the end-user, thereby pre-empting
a whole category of potential problems. Through the existing tools, which ASK
will setup for the user if and as needed, it locates available resources,
maintains job coherency, manages the run-time environment, allows for
interactivity and debugging, and provides standalone execution scripts. An
end-user who wants to run her own analysis algorithms within the standard
environment can let ASK generate the appropriate skeleton package, the needed
dependencies and run-time, as well as a default job options script. For new and
casual users, ASK comes with a graphical user interface; for advanced users,
ASK has a scriptable command line interface. Both are built on top of the same
set of libraries. ASK does not need to be, and isn't, experiment neutral. Thus
it has built-in workarounds for known gotcha's, that would otherwise be a major
time-sink for each and every new user. ASK minimizes the overhead for those
physicists in Atlas who just want to write and run their analysis code.

This WAN aspect of Grid applications makes the use of conventional monitoring
and instrumentation tools (such as top, gprof, LSF Monitor, etc) impractical
for verification that the application is running correctly and efficiently. To
be effective, monitoring data must be ""end-to-end"", meaning that all components
between the Grid application endpoints must be monitored. Instrumented
applications can generate a large amount of monitoring data, so typically the
instrumentation is off by default. For jobs running on a Grid, there needs to
be a general mechanism to remotely activate the instrumentation in running
jobs. The NetLogger Toolkit Activation Service provides this mechanism.
  To demonstrate this, we have instrumented the ATLAS Athena Framework with
NetLogger to generate monitoring events. We then use a GMA-based activation
service to control NetLogger's trigger mechanism. The NetLogger trigger
mechanism allows one to easily start, stop, or change the logging level of a
running program by modifying a trigger file. We present here details of the
design of the NetLogger implementation of the GMA-based activation service and
the instrumentation service for Athena. We also describe how this activation
service allows us to non-intrusively collect and visualize the ATLAS Athena

  This paper discusses and evaluates several techniques to support
long-distance fast file replication. The Grid Datafarm manages a ranked group
of files as a Gfarm file, each file, called a Gfarm file fragment, being stored
on a filesystem node, or replicated on several filesystem nodes. Each Gfarm
file fragment is replicated independently and in parallel using rate-controlled

we exploit the equivalence between the classical canonical averages and
transfer matrix quantum traces of the anharmonic oscillator to obtain exact
results for the temperature dependence of several observables, which provide a
set of criteria for thermalization. We find that the Hartree approximation is
remarkably accurate in equilibrium. The non-equilibrium dynamics is studied by
numerically solving the equations of motion in light-cone coordinates for a
broad range of initial conditions and energy densities.The time evolution is
described by several stages with a cascade of energy towards the ultraviolet.
After a transient stage, the spatio-temporal gradient terms become larger than
the nonlinear term and a stage of universal cascade emerges.This cascade starts
at a time scale t_0 independent of the initial conditions (except for very low
energy density). Here the power spectra feature universal scaling behavior and
the front of the cascade k(t) grows as a power law k(t) sim t^alpha with alpha
lesssim 0.25. The wake behind the cascade is described as a state of Local
Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) with all correlations being determined by the
equilibrium functional form with an effective time dependent temperatureTeff(t)
which slowly decreases as sim t^{-alpha}.Two well separated time scales emerge
while Teff(t) varies slowly, the wavectors in the wake with k < k(t) attain LTE
on much shorter time scales.This universal scaling stage ends when the front of
the cascade reaches the cutoff at a time t_1 sim a^{-1/alpha}. Virialization
starts to set much earlier than LTE. We find that strict thermalization is
achieved only for an infinite time scale.

tantalizing perks come from the hypothesis: lessened flavor and CP violation

admits an expansion in positive powers of g_eff = \lambda/(J + 2 J')^2: E= J +
2 J' + g_eff J' + ... . This suggests a possibility of a direct comparison with
perturbative SYM results for the corresponding anomalous dimensions in the
sector with g_eff << 1, by analogy with the BMN case. We conjecture that all
quantum sigma model string corrections are then subleading at large J', so that
the classical formula for the energy is effectively exact to all orders in
\lambda. It could then be interpolated to weak coupling, representing a
prediction for the anomalous dimensions on the SYM side. We test this
conjecture by computing the 1-loop superstring sigma model correction to the
classical energy.

$N$ limit and as 1/N expansions, in the case of vector representations. Since
invariant composite fields have small fluctuations for large $N$, the method
relies on constructing effective field theories for composite fields after
integration over the original degrees of freedom. We first solve a general
scalar $U(\phib^2)$ field theory for $N$ large and discuss various
non-perturbative physical issues such as critical behaviour. We show how large
$N$ results can also be obtained from variational calculations.We illustrate
these ideas by showing that the large $N$ expansion allows to relate the
$(\phib^2)^2$ theory and the non-linear $\sigma$-model, models which are
renormalizable in different dimensions. Similarly, a relation between $CP(N-1)$
and abelian Higgs models is exhibited. Large $N$ techniques also allow solving
self-interacting fermion models. A relation between the Gross--Neveu, a theory
with a four-fermi self-interaction, and a Yukawa-type theory renormalizable in
four dimensions then follows. We discuss dissipative dynamics, which is
relevant to the approach to equilibrium, and which in some formulation exhibits
quantum mechanics supersymmetry. This also serves as an introduction to the
study of the 3D supersymmetric quantum field theory. Large $N$ methods are
useful in problems that involve a crossover between different dimensions. We
thus briefly discuss finite size effects, finite temperature scalar and
supersymmetric field theories. We also use large $N$ methods to investigate the
weakly interacting Bose gas. The solution of the general scalar $U(\phib^2)$
field theory is then applied to other issues like tricritical behaviour and
double scaling limit.

  symmetries of the vacuum","17 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  This is the first paper in a series in which an attempt is made to formulate
a perturbation theory around the the Chern-Simons state of quantum gravity
discovered by Kodama. It is based on an extension of the theory of 't Hooft
Deser and Jackew describing point particles in 3D gravity to four spacetime
dimensions. General covariance now requires the basic excitations to be
extended in one spatial dimension rather than pointlike. As a consequence the
symmetry of the Kodama state, which is the (anti)deSitter symmetry, is realized
'holographically' on a timelike boundary, the generators of this symmetry being
related to quasilocal energy-momenta. As GR induces a Chern-Simons theory on
the boundary, the deSitter symmetry of the vacuum must be q-deformed with the
deformation parameter related to the cosmological constant. It is proposed to
introduce excitations around this vacuum by putting punctures on the boundary
to each of which is associate a vector in some representation of deSitter group
projected to the boundary. By equations of motion those punctures must be
connected by continuous lines of fluxes of an SO(3,1) gauge field. It is also
argued that quasilocal masses and spins of these excitations must satisfy a
relation of Regge type, which may point on a possible relation between
non-perturbative quantum gravity and string theory.

contradiction of the Ca(2+):ATP stoichiometry of 1:1 during a translocation
step and the observation that the pump binds two calcium ions at the
intracellular site. The combination of the calcium pumping and the stimulation
model correctly describes PMCA function. We find that the processes of
calmodulin-calcium complex attachment to the pump and of stimulation have to be
separated. Other PMCA properties are discussed in the framework of the model.
The presented model can serve as a tool for calcium dynamics simulations and
provides the possibility to characterize different pump isoforms by different
type-specific parameter sets.

magnetic and electric dipole moments in the presence of an electromagnetic
field. The analysis of this dynamics demonstrates the appearance of a quantum
phase that combines the Aharonov-Casher effect and the He-Mckellar-Wilkens
effect. We demonstrate that this phase is a special case of the Berry's quantum
phase. A series of field configurations where this phase would be found are
presented. A generalized Casella-type effect is found in one these
configurations. A physical scenario for the quantum phase in an interferometric
experiment is proposed.

propose and analyze a two-to-four qubit encoding scheme, which can recover the
loss of one qubit in the transmission. This device acts as a repeater when it
is placed in series to cover a distance larger than the attenuation length of
the fiber, and it acts as an optical quantum memory when it is inserted in a
fiber loop. We call this dual-purpose device a ``quantum transponder.''

structure makes traditional laser cooling difficult. For instance, laser
cooling of hydrogen requires vacuum-ultraviolet laser light, while
multielectron atoms need laser light at many widely separated frequencies.
These restrictions can be eased by laser cooling on two-photon transitions with
ultrafast pulse trains. Laser cooling of hydrogen, antihydrogen, and carbon
appears feasible, and extension of the technique to molecules may be possible.

  Magnetic Resonance: Implementation of a Quantum Algorithm","16 pages, 3 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.68.032304",,"quant-ph",,"  Physical implementation of Quantum Information Processing (QIP) by
liquid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), using weakly coupled spin-1/2
nuclei of a molecule, is well established. Nuclei with spin$>$1/2 oriented in
liquid crystalline matrices is another possibility. Such systems have multiple
qubits per nuclei and large quadrupolar couplings resulting in well separated
lines in the spectrum. So far, creation of pseudopure states and logic gates
have been demonstrated in such systems using transition selective
radio-frequency pulses. In this paper we report two novel developments. First,
we implement a quantum algorithm which needs coherent superposition of states.
Second, we use evolution under quadrupolar coupling to implement multi qubit
gates. We implement Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm on a spin-3/2 (2 qubit) system. The
controlled-not operation needed to implement this algorithm has been
implemented here by evolution under the quadrupolar Hamiltonian. This method
has been implemented for the first time in quadrupolar systems. Since the
quadrupolar coupling is several orders of magnitude greater than the coupling
in weakly coupled spin-1/2 nuclei, the gate time decreases, increasing the
clock speed of the quantum computer.

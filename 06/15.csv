isotropic MHD turbulence with no mean magnetic field. This problem is
essentially different from the case with externally imposed uniform mean field.
There is no scale-by-scale equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energies
as would be the case for the Alfven-wave turbulence. The isotropic MHD
turbulence is the end state of the turbulent dynamo which generates folded
fields with small-scale direction reversals. We propose that the statistics
seen in numerical simulations of isotropic MHD turbulence could be explained as
a superposition of these folded fields and Alfven-like waves that propagate
along the folds.

jellium model, to study the stability of $Z$-ply charged metal clusters of
different species against fragmentation. We have shown that on the one hand,
singly ionized clusters are stable against any spontaneous fragmentation, and
on the other hand, the most favored decay process for them is atomic
evaporation. However, multiply charged clusters of sufficiently small sizes may
undergo spontaneous decay via fission processes. Comparing the results for
different species show that for fixed $N$, the lower electron density metal
clusters can accommodate more excess charges before their Coulomb explosions.
This comparison also shows that, for fixed $Z$, the atomic evaporation which is
the most favored decay mechanism for sufficiently large clusters, takes place
at lower $N$s for lower electron density clusters.

significantly. In the absence of carriers, this room-temperature ferromagnetism

little use of the distributed disk space that is available in commodity

distribute the tasks through all the nodes and retrieve the result, merging

Both selection and mutation act on individual organisms. Consistent with some
current theories of macroevolutionary dynamics, the model displays
intermittent, statistically self-similar behavior with punctuated equilibria.
The probability density for the lifetimes of ecological communities is well
approximated by a power law with exponent near -2, and the corresponding power
spectral densities show 1/f noise (flicker noise) over several decades. The
long-lived communities (quasi-steady states) consist of a relatively small
number of mutualistically interacting species, and they are surrounded by a
``protection zone'' of closely related genotypes that have a very low
probability of invading the resident community. The extent of the protection
zone affects the stability of the community in a way analogous to the height of
the free-energy barrier surrounding a metastable state in a physical system.

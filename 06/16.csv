simulations for a Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) cosmology with non-Gaussian
initial conditions (NGICs). The initial statistics are lognormal in the
gravitational potential field with positive (LNp) and negative (LNn) skewness;
the sign of the skewness is conserved by the density field, and the power
spectrum is the same for all the simulations. Our aim is not to test a given
non-Gaussian statistics, but to explore the generic effect of positive- and
negative-skew statistics on halo properties. From our low-resolution
simulations, we find that LNp (LNn) halos are systematically more (less)
concentrated than their Gaussian counterparts. This result is confirmed by our
Milky Way- and cluster-sized halos resimulated with high-resolution. In
addition, they show inner density profiles that depend on the statistics: the
innermost slopes of LNp (LNn) halos are steeper (shallower) than those obtained
from the corresponding Gaussian halos. A subhalo population embedded in LNp
halos is more susceptible to destruction than its counterpart inside Gaussian
halos. On the other hand, subhalos in LNn halos tend to survive longer than
subhalos in Gaussian halos. The spin parameter probability distribution of LNp
(LNn) halos is skewed to smaller (larger) values with respect to the Gaussian
case. Our results show how the statistics of the primordial density field can
influence some halo properties, opening this the possibility to constrain,
although indirectly, the primordial statistics at small scale.

0.055 and no mean bias. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the
influence of the errors in distance associated with photometric redshifts on
our ability to reconstruct the shape of the luminosity function. Finally, we
construct the rest-frame K-band LF in four redshift bins spanning 0.4<z<1.2 and
compare our results to the local luminosity function. We discuss and apply two
different estimators to derive likely values for the evolution of the number
density, Phi*, and characteristic luminosity, M*, with redshift. While the
first estimator relies on the value of the luminosity function binned in
magnitude and redshift, the second estimator uses the individually measured
{M,z} pairs alone. In both cases we obtain a mild decrease in number density by
\~ 25% to z=1 accompanied by brightening of the galaxy population by 0.5 to 0.7
mag. These results are fully consistent with an analogous analysis using only

of the effects due to the instrumental bandpass, we detect a signature in the
MCF of our PSR B0329+54 data which is consistent with the definition of a
coherent signal. However, we model the effects due to interstellar
scintillation for this pulsar and show that it reproduces the observed
signature. In particular, the temporal coherence time is close to the
reciprocal of the decorrelation bandwidth due to diffractive scintillation.
Furthermore, comparison of the coherence times of three pulsars reported by
Jenet et al. (2001) with their expected diffractive decorrelation bandwidths
suggests that the detection of coherence in these pulsars is also likely a
result of interstellar scintillation, and is not intrinsic to the pulsars.

regions of these systems are dominated by the starburst component. At low
surface brightness levels the emission is due to the underlying host galaxy;
the latter is characterized by red, radially constant colors and isophotes well
fit by ellipses. We derive accurate optical near--infrared host galaxy colors
for eight of the sample galaxies; these colors are typical of an evolved

presence of a complex, large-scale absorption pattern in three of the sample

the limited surface brightness interval over which the fit can be made, the

analogue of carbonaceous dust, the quenched carbonaceous composite (QCC),
synthesized from a plasma gas of methane with various 12C/13C ratios. Peak
shifts to longer wavelengths due to the substitution of 12C by 13C are clearly
observed in several absorption bands. The shifts are almost linearly
proportional to the 13C fraction. New features associated with 13C are not
seen, indicating that the infrared bands in the QCC are not very localized
vibration modes but come from vibrations associated with rather large carbon
structures. An appreciable peak shift is detected in the 6.2 micron band, which
is attributed to a carbon-carbon vibration. A peak shift in an out-of-plane
bending mode of aromatic C--H at 11.4 micron is also observed, while only a
small shift is detected in the 3.3 micron band, which arises from a C--H
stretching mode. The present experiment suggests that peak shifts in the
unidentified infrared (UIR) bands, particularly in the 6.2 micron band, should
be detectable in celestial objects with low 12C/13C ratios (< 10). The isotopic
shifts seen in the QCC are discussed in relation to the variations in the UIR
band peaks observed in post-asymptotic giant branch stars and planetary
nebulae. The observed peak shift pattern of the UIR bands is qualitatively in
agreement with the isotopic shifts in the QCC except for the 7.7 micron band
complex although the observed shifts in the UIR bands are larger than those
inferred from derived isotope ratios for individual objects. The present
investigation suggests that part of the observed variations in the UIR band
peaks may come from the isotopic effects.

properties of bremsstrahlung, the dominant emission process at these
wavelengths, make it sensitive to structure and allow us to study how the
amount of structure changes in the wind by comparing the fluxes at different
wavelengths. To look for variability, we acquired 3.6 and 6 cm observations
with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We supplemented these with
archive observations from the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA). We did not find
variability at more than the +- 20 % level. The long integration time does
allow an accurate determination of the fluxes at 3.6 and 6 cm. Converting these
fluxes into a mass loss rate, we find Mdot = 3.5 x 10^{-6} Msun/yr. This value
confirms the significant discrepancy with the mass loss rate derived from the
Halpha profile, making zeta Pup an exception to the usually good agreement
between Halpha and radio mass loss rates. We also observed zeta Pup at 850 mum
with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and at 20 cm with the VLA. A
smooth wind model shows that the millimetre fluxes are too high compared to the
radio fluxes. While recombination of helium in the outer wind cannot be
discounted as an explanation, the wealth of evidence for structure strongly
suggests this as the explanation for the discrepancy. Model calculations show
that the structure needs to be present in the inner ~ 70 R* of the wind, but
that it decays significantly, or maybe even disappears, beyond that radius.

clinicians will be able to harness the use of massive amounts of medical image
data to perform epidemiological studies, advanced image processing,
radiographic education and ultimately, tele-diagnosis over communities of

in addition guarantees the integrity and security of the medical data. The

  First Joint AMS-RSME Meeting (Sevilla, june 2003)",,,,"cs.DM cs.CE q-bio",,"  The measurement of the similarity of RNA secondary structures, and in general
of contact structures, of a fixed length has several specific applications. For
instance, it is used in the analysis of the ensemble of suboptimal secondary
structures generated by a given algorithm on a given RNA sequence, and in the
comparison of the secondary structures predicted by different algorithms on a
given RNA molecule. It is also a useful tool in the quantitative study of
sequence-structure maps. A way to measure this similarity is by means of
metrics. In this paper we introduce a new class of metrics $d_{m}$, $m\geq 3$,
on the set of all contact structures of a fixed length, based on their
representation by means of edge ideals in a polynomial ring. These metrics can
be expressed in terms of Hilbert functions of monomial ideals, which allows the
use of several public domain computer algebra systems to compute them. We study
some abstract properties of these metrics, and we obtain explicit descriptions
of them for $m=3,4$ on arbitrary contact structures and for $m=5,6$ on RNA
secondary structures.

large systems comprising hundreds or thousands of classes. In this paper, we
describe a metric by which key classes, and hence candidates for refactoring,

inheritance and aggregation, together with two other class features (number of

  20th International Conference on Computer Processing of Oriental Languages,
  Shenyang, China, August 2003",,,,"cs.CL",,"  k is the most important parameter in a text categorization system based on
k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (kNN).In the classification process, k nearest
documents to the test one in the training set are determined firstly. Then, the
predication can be made according to the category distribution among these k
nearest neighbors. Generally speaking, the class distribution in the training
set is uneven. Some classes may have more samples than others. Therefore, the
system performance is very sensitive to the choice of the parameter k. And it
is very likely that a fixed k value will result in a bias on large categories.
To deal with these problems, we propose an improved kNN algorithm, which uses
different numbers of nearest neighbors for different categories, rather than a
fixed number across all categories. More samples (nearest neighbors) will be
used for deciding whether a test document should be classified to a category,
which has more samples in the training set. Preliminary experiments on Chinese
text categorization show that our method is less sensitive to the parameter k
than the traditional one, and it can properly classify documents belonging to
smaller classes with a large k. The method is promising for some cases, where
estimating the parameter k via cross-validation is not allowed.

the set of objects, $\Ob\Q$, in a (small) category $\Q$. The quantum states in
this approach are cross-sections of a bundle $A\leadsto\K[A]$ of Hilbert spaces
over $\Ob\Q$. The Hilbert spaces $\K[A]$, $A\in\Ob\Q$, depend strongly on the

paper, we develop a different approach in which the state vectors are
complex-valued functions on the set of {\em arrows} in $\Q$. This throws a new
light on the Hilbert bundle scheme: in particular, we recover the results of
that approach in the, physically important, example when $\Q$ is a small

in terms of particles. A simple thermodynamic model is presented, treating the
matter as an ideal gas of (ultrarelativistic) fermions and bosons.
  The number of ultra-relativistic particles within a holostar is proportional
its surface-area, indicating that the holographic principle is valid in
classical GR for self gravitating objects of any size. Using the grand
canonical formalism we show, that the interior temperature is given by T
\propto / \sqrt{r}. With a surface redshift z \propto \sqrt{r} the holostar's
temperature at infinity is equal to the Hawking result, up to a constant
factor. The factor depends on the number of particle degrees of freedom at the
Planck energy, which is estimated as f ~ 7000. The holostar's total
thermodynamic entropy is proportional to the area of its boundary membrane.
  The ultra-relativistic fermions in the interior space-time must acquire a
non-zero chemical potential, which acts as a natural source for a profound
matter-antimatter asymmetry at high temperatures.

classical condition M >= Q. Whereas RN solutions with M < Q are possible, a
charged holostar with Mg > Q doesn't exist.
  The total charge Q is derived by the proper integral over the interior charge

TTQ Le and the author that the colored Jones function of a knot is q-holonomic,
ie, that it satisfies a nontrivial linear recursion relation with appropriate
coefficients. Using holonomicity, we introduce a geometric invariant of a knot:
the characteristic variety, an affine 1-dimensional variety in C^2. We then
compare it with the character variety of SL_2(C) representations, viewed from
the boundary. The comparison is stated as a conjecture which we verify (by a
direct computation) in the case of the trefoil and figure eight knots.
  We also propose a geometric relation between the peripheral subgroup of the
knot group, and basic operators that act on the colored Jones function. We also
define a noncommutative version (the so-called noncommutative A-polynomial) of
the characteristic variety of a knot.
  Holonomicity works well for higher rank groups and goes beyond hyperbolic
geometry, as we explain in the last chapter.

  beam from accelerators","Presented at PAC 2003 (Portland, May 12-16)","Conf.Proc.C030512:1655,2003",,,"physics.acc-ph physics.ins-det",,"  The design and performance of a novel crystal deflector for proton beams are
reported. A silicon crystal was used to channel and extract 70 GeV protons from
the U-70 accelerator in Protvino with an efficiency of 85%, as measured for a
beam of ~1e12 protons directed towards crystals of ~2 mm length in spills of ~2
s duration. Experimental data agree with the theoretically predicted Monte
Carlo results for channeling. The technique allows one to manufacture a very
short deflector along the beam direction (2 mm). Consequently, multiple
encounters of circulating particles with the crystal are possible with little
probability of multiple scattering and nuclear interactions per encounter.
Thus, drastic increase in efficiency for particle extraction out of the
accelerator was attained. We show the characteristics of the crystal- deflector
and the technology behind it. Such an achievement is important in devising a
more efficient use of the U-70 accelerator and provides crucial support for
implementing crystal-assisted slow extraction and collimation in other
machines, such as the Tevatron, RHIC, the AGS, the SNS, COSY, and the LHC.

a complete OO/C++ environment. In this framework the simulation of the various
test beams for the different ATLAS subdetectors offers an excellent opportunity
to perform physics validation studies over a wide range of physics domains: the
electromagnetic processes, the individual hadronic interactions, the
electromagnetic and hadronic signals in calorimeters. The simulation is
implemented by paying special attention to all details of the experimental
layout and by testing all possible physics processes which may be of relevance
to the specific detector under test: the resulting simulation programs are
often more detailed than the corresponding Geant3-based simulation suites. In
this paper we present relevant features of muon, electron and pion signals in
various ATLAS detectors. All remaining discrepancies between Geant4 and
test-beam data are currently being addressed and progress is continuous. This
work shows that Geant4 is becoming a mature and useful product for simulating
specific features of large-scale detector systems.

CHSH inequality for two-dimension. This inequality is optimal in the same sense
as the CHSH inequality for two dimensional systems, namely, the maximal amount
by which the inequality is violated consists with the maximal resistance to
noise. We also discuss the physical meaning and general definition of the
correlation functions. Furthermore, by giving another specific set of the
correlation functions with the same physical meaning, we realize the inequality
presented in [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 88,}040404 (2002)].

This arises essentially from relativistic quantum dynamics, but persists even

technique which uses cyclic adiabatic reversals of spins. The interaction of
the cantilever with the environment is shown to quickly destroy the coherence
between the two possible cantilever trajectories. We have shown that using
partial adiabatic reversals, one can produce a significant increase in the

most natural way: one post-selects those photons that have not been lost
because of the PDL. The quantum formalism is shown to simplify the calculation
of optical networks in the telecom limit of weak PMD.

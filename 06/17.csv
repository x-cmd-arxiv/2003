high-redshift radio galaxy 4C 41.17 (z=3.8). Our 150-ks Chandra exposure
detects strong X-ray emission from a point source coincident with the nucleus
of the radio galaxy. In addition we identify extended X-ray emission with a
luminosity ~1e45 erg/s covering a 100kpc (15'') diameter region around the
radio galaxy. The extended X-ray emission follows the general distribution of
radio emission in the radio lobes of this source, and the distribution of a
giant Lyman-alpha emission line halo, while the spectrum of the X-ray emission
is non-thermal and has a power law index consistent with that of the radio
synchrotron. We conclude that the X-ray emission is most likely Inverse-Compton
scattering of far-infrared photons from a relativistic electron population
probably associated with past and current activity from the central object.
Assuming an equipartition magnetic field the CMB energy density at z=3.8 can
only account for at most 40% of the Inverse-Compton emission. Published
submillimeter maps of 4C 41.17 have detected an apparently extended and
extremely luminous far-infrared emission around the radio galaxy. We
demonstrate that this photon component and its spatial distribution, in
combination with the CMB can reproduce the observed X-ray luminosity. We
propose that photo-ionization by these Inverse-Compton X-ray photons plays a
significant role in this system, and provides a new physical feedback mechanism
to preferentially affect the gas within the most massive halos at high
redshift. This is the highest redshift example of extended X-ray emission
around a radio galaxy currently known. (Abridged)

causes: (1) deuterium burning in the most massive substellar objects; (2)
methane absorption in bodies with $T_{eff}$ less than 1300 K, the temperature
of the L/T transition; and (3) the formation of dust clouds and the rainout of
dust at roughly the same effective temperature as methane formation. Accurate
reconstruction of the substellar mass function from luminosity function
observations requires that these phenomena are taken into account. At present,
few observational studies extend to sufficient sensitivities to allow detection
of these effects. However, the luminosity function of the young open cluster IC
2391 shows a clear peak at $M_I \sim 14$ which we attribute to the result of
deuterium burning in substellar objects. The location of this feature is a
strong function of age, and we estimate an age of 35 Myr for IC 2391. This is
significantly younger than the 53 Myr derived from the location of the lithium
depletion boundary but agrees with the main sequence turnoff age. We consider
the implications of this result and our multi-band luminosity functions for

$P=(80\pm 20)%$, in the prompt gamma-ray emission of GRB 021206, supports
synchrotron emission as being the dominant radiation mechanism. There were also
claims that this implies a magnetic field ordered on large scales within the
ejecta, that must therefore be produced at the source, which in turn was used
as an argument in favor magnetic fields playing an active role in the
production of GRB jets. However, an alternative explanation was suggested which
also works with a magnetic field that is generated in the internal shocks and
does not originate at the source: a very narrow jet, of opening angle
$\theta_j\sim 1/\gamma$, where $\gamma\gtrsim 100$ is the Lorentz factor during
the GRB, viewed at $\theta_j<\theta_{obs}\lesssim\theta_j+1/\gamma$. We
calculate $P$ for these two scenarios, and find that it is significantly easier
to produce $P\gtrsim 50%$ with an ordered field. More specifically, we obtain
$P\sim(43-61)%$ for an ordered transverse magnetic field, $B_{ord}$, whereas a
random field within the plane of the shock, $B_\perp$, produces
$P\lesssim(38-54)%$ for a single pulse in the GRB light curve, but the
integrated emission over many pulses (as measured in GRB 021206) is a factor of
$\sim 2$ lower. A magnetic field normal to the shock front, $B_\parallel$,
produces $P\sim(35-62)%$ for the emission integrated over many pulses. However,
polarization measurements from GRB afterglows suggest a more isotropic
shock-produced field configuration that would reduce $P$ by a factor $\sim
2-3$. Therefore, an ordered magnetic field, $B_{ord}$, that originates at the
source, can produce the observed polarization most naturally, while
$B_\parallel$ is less likely, and $B_\perp$ is the least likely of the above.

Four unperturbed potentials V_0(r) were considered, namely the Plummer
potential and Dehnen potentials with \gamma=0.0, 0.5, and 1.0, each subjected
to a time-dependence of the form V(r,t)=V_0(r)(1+m_0\sin(\omega t)). In each
case, the orbits divide clearly into regular and chaotic, distinctions which
appear absolute. In particular, transitions from regularity to chaos are
seemingly impossible. Over finite time intervals, chaotic orbits subdivide into
what can be termed `sticky' chaotic orbits, which exhibit no large scale
secular changes in energy and remain trapped in the phase space region where
they started; and `wildly chaotic' orbits, which do exhibit systematic drifts
in energy as the orbits diffuse to inhabit different phase space regions. This
latter distinction is not absolute, apparently corresponding instead to orbits
penetrating a `leaky' phase space barrier. The three different orbit types can
be identified simply in terms of the frequencies for which their Fourier
spectra have the most power. An examination of the statistical properties of
orbit ensembles as a function of driving frequency \omega allows one to
identify the specific resonances that determine orbital structure. Attention
focuses also on how, for fixed amplitude m_0, such quantities as the mean
energy shift, the relative measure of chaotic orbits, and the mean value of the
largest Lyapunov exponent vary with driving frequency \omega and how, for fixed
\omega, the same quantities depend on m_0.

edge must be part of some circle on the sphere (but not necessarily a great
circle), and (ii) that the weight within each subregion of the mask must be

angular regions bounded by arbitrary numbers of edges. The polygons may be
regarded as the `pixels' of a mask, with the feature that the pixels are
allowed to take a rather general shape, rather than following some predefined
regular pattern. Among other things, the scheme includes facilities to compute
the spherical harmonics of the angular mask, and Data-Random <DR> and

which corresponds to intergranular lanes. The large surface covered by signal
renders a mean unsigned magnetic flux density between 17G and 21G (1G \equiv
1Mx cm$^{-2}$). The difference depends on the spectral line used to generate
the magnetograms (Fe I 6302 or Fe I 6301). Such systematic difference can be
understood if the magnetic structures producing the polarization have intrinsic
field strengths exceeding 1 kG, and consequently, occupying only a very small
fraction of the surface (some 2%). We observe both, magnetic signals changing
in time scales smaller than 1 min, and a persistent pattern lasting longer than
the duration of the sequence (17 min). The pattern resembles a network with a
spatial scale between 5 and 10 arcsec, which we identify as the
mesogranulation. The strong dependence of the polarization signals on spatial
resolution and sensitivity suggests that much quiet Sun magnetic flux still
remains undetected.

analyzed for observational properties of visual binary stars, both in a general
context without taking any observational constraints into account, and using
different observability criteria that model the observational capability of the
astrometric DIVA satellite. It is shown that several observational bias effects
should be taken into account when final output catalogues are analyzed. The
results indicate that $\Delta m_v$ distribution peaks at $\Delta m_v \approx 7$

magnitude threshold should be set as high as possible. This is especially
important if low mass $M<0.2 M_{\sun}$ secondaries are studied. The predicted

based on the condition that the surface gravities as determined by the Fe I/Fe
II ionization equilibria are in agreement with their astrometric counterparts
obtained from HIPPARCOS parallaxes. Depending on the choice of the hydrogen
collision scaling factor S_H, we find deviations from LTE in Fe I ranging from
0.00 (S_H = infinity) to 0.46 dex (S_H = 0 for HD140283) in the logarithmic
abundances while Fe II follows LTE.
  With the exception of Procyon, for which a mild temperature correction is
needed to fulfil the ionization balance, excellent consistency is obtained for
the metal-poor reference stars if Balmer profile temperatures are combined with
S_H = 3. The correct choice of collisional damping parameters (""van-der-Waals""
constants) is found to be generally more important for these little evolved
metal-poor stars than considering departures from LTE. For the Sun the
calibrated value for S_H leads to average Fe I non-LTE corrections of 0.02 dex
and a mean abundance from Fe I lines of log epsilon(Fe) = 7.49 \pm 0.08.
  We confront the deduced stellar parameters with comparable spectroscopic
analyses by other authors which also rely on the iron ionization equilibrium as
a gravity indicator. On the basis of the HIPPARCOS astrometry our results are

Ark 564 is used to investigate, for the first time, the physical conditions and

The emission-line spectrum of Ark 564, which ranges from the ultraviolet to the
near-infrared, shows a rich forbidden line spectrum. Strong emphasis is given
to the study of the coronal line region. The diversity of physical conditions
deduced from the observations requires multi-cloud models to reproduce the
observed lines and continuum. We find that a combination of high velocity (Vs =
1500 km/s) shock-dominated clouds as well as low velocity (Vs = 150 km/s)
radiation-dominated clouds explains the coronal lines, while the optical
low-ionization lines are mainly explained by shock-dominated clouds. The
results for Ark 564 are compared with those obtained for other Seyfert galaxies
previously analyzed such as NGC 5252, Circinus, NGC 4051 and NGC 4151. The
model results for the ultraviolet and optical permitted lines suggest that the
broad line region may contribute up to 80%, depending on the emission-line,
being of about 30% for Hbeta. The consistency of the multi-cloud model is
checked by comparing the predicted and observed continuum, from radio to X-ray,
and indicate that the dust-to-gas ratio in the clouds varies from 10^{-15} to

indicating that there is more inner structure than just a nucleus. In addition,
we find a relation between the effective surface brightness, at a given

have stronger isophotal twists. In sum, our findings suggest the presence of

transport, and a non-monotonic magnetic field dependence both in the singlet
and the triplet regime. For a generic set of dot parameters and no Zeeman
splitting, the singlet-triplet transition may be identified with the
conductance maximum. The conductance is least sensitive to the magnetic field
in the region of the transition, where it decreases upon application of a
magnetic field. Our results are in good agreement with recent experimental

solids. In weak magnetic fields (at high Landau levels) solids with many
particles per unit cell - bubble phases - predominate. In strong magnetic

is facilitated by the fact that even a weak disorder influences their dc and ac
magnetotransport in a very specific way. In the ac domain, a range of
frequencies appears where the electromagnetic response is dominated by
magnetophonon collective modes. The effect of disorder is to localize the
collective modes and to create an inhomogeneously broadened absorption line,
the pinning mode. In recent microwave experiments pinning modes have been
discovered both at the lowest and at high Landau levels. We present the theory

to the cyclotron energy and is therefore treated as a perturbation. Two
competing many-body effects, the shakeup of the electron gas in the optical
transition, and the excitonic effect, contribute to the shakeup satellite
intensities. It is shown, that the range of the hole potential essentially
influences the shakeup spectrum. For a short range interaction the above
mentioned competition is more important and results in the shakeup emission
quenching when electrons occupy only the lowest Landau level. When more than
one Landau level is filled, the intensities of the shakeup satellites change
with magnetic field nonmonotonically. If the interaction is long range, the
Fermi sea shakeup processes dominate. Then, the satellite intensities smoothly
decrease when the magnetic field increases and there is no suppression of the
shakeup spectrum when the only lowest Landau level is filled. It is shown also
that a strong hole localization is not a necessary condition for the SU

amelioration of the Automatic Script Compiler and the incorporation of new

modularity of the ROOT system with the introduction of more abstract interfaces
and the development of a plug-in manager. In the near future, we intend to
continue the development of PROOF and its interfacing with GRID environments.
We plan on providing an interface between Geant3, Geant4 and Fluka and the new

we plan to release a GUI inspector and builder. In the last year, ROOT has
drawn the endorsement of additional experiments and institutions. It is now

using small memory and with essentially no slowdown in forward steps. Using
$O(\log n)$ memory for a list of size $n$, the $i$'th back-step from the
farthest point reached so far takes $O(\log i)$ time in the worst case, while
the overhead per forward step is at most $\epsilon$ for arbitrary small
constant $\epsilon>0$. An arbitrary sequence of forward and back steps is
allowed. A full trade-off between memory usage and time per back-step is
presented: $k$ vs. $kn^{1/k}$ and vice versa. Our algorithms are based on a
novel pebbling technique which moves pebbles on a virtual binary, or $t$-ary,
tree that can only be traversed in a pre-order fashion. The compact data
structures used by the pebbling algorithms, called list traversal synopses,
extend to general directed graphs, and have other interesting applications,
including memory efficient hash-chain implementation. Perhaps the most
surprising application is in showing that for any program, arbitrary rollback
steps can be efficiently supported with small overhead in memory, and marginal
overhead in its ordinary execution. More concretely: Let $P$ be a program that
runs for at most $T$ steps, using memory of size $M$. Then, at the cost of
recording the input used by the program, and increasing the memory by a factor
of $O(\log T)$ to $O(M \log T)$, the program $P$ can be extended to support an
arbitrary sequence of forward execution and rollback steps: the $i$'th rollback
step takes $O(\log i)$ time in the worst case, while forward steps take O(1)
time in the worst case, and $1+\epsilon$ amortized time per step.

only one faceted (e.g., cubical) proof mass per spacecraft, intra-spacecraft
laser metrology needed only at the central spacecraft, placement in a single
appropriate orbit can reduce Doppler drifts so that no laser beam modulation is
required for ultra-stable oscillator noise calibration, and little or no
time-dependent articulation of the telescopes to maintain pointing. Because
SyZyGy's sensitivity falls off more sharply at low frequency than that of an

mHz-.1 Hz). A SyZyGy with ~1 light- second scale could, for the same

this allows a well-controlled extrapolation to the continuum limit. When the
resulting spectrum is presented in the form of a Chew-Frautschi plot we find
that we can draw a straight Regge trajectory going through the lightest
glueballs of spin 0, 2, 4 and 6. The slope of this trajectory is small and
turns out to lie between the predictions of the adjoint-string and flux-tube
glueball models. The intercept we find, \alpha_0 ~ -1, is much lower than is
needed for this leading trajectory to play a `Pomeron-like' role of the kind it
is often believed to play in D=3+1. We elaborate the Regge theory of high
energy scattering in 2 space dimensions, and we conclude, from the observed low
intercept, that high-energy glueball scattering is not dominated by the leading
Regge pole exchange, but rather by a more complex singularity structure in the
region 0 <= Re{\lambda} <= 1/2 of the complex angular momentum \lambda plane.
We show that these conclusions do not change if we go to larger groups,
SU(N>2), and indeed to SU(\infty), and we contrast all this with our very
preliminary calculations in the D=3+1 SU(3) gauge theory.

limit of a quantum theory of gravity must be a theory invariant, not under the
Poincare group, but under a deformation of it parameterized by a dimensional
parameter proportional to the Planck mass. Such deformations, called
kappa-Poincare algebras, imply modified energy-momentum relations of a type
that may be observable in near future experiments. Our argument applies in both
2+1 and 3+1 dimensions and assumes only 1) that the low energy limit of a
quantum theory of gravity must involve also a limit in which the cosmological
constant is taken very small with respect to the Planck scale and 2) that in
3+1 dimensions the physical energy and momenta of physical elementary particles
is related to symmetries of the full quantum gravity theory by appropriate
renormalization depending on Lambda l^2_{Planck}. The argument makes use of the
fact that the cosmological constant results in the symmetry algebra of quantum
gravity being quantum deformed, as a consequence when the limit \Lambda
l^2_{Planck} -> 0 is taken one finds a deformed Poincare invariance. We are
also able to isolate what information must be provided by the quantum theory in
order to determine which presentation of the kappa-Poincare algebra is relevant
for the physical symmetry generators and, hence, the exact form of the modified
energy-momentum relations. These arguments imply that Lorentz invariance is
modified as in proposals for doubly special relativity, rather than broken, in
theories of quantum gravity, so long as those theories behave smoothly in the
limit the cosmological constant is taken to be small.

with rotation and four-form magnetic flux. It is known that, as seen in
inertial frame of co-moving observer, all geodesics with zero orbital angular
momentum orbit inside `surface of light velocity' (CTC horizon). To learn if
other probes can travel beyond the CTC horizon, we study dynamics of M-graviton
and, in particular, M2-brane, whose motion is affected by Lorentz force exerted
by the four-form magnetic flux and by nonzero orbital angular momentum.
Classically, we find that both probes gyrate closed orbits, but diameter and
center of gyration depends on sign and magnitude of probe's energy, charge and
orbital angular momentum. For M2-brane, orbits in general travel outside the
CTC horizon. Quantum-mechanically, we find that wave function and excitation
energy levels are all self-similar. We draw analogy of probe's dynamics with
Landau problem for charged particle in magnetic field.

branes within a higher dimensional spacetime, leading to the production of a
large amount of entropy. In this paper we study, subject to certain
well-defined assumptions, under what conditions such a collision leads to an
expanding universe. We assume the absence of novel physics, so that ordinary
(4+1) -dimensional Einstein gravity remains a valid approximation. It is
necessary that the fifth dimension not become degenerate at the moment of
collision. First the case of a symmetric collision of infinitely thin branes
having a hyperbolic or flat spatial geometry is considered. We find that a
symmetric collision results in a collapsing universe on the final brane unless
the pre-existing expansion rate in the bulk just prior to the collision is
sufficiently large in comparison to the momentum transfer in the fifth
dimension. Such prior expansion may either result from negative spatial
curvature or from a positive five-dimensional cosmological constant. The
relevance of these findings to the Colliding Bubble Braneworld Universe
scenario is discussed. Finally, results from a numerical study of colliding
thick-wall branes is presented, which confirm the results of the thin-wall
approximation.

of both the attractant and the repellent. Aerotaxis occurs without methylation
adaptation, and it leads to fast and complete aggregation toward the most
favorable oxygen concentration. Biochemical pathways of aerotaxis remain
largely elusive, however, aerotactic pattern formation is well documented. This
allows mathematical modeling to test plausible hypotheses about the biochemical
mechanisms. Our model demonstrates that assuming fast, non-methylation
adaptation produces theoretical results that are consistent with experimental
observations. We obtain analytical estimates for parameter values that are
difficult to obtain experimentally.
  Chemotaxis in growth cones differs from gradient sensing in other animal
cells, because growth cones can change their attractive or repulsive response
to the same chemical gradient based on their internal calcium or cAMP levels.
We create two models describing different aspects of growth cone guidance. One
model describes the internal switch that determines the direction of movement.
However, this model allows chemotaxis under certain conditions only, so a
second model is created to propose a mechanism that allows growth cone guidance
in any environment.
  Endothelial cells go through extensive morphological changes when exposed to
shear stress due to blood flow. These morphological changes are thought to be
at least partially the result of mechanical signals, such as deformations,
transmitted to the cell structures. Our model describes an endothelial cell as
a network of viscoelastic Kelvin bodies with experimentally obtained
parameters. Qualitative predictions of the model agree with experiments.

we prove in this case the monodromy conjecture made by Denef-Loeser for the

two-dimensional biological group under the influence of nonlocal social
interactions. The dynamics may be uniquely decomposed into incompressible
motion and potential motion. When the motion is purely incompressible, the
model possesses solutions which have constant population density and sharp
boundaries for all time. Numerical simulations of these ""swarm patches'' reveal
rotating mill-like swarms with circular cores and spiral arms. The sign of the
social interaction term determines the direction of the rotation, and the
interaction length scale affects the degree of spiral formation. When the
motion is purely potential, the social interaction term has the meaning of
repulsion or attraction depending on its sign. For the repulsive case, the
population spreads and the density profile is smoothed. With increasing
interaction length scale, the motion becomes more convective and experiences
slower diffusive smoothing. For the attractive case, the population
self-organizes into regions of high and low density. The characteristic length
scale of the density pattern is predicted and confirmed by numerical
simulations.

level displacement of the ground state of pionic hydrogen contain the
non-perturbative and model-independent correction about 1%, caused by the
relativistic covariant smearing of the wave function of the ground state around
origin. This non-perturbative correction is very important for the precise
extraction of the S-wave scattering lengths of pion-nucleon scattering from the
experimental data on the energy level displacements in pionic hydrogen by the
PSI Collaboration. In addition the shift of the energy level of the ground
state of pionic hydrogen is improved by the second order correction of strong
low-energy interactions which is about 0.1%. This testifies the applicability
of the perturbative treatment of strong low-energy interactions to the analysis
of pionic hydrogen. We show that the width of the energy level of the ground

state multiplicity was discovered in the autohumidification PEM fuel cell,
resulting from a balance between water production and water removal. Ignition
was observed in the PEM fuel cell for a critical water activity of about 0.1.
Ignition is a consequence of the exponential increase of proton conductivity
with water activity, which creates an autocatalytic feedback between the water
production and the proton conduction. The steady state current in the ignited
state decreases with increasing temperature between 50 to 105 deg C. At
temperatures greater than 70 deg C five steady states were observed in the PEM
fuel cell. The steady state performance has been followed with variable load
resistance and hysteresis loops have been mapped. The dynamics of transitions
between steady states are slow about 10^3 to 10^4 s. These slow dynamics are

structures. A photonic crystal is a dielectric structure arranged in a periodic
geometry. Like a crystalline solid with its electronic band structure, the
modes of a photonic crystal lie in a set of allowed photonic bands. Similarly,
it is possible for a photonic crystal to exhibit one or more photonic band
gaps, with frequencies in the gap unable to propagate in the crystal. Thus
photonic crystals can confine an optical mode in an all-dielectric structure,
eliminating the need for metals and their characteristic losses at optical
frequencies.
  We discuss several geometries of photonic crystal accelerator structures.
Photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) are optical fibers which can confine a
speed-of-light optical mode in vacuum. Planar structures, both two- and
three-dimensional, can also confine such a mode, and have the additional
advantage that they can be manufactured using common microfabrication
techniques such as those used for integrated circuits. This allows for a
variety of possible materials, so that dielectrics with desirable optical and
radiation-hardness properties can be chosen. We discuss examples of simulated
photonic crystal structures to demonstrate the scaling laws and trade-offs
involved, and touch on potential fabrication processes.

wave is investigated with a semi-classical numerical model. The results of a
calculation including the velocity dependence of the dipole force are compared
with those of the commonly used approach, which assumes a conservative dipole
force. The comparison is made for two atom guiding regimes that can be used for
the production of nanostructure arrays; a low power regime, where the atoms are
focused in a standing wave by the dipole force, and a higher power regime, in
which the atoms channel along the potential minima of the light field. In the
low power regime the differences between the two models are negligible and both
models show that, for lithography purposes, pattern widths of 150 nm can be
achieved. In the high power channelling regime the conservative force model,
predicting 100 nm features, is shown to break down. The model that incorporates
velocity dependence, resulting in a structure size of 40 nm, remains valid, as
demonstrated by a comparison with quantum Monte-Carlo wavefunction
calculations.

  Nuclear Physics (CHEP03), La Jolla, Ca, USA, March 2003, PSN THLT002",,,,"physics.data-an physics.ins-det",,"  In this paper lossless and a quasi lossless algorithms for the online
compression of the data generated by the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) detector
of the ALICE experiment at CERN are described. The first algorithm is based on
a lossless source code modelling technique, i.e. the original TPC signal
information can be reconstructed without errors at the decompression stage. The
source model exploits the temporal correlation that is present in the TPC data
to reduce the entropy of the source. The second algorithm is based on a lossy
source code modelling technique. In order to evaluate the consequences of the
error introduced by the lossy compression, the results of the trajectory
tracking algorithms that process data offline are analyzed, in particular, with
respect to the noise introduced by the compression. The offline analysis has
two steps: cluster finder and track finder. The results on how these algorithms
are affected by the lossy compression are reported. In both compression
technique entropy coding is applied to the set of events defined by the source
model to reduce the bit rate to the corresponding source entropy. Using TPC
simulated data, the lossless and the lossy compression achieve a data reduction
to 49.2% of the original data rate and respectively in the range of 35% down to
30% depending on the desired precision.In this study we have focused on methods
which are easy to implement in the frontend TPC electronics.

entanglement for two qubits is investigated. The relationship between base and
fiber i.e. the twisting of the bundle corresponds to the entanglement of the
qubits. The measure of entanglement can be related to the length of the
shortest geodesic with respect to the Mannoury-Fubini-Study metric on ${\bf
HP}^1$ between an arbitrary entangled state, and the separable state nearest to
it. Using this result an interpretation of the standard Schmidt decomposition
in geometric terms is given. Schmidt states are the nearest and furthest
separable ones lying on, or the ones obtained by parallel transport along the
geodesic passing through the entangled state. Some examples showing the
correspondence between the anolonomy of the connection and entanglement via the
geometric phase is shown. Connections with important notions like the
Bures-metric, Uhlmann's connection, the hyperbolic structure for density
matrices and anholonomic quantum computation are also pointed out.

and report evidence of a soft, diffuse X-ray component. The emission is peaked
in the cluster center and is detected out to 8' from the X-ray center. Fitting
a thermal model to the combined BeppoSax and PSPC spectra show excess emission
below 1 keV in the PSPC and above 100 keV in the BeppoSax PDS. The source 26W20
is in the field of view of the PDS. The addition of a powerlaw with the
spectral parameters measured by Silverman et al. (1998) for 26W20 successfully
models the hard component in the PDS. The remaining excess soft emission can be
modeled by either a low temperature, 0.75 - 1.03 keV component, or by a
powerlaw with a steep spectral index, 2.3. Addition of a second thermal
component model provides a much better fit to the data than does the addition
of a non-thermal component. The Chandra temperature map does not show any
region cooler than 6.9 keV within the region where the cool component was
detected. Simulations of the emission from embedded groups were performed and
compared with the Chandra temperature map which show groups are a plausible
source of ~1 keV emission. The cool component is centrally peaked in the
cluster and the gas density and temperature are relatively high arguing against
the WHIM as the source of the X-ray emission. X-ray emission from elliptical
galaxies is not high enough to provide the total cool component luminosity,
7.0x10^43 ergs s^-1. The peak of the cool component is located between the low
frequency radio halos arguing against a non-thermal interpretation for the
emission. We conclude that emission from embedded groups is the most likely
origin of the cool component in Abell 754.

properties of galaxies in the cores of rich clusters. We have focused on the
overall picture: star formation in clusters is strongly suppressed relative to
field galaxies at the same redshift. We will argue that the increasing activity
and blue populations of clusters with redshift results from a greater level of
activity in field galaxies rather than a change in the transformation imposed
by the cluster environment. With this in mind, we travel out from the cluster
focussing firstly on the properties of galaxies in the outskirts of clusters
and then on galaxies in isolated groups. At low redshift, we are able to
efficiently probe these environments using the Sloan and 2DF redshift surveys.
These allow an accurate comparison of galaxy star formation rates in different
regions. The current results show a strong suppression of star formation above
a critical threshold in local density. The threshold seems similar regardless
of the overall mass of the system. At low redshift at least, only galaxies in
close, isolated pairs have their star formation rate boosted above the global
average. At higher redshift, work on constructing homogeneous catalogues of
galaxies in groups and in the infall regions of clusters is still at an early
stage. In the final section, we draw these strands together, summarising what
we can deduce about the mechanisms that transform star forming field galaxies
into their quiescent cluster counter-parts. We discuss what we can learn about
the impact of environment on the global star formation history of the universe.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)--the most brilliant of all astronomical
explosions--signal the collapse of massive stars in our Universe. This evidence
was originally based on the probable association of one unusual GRB with a
supernova, but now includes the association of GRBs with regions of massive
star formation in distant galaxies, the appearance of supernova-like 'bumps' in
the optical afterglow light curves of several bursts and lines of freshly
synthesized elements in the spectra of a few X-ray afterglows. These
observations support, but do not yet conclusively demonstrate, the idea that
long-duration GRBs are associated with the deaths of massive stars, presumably
arising from core collapse. Here we report evidence that a very energetic
supernova (a hypernova) was temporally and spatially coincident with a GRB at
redshift z = 0.1685. The timing of the supernova indicates that it exploded
within a few days of the GRB, strongly suggesting that core-collapse events can
give rise to GRBs, thereby favouring the 'collapsar' model.

immediately in front and behind the cluster. This is surprising, given that the
previously surveyed $z=0.41$ cluster Abell 851 has 3-4 times the field

improved by factors of 2 - 330 and as the analysis has improved from spherical,
isotropic models to axisymmetric, three-integral models. This gives us
confidence that the masses are reliable and that the galaxies do not indulge in
a wide variety of perverse orbital structures. Constraints on BH alternatives
are also improving. In M31, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectroscopy shows
that the central massive dark object (MDO) is in a tiny cluster of blue stars
embedded in the P2 nucleus of the galaxy. The MDO must be less than about 0.06
arcsec in radius. M31 becomes the third galaxy in which dark clusters of brown
dwarf stars or stellar remnants can be excluded. In our Galaxy, observations of
almost-complete stellar orbits show that the MDO radius is less than about
0.0006 pc. Among BH alternatives, this excludes even neutrino balls. Therefore,
measurements of central dark masses and the conclusion that these are BHs have
both stood the test of time. Confidence in the BH paradigm for active galactic
nuclei is correspondingly high. Compared to the radius of the BH sphere of
influence, BHs are discovered at similar spatial resolution with HST as in
ground-based work. The reason is that HST is used to observe more distant
galaxies. Large, unbiased samples are accessible. As a result, HST has
revolutionized the study of BH demographics.

and metal-abundance. The synthesis models are based on those of Worthey (1994,
ApJS, 95, 107), when coupled with the combination of an empirical library of
stellar spectra (Jones 1999, PhD thesis, University of North Carolina) for the
cooler stars and synthetic spectra, generated from Kurucz model atmospheres,
for the hotters stars. Overall, we find good agreement between the ages of the
MC clusters derived from our integrated spectra (and the evolutionary synthesis
modelling of the spectral indices) and ages derived from analyses of the
cluster color-magnitude diagrams, as found in the literature. Hence the
principal conclusion of this study is that ages of young stellar populations
can be reliably measured from modelling of their integrated spectra.

dispersion, late-type VLG dominated systems appear to be the analogous of our

with mass comparable to rich groups or clusters, as suggested by the comparable

Alloying is achieved during film growth (possible at elevated temperature) by
the repeated sequential deposition of sub-monolayer amounts. Our approach
overcomes serious shortcomings in previous in-situ implementations of CCS based

compositional spread and the differing deposition energetics as function of
position. While moving-shutter techniques are appropriate for PLD-approaches
yielding complete spreads on small substrates (i.e. small as compared to
distances over which the deposition parameters in PLD vary, typically about 1
cm), our method can be used to fabricate samples that are large enough for
individual compositions to be analyzed by conventional techniques, including
temperature-dependent measurements of resistivity and dielectric and magnetic

temperature, T_c, of the organic molecular crystals kappa-ET_2X and beta-ET_2X
(where ET is bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene and X is an anion eg I_3).
The Abrikosov-Gorkov (AG) formula describes the suppression of T_c both by
magnetic impurities in singlet superconductors, including s-wave
superconductors and by non-magnetic impurities in a non-s-wave superconductor.
We show that various sources of disorder lead to the suppression of T_c as
described by the AG formula. This is confirmed by the excellent fit to the
data, the fact that these materials are in the clean limit and the excellent
agreement between the value of the interlayer hopping integral, t_perp,
calculated from this fit and the value of t_perp found from angular-dependant
magnetoresistance and quantum oscillation experiments. If the disorder is, as
seems most likely, non-magnetic then the pairing state cannot be s-wave. We
show that the cooling rate dependence of the magnetisation is inconsistent with
paramagnetic impurities. Triplet pairing is ruled out by several experiments.
If the disorder is non-magnetic then this implies that l>=2, in which case
Occam's razor suggests that d-wave pairing is realised. Given the proximity of
these materials to an antiferromagnetic Mott transition, it is possible that
the disorder leads to the formation of local magnetic moments via some novel
mechanism. Thus we conclude that either kappa-ET_2X and beta-ET_2X are d-wave
superconductors or else they display a novel mechanism for the formation of
localised moments. We suggest systematic experiments to differentiate between
these scenarios.

transition from a fluid to a gel. The shear viscosity diverges at the gel point
according to $\eta(p)\sim (p_c-p)^{-s}$ with $s\approx 0.65$. The diffusion
constant shows a remarkable dependence on the mass of the clusters: $D(m,p)\sim
m^{-0.69}$, not only at $p_c$ but well into the liquid phase. We also find that
the Stokes-Einstein relation $D\eta\propto k_BT$ breaks down already quite far
from the gel point.

Strand spaces have some similarities to a formalism used successfully to model

difference is the handling of agents, which are unspecified in strand spaces
and explicit in multi-agent systems. We provide a family of translations from
strand spaces to multi-agent systems parameterized by the choice of agents in
the strand space. We also show that not every multi-agent system of interest
can be expressed as a strand space. This reveals a lack of expressiveness in
the strand-space framework that can be characterized by our translation. To
highlight this lack of expressiveness, we show one simple way in which strand

of it will be a direct confirmation of the existence of a black hole. Assuming
that the ringdown waves are dominated by the fundamental mode with least
imaginary part, we consider matched filtering and develop an optimal method to
search for the ringdown waves that have damped sinusoidal wave forms.
  When we use the matched filtering method, the data analysis with a lot of
templates required. Here we have to ensure a proper match between the filter as
a template and the real wave. It is necessary to keep the detection efficiency
as high as possible under limited computational costs.
  First, we consider the white noise case for which the matched filtering can
be studied analytically. We construct an efficient method for tiling the
template space. Then, using a fitting curve of the TAMA300 DT6 noise spectrum,
we numerically consider the case of colored noise. We find our tiling method

gravitationally coupled to a background spacetime. In our first example, we
study the propagation of a qubit in flat spacetime whose metric is subject to
flat quantum fluctuations with a Gaussian spectrum. We find that these
fluctuations cause two changes in the state of the qubit: they lead to a phase
drift, as well as the expected exponential suppression (decoherence) of the
off-diagonal terms in the density matrix. Secondly, we calculate the
decoherence of a qubit in a circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole.
The no-hair theorems suggest a quantum state for the metric in which the black
hole's mass fluctuates with a thermal spectrum at the Hawking temperature.
Again, we find that the orbiting qubit undergoes decoherence and a phase drift
that both depend on the temperature of the black hole. Thirdly, we study the
interaction of coherent and squeezed gravitational waves with a qubit in
uniform motion. Finally, we investigate the decoherence of an accelerating
qubit in Minkowski spacetime due to the Unruh effect. In this case decoherence
is not due to fluctuations in the metric, but instead is caused by coupling
(which we model with a standard Hamiltonian) between the qubit and the thermal
cloud of Unruh particles bathing it. When the accelerating qubit is entangled
with a stationary partner, the decoherence should induce a corresponding loss
in teleportation fidelity.

leading order color-octet mechanisms predict an enhancement of the cross
section for J/psi with maximal energy that is not observed in the data.
However, in this region of phase space large perturbative corrections (Sudakov
logarithms) as well as enhanced nonperturbative effects are important. In this
paper we use the newly developed Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) to
systematically include these effects. We find that these corrections
significantly broaden the color-octet contribution to the J/psi spectrum. Our
calculation employs a one-stage renormalization group evolution rather than the
two-stage evolution used in previous SCET calculations. We give a simple
argument for why the two methods yield identical results to lowest order in the

Type II Berkovits' superstring to an N=2 curved background and requiring that
the sigma-model has superconformal invariance at tree-level. We compute this in
a manifestly 4D N=2 supersymmetric way. The constraints break the target
conformal and SU(2) invariances and the dilaton will be a conformal,
$SU(2)\times U(1)$ compensator. For Type II superstring in four dimensions,
worldsheet supersymmetry requires two different compensators. One type is
described by chiral and anti-chiral superfields. This compensator can be
identified with a vector multiplet. The other Type II compensator is described
by twist-chiral and twist-anti-chiral superfields and can be identified with a
tensor hypermultiplet. Also, the superconformal invariance at tree-level
selects a particular gauge, where the matter is fixed, but not the
compensators. After imposing the reality conditions, we show that the Type II
sigma model at tree-level is consistent with the equations of motion for Type
II supergravity in the string gauge.

operators on the two disjoint asymptotic boundaries of the spacetime by
investigating the spacelike geodesics that join the boundaries. These dominate
the correlators for large mass bulk fields. We show that the Penrose diagram
for d>3 is not square. As a result, the real geodesic connecting the two
boundary points becomes almost null and bounces off the singularity at a finite
boundary time t_c \neq 0. If this geodesic were to dominate the correlator
there would be a ""light cone"" singularity at t_c. However, general properties
of the boundary theory rule this out. In fact, we argue that the correlator is
actually dominated by a complexified geodesic, whose properties yield the large
mass quasinormal mode frequencies previously found for this black hole. We find
a branch cut in the correlator at small time (in the limit of large mass),
arising from coincidence of three geodesics. The t_c singularity, a signal of
the black hole singularity, occurs on a secondary sheet of the analytically
continued correlator. Its properties are computationally accessible. The t_c
singularity persists to all orders in the 1/m expansion, for finite \alpha',
and to all orders in g_s. Certain leading nonperturbative effects can also be
studied. The behavior of these boundary theory quantities near t_c gives, in
principle, significant information about stringy and quantum behavior in the

or nonlinear. One core is active, featuring intrinsic linear gain, while the
other one is lossy. The difference from previously studied models involving a
pair of linearly coupled active and passive cores is that the stabilization of
the system is provided not by a linear diffusion-like term, but rather by a
cubic or quintic dissipative term in the active core. Physical realizations of
the models include systems from nonlinear optics (semiconductor waveguides or
optical cavities), and a double-cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate with a
negative scattering length, in which the active ``cigar'' is an atom laser. The
replacement of the diffusion term by the nonlinear loss is principally
important, as diffusion does not occur in these physical media, while nonlinear
loss is possible. A stability region for solitary pulses is found in the
system's parameter space by means of direct simulations. One border of the
region is also found in an analytical form by means of a perturbation theory.
Moving pulses are studied too. It is concluded that collisions between them are
completely elastic, provided that the relative velocity is not too small. The
pulses withstand multiple tunneling through potential barriers. Robust
quantum-rachet regimes of motion of the pulse in a time-periodic asymmetric
potential are found as well.

measurement of the 13C(6Li,d)17O reaction at E_lab = 60 MeV has been performed
recently by Kubono et al., who found a new value for the spectroscopic factor
of the 6.356 MeV 1/2+ state of 17O based on a distorted wave Born approximation
(DWBA) analysis of these data. This new value, S_alpha approximately = 0.011,

linear transformation into outgoing ones. In general, the quantum version of
such transformations may mix annihilation and creation operators. We derive a
simple formula for the effective Hamiltonian of a general linear quantum
network, if such a Hamiltonian exists. Otherwise we show how the scattering
matrix of the network is decomposed into a product of three matrices that can
be generated by Hamiltonians.

matrices rho(T) for a general multidimensional quantum problem is presented.
The variational principle applied to the ``imaginary time'' Schroedinger
equation provides the equations of motion for Gaussians in a resolution of
rho(T) described by their width matrix, center and scale factor, all treated as
dynamical variables.
  The method is computationally very inexpensive, has favorable scaling with
the system size and is surprisingly accurate in a wide temperature range, even
for cases involving quantum tunneling. Incorporation of symmetry constraints,
such as reflection or particle statistics, is also discussed.

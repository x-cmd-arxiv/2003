potential display simple tracking behavior at early times, when the
quintessence energy density, rho_phi, is sub-dominant. At late times, when
rho_phi becomes comparable to the matter density, the evolution of phi diverges
from its scaling behavior. We calculate the first order departure of phi from
its tracker solution at low redshift. Our results for the evolution of phi,
rho_phi, Omega_phi, and w are suprisingly accurate even down to z=0. We find
that w and Omega_phi are related linearly to first order. We also derive a
semi-analytic expression for w(z) which is accurate to within a few percent.
Our analytic techniques are potentially applicable to any quintessence model in
which the quintessence component comes to dominate at late times.

hydrodynamic turbulence in the absence of magnetic field. We explain why the
non-linearities of the hydrodynamic equations (i.e. turbulent diffusion) should
not be neglected, either as a simplifying approximation or based on boundary
counditions. The consequences of lifting this hypothesis are studied for the
flow stability and the enhanced turbulent transport. We develop a simple
general model for the energetics of turbulent fluctuations in differentially
rotating flows. By taking into account the non-linearities of the equations of
motions, we give constraints on the mean flow properties for the possible
development of shear instability. The results from recent laboratory
experiments on rotating flows show -- in agreement with the model -- that the
pertinent parameter for stability appears to be the Rossby number Ro. The
laboratory experiments seem to be compatible with Ro<-1/2 and Ro > 1 in the
inviscid or high rotation rates limit. Our results, taken in the inviscid
limit, are coherent with the classical linear stability analysis, in the sense
that the critical perturbation equals zero on the marginal linear stability
curve. We also propose a prescription for turbulent viscosity which generalize

temperature, indicative of flare heating of coronal plasma. Line widths
interpreted in terms of Doppler broadening suggest that both binary stellar
components are active. From line fluxes obtained from total integrated spectra,
we have modeled the emission measure and abundance distributions. A strong
maximum was found in the differential emission measure, characterized by peaks
at log T = 6.9 and 7.4, together with a weak but significant cooler maximum
near log T=6.2, and a moderately strong hot tail from log T= 7.6-8.2. Coronal

results from these three instruments are presented. The results show that,
subject to a reasonable value for the Hubble constant, which is degenerate with
the geometry in closed models, the geometry of the Universe is flat to high
precision (~5%) and the primordial fluctuation spectrum is very close to the
scale-invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum. Both of these findings are
concordant with inflationary predictions. The results also show that the
baryonic matter content is consistent with that found from primordial
nucleosynthesis, while the cold dark matter component can account for no more
than ~40% of the energy density of the Universe. It is a requirement of these
observations, therefore, that ~60% of the energy content of the Universe is not
related to matter, either baryonic or nonbaryonic. This dark energy component
of the energy density is attributed to a nonzero cosmological constant.

generation. With only a very few exceptions, the numerical treatment of
homogeneous dynamos is carried out in the framework of the differential
equation approach. The present paper tries to facilitate the use of integral
equations in dynamo research. Apart from the pedagogical value to illustrate
dynamo action within the well-known picture of Biot-Savart's law, the integral
equation approach has a number of practical advantages. The first advantage is
its proven numerical robustness and stability. The second and perhaps most
important advantage is its applicability to dynamos in arbitrary geometries.
The third advantage is its intimate connection to inverse problems relevant not
only for dynamos but also for technical applications of magnetohydrodynamics.
The paper provides the first general formulation and application of the
integral equation approach to time-dependent kinematic dynamos in finite
domains. For the spherically symmetric alpha^2 dynamo model it is shown how the
general formulation is reduced to a coupled system of two radial integral
equations for the defining scalars of the poloidal and the toroidal field
components. The integral equation formulation for spherical dynamos with
general velocity fields is also derived. Two numerical examples, the alpha^2
dynamo model with radially varying alpha, and the Bullard-Gellman model
illustrate the equivalence of the approach with the usual differential equation
method.

covering a redshift range from about 0.2 to 2.0. These two sets of optically
bright and intrinsically luminous QSOs are well matched in the redshift-optical
luminosity ($z - M_B$) plane. Our CCD monitoring covered a total of 61 nights
with an average of 6.1 hours of densely sampled monitoring of just a single QSO
per night, thereby achieving a typical detection threshold of $\sim 1$%
variation over the night. Unambiguous detection of intra-night
variability(INOV) amplitudes in the range 1$-$3% on day-like or shorter time
scales were thus made for both RQQs and LDQs. Based on these clear detections
of INOV, we estimate duty cycles of 17% and 9% for RQQs and LDQs, respectively;
inclusion of the two cases of probable variations of LDQs would raise the duty
cycle to 15% for LDQs. The similarity in the duty cycle and amplitude of INOV
for the RQQs and LDQs suggests, firstly, that the radio loudness alone does not
guarantee an enhanced INOV in QSOs and,secondly, that as in LDQs, relativistic
jets may also be present in RQQs. We argue that, as compared to BL Lacs, the
conspicuously milder, rarer and possibly slower INOV of RQQs and LDQs, can in
fact be readily understood in terms of their having optical synchrotron jets
which are modestly misaligned from us,but are otherwise intrinsically as
relativistic and active as the jets in BL Lacs.

classified in terms of {\em generations}: subspaces of excitations containing a
specific number of electron-hole pairs. This yields a hierarchy of populated
excited states of the nanograin that strongly depends on (a) the available
electronic energy levels; and (b) the ratio between the electronic relaxation
rate within the nano-grain and the bottleneck rate for tunneling transitions.
To study the response of the electronic energy level structure of the nanograin
to the excitations, and its signature in the tunneling spectrum, we propose a
microscopic mean-field theory. Two main features emerge when considering an Al
nanograin coated with Al oxide: (i) The electronic energy response fluctuates
strongly in the presence of disorder, from level to level and excitation to
excitation. Such fluctuations produce a dramatic sample dependence of the
tunneling spectra. On the other hand, for excitations that are energetically
accessible at low applied bias voltages, the magnitude of the response,
reflected in the renormalization of the single-electron energy levels, is
smaller than the average spacing between energy levels. (ii) If the tunneling
and electronic relaxation time scales are such as to admit a significant
non-equilibrium population of the excited nanoparticle states, it should be
possible to realize much higher spectral densities of resonances than have been
observed to date in such devices. These resonances arise from tunneling into
ground-state and excited electronic energy levels, as well as from charge
fluctuations present during tunneling.

with zero-chirality of both zig-zag and armchair geometry. The model allows
include into the pure phonon problem existing interaction with others
subsystems: electrons, photons, impurities and defects. We predict that planar
C- structures are geometrically stable and may bridge interelectrode space in
strong external electric field. The exact solution of generalized thermal
conductivity (TC) equation was obtained for nanotubes. Temperature distribution
along the tube was derived analytically. The diagonalization procedure for the
case ofstrong ph-ph interaction was proposed. It was shown the quadratic
increasing of heat conductivity with the growth of the phonon mean free path
(PMFP). Heat capacitance and the entropy of carbon linear tubes were calculated
as the function of temperature. Our theoretical approach explains the nature of
good TC in carbon and carbon-like materials by existing of the soft vibration
branch (low frequency radial breathing mode phonons with high density of states
at thermal energies) accompanied by structure hardness (high frequency $\phi$-
and z-branches) providing big PMFP. TC coefficient for high conducting channel
in surrounding medium was calculated. The mechanism of heat conductivity
temperature damping was analyzed. Two competitive tendencies produce TC maximum
at intermediate temperatures (100-300)K. It was shown the strongly non-linear
increasing of effective heat conductivity with the growth nanotubes
concentration. It was shown that insertion of armchair nanotube inside a medium
or its coating by polyacetilene molecule considerably changes the structure of
radial breathing phonons.

crystal acting as a quarter wave plate to induce a degree of circular
polarisation in a high energy linearly polarised photon beam. The linearly
polarised photon beam is produced from coherent bremsstrahlung radiation by 178
GeV unpolarised electrons incident on an aligned Si crystal, acting as a
radiator. The linear polarisation of the photon beam is characterised by
measuring the asymmetry in electron-positron pair production in a Ge crystal,
for different crystal orientations. The Ge crystal therefore acts as an
analyser. The birefringence phenomenon, which converts the linear polarisation
to circular polarisation, is observed by letting the linearly polarised photons
beam pass through a thick Si quarter wave plate crystal, and then measuring the
asymmetry in electron-positron pair production again for a selection of
relative angles between the crystallographic planes of the radiator, analyser
and quarter wave plate. The systematics of the difference between the measured
asymmetries with and without the quarter wave plate are predicted by theory to
reveal an evolution in the Stokes parameters from which the appearance of a
circularly polarised component in the photon beam can be demonstrated. The
measured magnitude of the circularly polarised component was consistent with
the theoretical predictions, and therefore is in indication of the existence of
the birefringence effect.

vanishing momentum of any final pion. Combining the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI)

to power corrections to the QCD factorization theorem for heavy quark

been proposed to explain these asymmetries. In heavy-quark recombination, a
light quark or antiquark participates in a hard scattering which produces a
charm-anticharm quark pair. The light quark or antiquark emerges from the
scattering with small momentum in the rest frame of the charm quark, and
together they hadronize into a charm particle. The cross section for this
process can be calculated within perturbative QCD up to an overall
normalization. Heavy-quark recombination explains the observed D meson and
\Lambda_c asymmetries with a minimal set of universal nonperturbative

terms of a square root branch cut on the complex plane, as previously found for
a set of solutions for which the details are very different. This, together
with the existence of the single simple non-linear differential equation, is
further evidence in support of an earlier suggestion that there is a very

role of the modular parameter $\tau(C_2,\Lambda)$ of torus. Consequently the

the holographic entropy bounds in the early universe. This contrasts to the

tensor C^N, N being any odd positive integer, associated to hyperbolic ideal
tetrahedra equipped with an additional decoration. The matrix dilogarithms
satisfy fundamental five-term identities that correspond to decorated versions
of the 2 --> 3 move on 3-dimensional triangulations. Together with the
decoration, they arise from the solution we give of a symmetrization problem
for a specific family of basic matrix dilogarithms, the classical (N=1) one
being the Rogers dilogarithm, which only satisfy one special instance of
five-term identity. We use the matrix dilogarithms to construct invariant state
sums for closed oriented 3-manifolds $W$ endowed with a flat principal
PSL(2,C)-bundle rho, and a fixed non empty link L if N>1, and for (possibly
""marked"") cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds M. When N=1 the state sums recover
known simplicial formulas for the volume and the Chern-Simons invariant. When
N>$, the invariants for M are new; those for triples (W,L,rho) coincide with
the quantum hyperbolic invariants defined in [Topology 43 (2004) 1373-1423],
though our present approach clarifies substantially their nature. We analyse
the structural coincidences versus discrepancies between the cases N=1 and N>1,
and we formulate ""Volume Conjectures"", having geometric motivations, about the
asymptotic behaviour of the invariants when N tends to infinity.

particular detector elements. These identifiers provide a sort of ?glue?
allowing, for example, the connection of raw event data to their detector
description for position calculation or alignment corrections, as well as fast
access to subsets of the event data for event trigger selection. There are two
important requirements on the software to support such an identification
scheme. First is the possibility to formally specify these identifiers in terms
of their structure and allowed values. And second is to generate different
forms of the identifiers optimised in terms of access efficiency to information
content, compactness or search key efficiency. We present here the generic
toolkit developed in the context of the ATLAS experiment to primarily provide
the identification of the readout channels and detector elements. The
architecture of the toolkit is decomposed into three parts: an XML-based
dictionary containing the formal specification of a particular range of
identifiers, a set of various identifier classes (offering various level of
compaction), and finally a set of ?helper? classes, specific for each detector
system, which serve as intermediaries between the dictionary and the identifier
classes to create, manipulate and interpret the identifiers. This architecture
will be described as well as the various applications of this identification

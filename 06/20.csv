large scale structure (galaxy redshift survey) and X-ray galaxy cluster (baryon
fraction and X-ray luminosity function) data, assuming a geometrically flat
cosmological model and allowing for tensor components and a non-negligible
neutrino mass. From a combined analysis of all data, assuming three degenerate
neutrinos species, we measure a contribution of neutrinos to the energy density
of the universe, Omega_nu h^2=0.0059^{+0.0033}_{-0.0027} (68 per cent
confidence limits), with zero falling on the 99 per cent confidence limit. This
corresponds to ~4 per cent of the total mass density of the Universe and
implies a species-summed neutrino mass \sum_i m_i =0.56^{+0.30}_{-0.26} eV, or
m_nu~0.2 eV per neutrino. We examine possible sources of systematic uncertainty
in the results. Combining the CMB, large scale structure and cluster baryon
fraction data, we measure an amplitude of mass fluctuations on 8h^{-1} Mpc
scales of sigma_8=0.74^{+0.12}_{-0.07}, which is consistent with measurements
based on the X-ray luminosity function and other studies of the number density
and evolution of galaxy clusters. This value is lower than that obtained when
fixing a negligible neutrino mass (sigma_8=0.86^{+0.08}_{-0.07}). The
combination of CMB, large scale structure and cluster baryon fraction data also
leads to remarkably tight constraints on the Hubble constant,
H_0=68.4^{+2.0}_{-1.4} km/s/Mpc, mean matter density, Omega_m =0.31\pm0.02 and
physical baryon density, Omega_b h^2=0.024\pm0.001, of the Universe.

the terrestrial planets, notably Mercury. The updated model is called SONYR

accurate solution of the spin-orbit motion of Mercury permits to analyze the
different families of the Hermean rotational librations. The spin-orbit motion
of Mercury is characterized by two proper frequencies (namely 15.847 and 1066
years) and its 3:2 resonance presents a second synchronism which can be
understood as a spin-orbit secular resonance (278 898 years). By using the
SONYR model, we find a new determination of the mean obliquity, namely 1.6
arcminutes. Besides, we identify in the Hermean librations the impact of the
uncertainty of the greatest principal moment of inertia (\cmr2) on the
obliquity and on the libration in longitude (2.3 mas and 0.45 as respectively
for an increase of 1% on the \cmr2 value). These determinations prove to be
suitable for providing constraints on the internal structure of Mercury.

intriguing as only about 25% of the Lyman-Break selected galaxies at similar

clusters and/or very massive (O7-O4) stars. Our data show that the clouds are
very clumpy and of irregular morphology. They usually have much larger masses,
velocity dispersions, and fractions of dense gas than molecular clouds that
form early B or late O stars. This is compatible with earlier findings that
more massive stars form in more massive cores. 13CO cores are in general
associated with compact HII regions regardless of the presence of UC HII
regions therein. In contrast, CS cores are preferentially associated with
compact HII regions that contain UC HII regions. As with the fact that the
compact HII regions containing UC HII regions are more compact than those not
associated with UC HII regions, these indicate that the former may be in an
earlier evolutionary phase than the latter. The diffuse extended envelopes of
HII regions often develop in the direction of decreasing molecular gas density.
Based on detailed comparison of molecular line data with radio continuum and
recombination line data, the extended ionized envelopes are likely the results
of champagne flows in at least 10 sources in our sample. Together these results
appear to support a published suggestion that the extended emission around UC
HII regions can be naturally understood by combining the champagne flow model
with the hierarchical structure of molecular clouds. We discuss the implication

behaviour and have anomalously high intensities compared with other transition

through extensive non-LTE radiative transfer calculations. The model
atmospheres of Vernazza, Avrett & Loeser are found to provide reasonable
matches to the helium resonance line intensities but significantly
over-estimate the intensities of other transition region lines. New model
atmospheres have been developed from emission measure distributions derived by
Macpherson & Jordan, which are consistent with SOHO observations of transition
region lines other than those of helium. These models fail to reproduce the
observed helium resonance line intensities by significant factors. The
possibility that non-Maxwellian electron distributions in the transition region
might lead to increased collisional excitation rates in the helium lines is
studied. Collisional excitation and ionization rates are re-computed for
distribution functions with power law suprathermal tails which may form by the
transport of fast electrons from high temperature regions. Enhancements of the
helium resonance line intensities are found, but many of the predictions of the
models regarding line ratios are inconsistent with observations. These results
suggest that any such departures from Maxwellian electron distributions are not
responsible for the helium resonance line intensities.

perturbation. We show that the latter is a function not only of the spatial
variations of the decay rate generated during inflation, as envisaged in a
recently proposed scenario, but also of the time variation of the inflaton
decay rate during reheating. If only the second source is present, the final
curvature perturbation at the end of the reheating stage is proportional to the
curvature perturbation at the beginning of reheating with a coefficient of
proportionality which can be either smaller or larger than unity depending upon
the underlying physics governing the time variation of the inflaton decay rate.
As a consequence, we show that the standard consistency relation between the
amplitude of curvature perturbations, the amplitude of tensor perturbations and
the tensor spectral index of one-single field models of inflation is violated
and there is the possibility that the tensor-to-curvature amplitude ratio is
larger than in the standard case.

accomplished. We investigate the influence of the structure of the progenitor
and energy deposition rate on the resulting explosive nucleosynthesis, assuming
that 56Ni is mainly synthesized in the jet launched by the neutrino heating. We
show the amount of 56Ni is very sensitive to the energy deposition rate. Thus
we conclude that it is quite natural not to detect an underlying supernova in
some X-ray afterglows as in GRB 010921. We also point out the possibility that
the relative abundance of the elements with intermediate mass number such as Si
and S in the X-ray afterglow of GRB 011211 may be naturally explained if the
energy deposition rate at the central engine is relatively long because little
amount of 56Ni should be synthesized under such an environment. If this
discussion is true, there should be correlation between the line features in
the X-ray afterglow and duration of the GRB. It should be noted that the
duration of GRB 011211 is 270 seconds, making it the longest burst ever
observed by Beppo-SAX although it suffers from the effect of red-shift
(z_host=2.14), which supports our conclusion. Our results also suggest that the
type I collapsar model in which the energy deposition rate is relatively low
(\dot{E} \sim 10^{51} erg/s) might have difficulty in reproducing the observed
amount of 56Ni in a hypernova such as SN 1998bw. This means that the mechanism
of the central engine of a hypernova accompanying GRB may be constrained by the
discussion of explosive nucleosynthesis.

originate from such encounters. The two most popular modes of energy extraction
-- namely the annihilation of $\nu\bar{\nu}$ and magnetohydrodynamic processes-
are explored in order to investigate their viability in launching GRBs. We find
that $\nu\bar{\nu}$ annihilation can provide the necessary stresses to drive a
highly relativistic expansion. But unless the outflow is beamed into less than
one percent of the solid angle this mechanism may fail to explain the apparent
isotropized energies implied for short GRBs at cosmological distances. We argue
that the energetic, neutrino-driven wind that accompanies the merger event will
have enough pressure to provide adequate collimation to the
$\nu\bar{\nu}$-annihilation-driven jet, thereby comfortably satisfying
constraints on event rate and apparent luminosity. We also assess magnetic
mechanisms to transform the available energy into a GRB. If the central object
does not collapse immediately into a black hole it will be convective and it is
expected to act as an effective large scale dynamo amplifying the seed magnetic
fields to a few times $10^{17}$ G within a small fraction of a second. The
associated spindown time scale is 0.2 s, coinciding with the typical duration
of a short GRB. The efficiencies of the various assessed magnetic processes are
high enough to produce isotropized luminosities in excess of $10^{52}$ ergs/s
even without beaming.

allows to describe different driving schemes. We find phase separation into a

In a $v$-platoon all cars move with velocity $v$ and have vanishing headway.
The velocity $v$ of a platoon only depends on the strength of anticipation. At
high densities, a congested state characterized by the coexistence of a

a specific example, we furthermore demonstrate the importance of a precise m_t
value for the prediction of sparticle masses and for constraints on the

significantly affects the reconstruction of the supersymmetric high scale

unnatural from the point of view of grand unified theories, that are well

string derived SO(10) GUT models, in which the SO(10) symmetry is broken
directly at the string theory level. A characteristic feature of such models is
the appearance of numerous SO(10) singlet fields. We propose that the mismatch
between the quark and lepton mixing parameters arises due to this extended
singlet spectrum and its mixing with the right-handed neutrinos. We discuss a
string inspired effective parameterization of the extended neutrino mass matrix
and demonstrates that the coupling with the SO(10) singlet spectrum can readily
account for the neutrino flavor parameters. The mechanism implies that some

possibilty of deriving the neutrino mass spectrum from string theory in a
specific string derived vacuum solution, and comment on the properties that
such a solution should possess.

inflationary phase at early times. At late times, on the other hand, it

the flat or cosmological constant background, with the acceleration A being
provided by a strut in-between that pushes away the two black holes. In this
paper we analyze the extremal limits of the C-metric in a background with
generic cosmological constant. We follow a procedure first introduced by
Ginsparg and Perry in which the Nariai solution, a spacetime which is the
direct topological product of the 2-dimensional dS and a 2-sphere, is generated
from the four-dimensional dS-Schwarzschild solution by taking an appropriate
limit, where the black hole event horizon approaches the cosmological horizon.
Similarly, one can generate the Bertotti-Robinson metric from the
Reissner-Nordstrom metric by taking the limit of the Cauchy horizon going into
the event horizon of the black hole, as well as the anti-Nariai by taking an
appropriate solution and limit. Using these methods we generate the C-metric
counterparts of the Nariai, Bertotti-Robinson and anti-Nariai solutions, among
others. One expects that the solutions found in this paper are unstable and
decay into a slightly non-extreme black hole pair accelerated by a strut or by
strings. Moreover, the Euclidean version of these solutions mediate the quantum
process of black hole pair creation, that accompanies the decay of the dS and
AdS spaces.

surfaces branched over the given 2m+2 points. These Riemann surfaces are
constructed from a permutation representation of the symmetric group S_N to
which the quasi-permutation monodromy representation has been reduced. The
permutation representation of our problem generates the cyclic subgroup Z_N.
For this reason the corresponding Riemann surfaces of genus N(m-1) have Z_N
symmetry. This fact enables us to write the matrix entries of the solution of
the NxN Riemann-Hilbert problem as a product of an algebraic function and
theta-function quotients. The algebraic function turns out to be related to the
Szego kernel with zero characteristics. From the solution of the Riemann-
Hilbert problem we automatically obtain a particular solution of the
Schlesinger system. The tau-function of the Schlesinger system is computed
explicitly. The rank 3 problem with four singular points (0,t,1,\infty) is
studied in detail. The corresponding solution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem
and the Schlesinger system is given in terms of Jacobi's theta-function with
modulus T=T(t), Im(T)>0. The function T=T(t) is invertible if it belongs to the
Siegel upper half space modulo the subgroup \Gamma_0(3) of the modular group.

$DGR^*\to\ass^\Delta$, although not itself an equivalence, does induce one at
the level of homotopy categories. The dual of this result for chain $DG$ and

functor $Q:DGR^*\to \ass^\Delta$, naturally homotopy equivalent to $K$, which
preserves the closed model structure. It also has other interesting
applications. For example, we use $Q$ to prove a noncommutative version of the
Hochschild-Konstant-Rosenberg and Loday-Quillen theorems. Our version applies
to the cyclic module that arises from a homomorphism $R\to S$ of not
necessarily commutative rings when the coproduct $\coprod_R$ of associative
$R$-algebras is substituted for $\otimes_R$. As another application of the

that of formal logic, providing for the pragmatic treatment of features of
argumentation which cannot be reduced to logical form. The central claim of
this paper is that a more nuanced understanding of mathematical proof and
discovery may be achieved by paying attention to the aspects of mathematical
argumentation which can be captured by informal, rather than formal, logic. Two
accounts of argumentation are considered: the pioneering work of Stephen
Toulmin [The uses of argument, Cambridge University Press, 1958] and the more
recent studies of Douglas Walton, [e.g. The new dialectic: Conversational
contexts of argument, University of Toronto Press, 1998]. The focus of both of
these approaches has largely been restricted to natural language argumentation.
However, Walton's method in particular provides a fruitful analysis of
mathematical proof. He offers a contextual account of argumentational
strategies, distinguishing a variety of different types of dialogue in which
arguments may occur. This analysis represents many different fallacious or
otherwise illicit arguments as the deployment of strategies which are sometimes
admissible in contexts in which they are inadmissible. I argue that
mathematical proofs are deployed in a greater variety of types of dialogue than
has commonly been assumed. I proceed to show that many of the important
philosophical and pedagogical problems of mathematical proof arise from a
failure to make explicit the type of dialogue in which the proof is introduced.

satisfactory only in the vicinity of the expansion point. Thus, it is an

avaliable in the case of a special function -- all power series coefficients as

alternative rational approximants, which can profit from additional information

neutral regions is almost totally ignored. The assumptions of zero field in the
neutral regions and conduction by minority carrier diffusion lead to a number
of pedagogical problems and paradoxes for the student. The purpose of this
paper is to address the pedagogical problems and paradoxes apparent in the
current treatment of conduction in the pn junction as it appears in the
majority of texts.

arbitrarily coupled qubits (describable by 4 x 4 density matrices) are
separable with an a priori probability of 8/(11 \pi^2) = 0.0736881. For this
purpose, we employed the normalized volume element of the Bures (minimal
monotone) metric as a probability distribution over the fifteen-dimensional
convex set of 4 x 4 density matrices. Here, we provide further/independent
(quasi-Monte Carlo numerical integration) evidence of a stronger nature (giving
an estimate of 0.0736858 vs. 0.0737012 previously) for this conjecture.
Additionally, employing a certain ansatz, we estimate the probabilities of
separability based on certain other monotone metrics of interest. However, we
find ourselves, at this point, unable to convincingly conjecture exact simple
formulas for these new (smaller) probabilities.

complete noise suppression in the proper quadratures difference of any
orthogonal polarization components. We show the entanglement of the state of
symmetric intense, or macroscopic, spatial light modes. We also investigate
nonclassical polarization properties in terms of the Stokes operators. We find
perfect correlations in all Stokes parameters measured in opposite far field
points in the direction orthogonal to the walk-off, while locally the field is
unpolarized and we find no polarization squeezing.

its relation with the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality.
Without the need for full quantum tomography for the density matrix we can
experimentally detect the entanglement by measuring less than 9 local
observables for any given state. We show that this test is stronger than the
CHSH-Bell inequality and also gives an estimation for the degree of
entanglement. If prior knowledge is available we can further greatly reduce the
number of required local observables. The test is convenient and feasible with
present experimental technology.

based on homodyne detection and post-selection is investigated for several
specific eavesdropping strategies. It is shown that amplitude squeezing creates
strong correlations between the signals of the legitimate receiver and a
potential eavesdropper. Post-selection of the received pulses can therefore be
used to reduce the eavesdropper's knowledge of the raw key, which increases the
secret key rate by orders of magnitude over large distances even for modest
amounts of squeezing.

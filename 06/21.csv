  formation caused by more than one spiral density wave","18 pages, 7 figures, 1 table",,"10.1086/379299",,"astro-ph",,"  In the inner 3kpc of M51 we find that logarithmic spirals provide good fits
to the peak intensities in molecular gas observed by BIMA in the CO (J=1-0)
emission line along the spiral arms. However, we measure significant
asymmetries between the location and density of the arms observed on one side
of the galaxy compared to those on the opposite side. Between a radius of 1 and
2.2 kpc the gas distribution traced in CO is lopsided with densities twice as
large in one arm compared to the opposite one. In the same region, the spiral
arms are offset by 20 degrees from the position of the arm on the opposite side
of the galaxy after a rotation of 180 degrees. We use the ratio of CO emission
to that in the Pa alpha hydrogen recombination line to estimate the efficiency
of star formation along each arm. Except for a narrow region at about 2kpc
where star formation is surprisingly inefficient, the gas depletion time is
approximately 200 million years despite large variations in the molecular gas
density in the arms.
  We account for the deviations from two armed bi-symmetric structure with a
simple model that includes an additional three-armed spiral density wave. This
model accounts for the angular offset between the arm on one side compared to
its opposite, the lopsided distribution in molecular gas, and inter-arm star
formation to the north east of the galaxy nucleus. Since the star formation
efficiency is unaffected by the variations in gas density, and the variations
in gas density can be accounted for by the presence of an additional
three-armed density wave, we suggest that the star formation rate is variable,
and is highest where and when the maxima of the two spiral density waves
coincide or constructively add.

slope comparable to those observed in typical elliptical galaxies. The CLF of
the bulge is a broken power law similar to measurements made by previous

sources. In addition, 17 sources are likely X-ray transients. We analyze
follow-up HST WFPC2 data of two X-ray transients, finding F336W (U-band
equivalent) counterparts. In both cases, the counterparts are variable. In one
case, the optical counterpart is transient with F336W = 22.3 +/- 0.1 mag. The
X-ray and optical properties of this object are consistent with a ~10 solar

circular orbit in the limit of low disk viscosity. This regime may be
appropriate to an aging disk after the epoch of planet formation. We find that
the distance of planet to the gap outer boundary can be between the location of
the $m=2$ and $m=1$ outer Lindblad resonances. This distance is weakly
dependent upon both the planet's mass and disk viscosity. We find that the
evolution of the disk edge takes place on two timescales. The first timescale
is set by the spiral density waves driven by the planet. The second timescale
depends on the viscosity of the disk. The disk approaches a state where the
outward angular momentum flux caused by the disk viscosity is balanced by the
dissipation of spiral density waves which are driven at the Lindblad
resonances. This occurs inefficiently however because of the extremely low gas
density near the planet. We find that the distance between the planet and the
peak density at the disk outer edge is only weakly dependent on the viscosity
and planet mass, however the ratio of the gas density near the planet to that
in the disk (or the slope of density along the disk edge) is strongly dependent
upon both quantities. We find that the disk density profile along the edge
scales approximately with disk viscosity divided by the square of the planet
mass. We account for this behavior with a simple scenario in which the
dissipation of angular momentum from the spiral density waves is balanced
against diffusion in the steep edge of the disk.

resulted in any detections of comparable luminous QSO pairs, and it is thus not
yet clear how representative is this structure at z ~ 5. However, along with
the other evidence for clustering of quasars and young galaxies at somewhat
lower redshifts, the observations are at least qualitatively consistent with a
strong biasing of the first luminous and massive objects, in agreement with
general predictions of theoretical models. More extensive searches for
clustered quasars and luminous galaxies at these redshifts will provide
valuable empirical constraints for our understanding of early galaxy and

emission from ionization states of Fe in the range ~Fe I up to Fe XXVI is
observed. The ionization balance of Fe responds to continuum variations on

horizons. This is because it is first necessary to understand the ionization
structure of accretion disks and the relation between the X-ray continuum and
Fe K line emission. However, we also describe how our results are suggestive of
a means of measuring black-hole spin without a knowledge of the relation

connectivity properties fully characterized in analytical fashion. By assuming
that all neurons have the same shape and are regularly distributed along the
two-dimensional orthogonal lattice with parameter $\Delta$, it is possible to
obtain the accurate number of connections and cycles of any length from the
autoconvolution function as well as from the respective spectral density
derived from the adjacency matrix. It is shown that neuronal shape plays an
important role in defining the spatial spread of network connections. In
addition, most such networks are characterized by the interesting phenomenon
where the connections are progressively shifted along the spatial domain where
the network is embedded. It is also shown that the number of cycles follows a
power law with their respective length. Morphological measurements for
characterization of the spatial distribution of connections, including the
adjacency matrix spectral density and the lacunarity of the connections, are
suggested. The potential of the proposed approach is illustrated with respect
to digital images of real neuronal cells.

spaceborne gravitational wave detectors, several combinations of signals have
been found that allow the laser noise to be canceled out while gravitational
wave signals remain. This process is called time delay interferometry (TDI). In
the papers that defined the TDI variables, their performance was evaluated in
the limit that the gravitational wave detector is fixed in space. However, the
performance depends on certain symmetries in the armlengths that are available
if the detector is fixed in space, but that will be broken in the actual
rotating and flexing configuration produced by the LISA orbits. In this paper
we investigate the performance of these TDI variables for the real LISA orbits.
First, addressing the effects of rotation, we verify Daniel Shaddock's result
that the Sagnac variables will not cancel out the laser phase noise, and we
also find the same result for the symmetric Sagnac variable. The loss of the
latter variable would be particularly unfortunate since this variable also
cancels out gravitational wave signal, allowing instrument noise in the
detector to be isolated and measured. Fortunately, we have found a set of more
complicated TDI variables, which we call Delta-Sagnac variables, one of which
accomplishes the same goal as the symmetric Sagnac variable to good accuracy.
Finally, however, as we investigate the effects of the flexing of the detector
arms due to non-circular orbital motion, we show that all variables, including
the interferometer variables, which survive the rotation-induced loss of
direction symmetry, will not completely cancel laser phase noise when the
armlengths are changing with time. This unavoidable problem will place a
stringent requirement on laser stability of 5 Hz per root Hz.

dimensional reduction of multidimensional cosmological models with factorizable
geometry and consider the interaction between conformal excitations of the
internal space (geometrical moduli excitations) and Abelian gauge fields. It is
assumed that the internal space background can be stabilized by minima of an
effective potential. The conformal excitations over such a background have the
form of massive scalar fields (gravitational excitons) propagating in the
external spacetime. We discuss cosmological and astrophysical implications of
the interaction between gravexcitons and four-dimensional photons as well as
constraints arising on multidimensional models of the type considered in our
paper. In particular, we show that due to the experimental bounds on the
variation of the fine structure constant, gravexcitons should decay before
nucleosynthesis starts. For a successful nucleosynthesis the masses of the
decaying gravexcitons should be m>10^4 GeV. Furthermore, we discuss the
possible contribution of gravexcitons to UHECR. It is shown that, at energies
of about 10^{20}eV, the decay length of gravexcitons with masses m>10^4 GeV is
very small, but that for m <10^2 GeV it becomes much larger than the
Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cut-off distance. Finally, we investigate the
possibility for gravexciton-photon oscillations in strong magnetic fields of
astrophysical objects. The corresponding estimates indicate that even the high
magnetic field strengths of magnetars are not sufficient for an efficient and
copious production of gravexcitons.

remove, as a byproduct, the obstacles arising in the generalization to

quantum chemistry methods and density functional theory (DFT). The structure
and energetics of important isomers is obtained to unprecedented accuracy
without resorting to experiment. The global minimum of eclipsed C_s symmetry is
characterized by a significantly bent hydrogen bond which deviates from
linearity by about 20 degrees. In addition, the so-called cyclic C_{2h}
structure is extremely close in energy on an overall flat potential energy
surface. It is demonstrated that none of the currently available (GGA,
meta--GGA, and hybrid) density functionals satisfactorily describe the
structure and relative energies of this nonlinear hydrogen bond. We present a
novel density functional, HCTH/407+, designed to describe this sort of hydrogen
bond quantitatively on the level of the dimer, contrary to e.g. the widely used
BLYP functional. This improved functional is employed in Car-Parrinello ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations of liquid ammonia to judge its
performance in describing the associated liquid. Both the HCTH/407+ and BLYP
functionals describe the properties of the liquid well as judged by analysis of
radial distribution functions, hydrogen bonding structure and dynamics,
translational diffusion, and orientational relaxation processes. It is
demonstrated that the solvation shell of the ammonia molecule in the liquid
phase is dominated by steric packing effects and not so much by directional
hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition, the propensity of ammonia molecules
to form bifurcated and multifurcated hydrogen bonds in the liquid phase is
found to be negligibly small.

variables. We show that such protocols can be made secure against individual
gaussian attacks regardless the transmission of the optical line between Alice
and Bob. This is achieved by reversing the reconciliation procedure subsequent
to the quantum transmission, that is, using Bob's instead of Alice's data to
build the key. Although squeezing or entanglement may be helpful to improve the
resistance to noise, they are not required for the protocols to remain secure
with high losses. Therefore, these protocols can be implemented very simply by
transmitting coherent states and performing homodyne detection. Here, we show
that entanglement nevertheless plays a crucial role in the security analysis of
coherent state protocols. Every cryptographic protocol based on displaced
gaussian states turns out to be equivalent to an entanglement-based protocol,
even though no entanglement is actually present. This equivalence even holds in
the absence of squeezing, for coherent state protocols. This ``virtual''
entanglement is important to assess the security of these protocols as it
provides an upper bound on the mutual information between Alice and Bob if they
had used entanglement. The resulting security criteria are compared to the
separability criterion for bipartite gaussian variables. It appears that the
security thresholds are well within the entanglement region. This supports the
idea that coherent state quantum cryptography may be unconditionally secure.

However, at present modal dynamics are only applicable to situations that are
described in the orthodox theory by projective measures. In this paper we
extend modal dynamics to include positive operator measures (POMs). That is,
for example, rather than using a complete set of orthogonal projectors, we can
use an overcomplete set of nonorthogonal projectors. We derive the conditions
under which Bell's stochastic modal dynamics for projective measures reduce to
deterministic dynamics, showing (incidentally) that Brown and Hiley's
generalization of Bohmian mechanics [quant-ph/0005026, (2000)] cannot be thus
derived. We then show how {\em deterministic} dynamics for positive operators
can also be derived. As a simple case, we consider a Harmonic oscillator, and
the overcomplete set of coherent state projectors (i.e. the Husimi POM). We
show that the modal dynamics for this POM in the classical limit correspond to
the classical dynamics, even for the nonclassical number state $\ket{n}$. This
is in contrast to the Bohmian dynamics, which for energy eigenstates, the
dynamics are always non-classical.

for the temperature quadrupole and octopole anisotropies than expected in the
best fitting (concordance) Lambda-dominated cold dark matter cosmology. Some
authors have argued that this discrepancy may require new physics. Yet the
statistical significance of this result is not clear. Some authors have applied
frequentist arguments and claim that the discrepancy would occur by chance
about 1 time in 700 if the concordance model is correct. Other authors have
used Bayesian arguments to claim that the data show marginal evidence for new
physics. I investigate these confusing and apparently conflicting claims using
a frequentist analysis and a simplified Bayesian analysis. I conclude that the
WMAP results are consistent with the concordance Lambda CDM model.

a total of 130 square degrees, we have discovered nine new pulsars and detected
four previously known objects. We compare the results of this survey with those
of other 430-MHz surveys carried out at Arecibo and of an intermediate latitude
survey made at Parkes that included part of our search area; the latter
independently found two of the nine pulsars we have discovered.
  At least six of our discoveries are isolated pulsars with ages between 5 and
300 Myr; one of these, PSR J1819+1305, exhibits very marked and periodic
nulling. We have also found a recycled pulsar, PSR J2016+1948. With a
rotational period of 65 ms, this is a member of a binary system with a 635-day
orbital period. We discuss some of the the properties of this system in detail,
and indicate its potential to provide a test of the Strong Equivalence
Principle. This pulsar and PSR J0407+16, a similar system now being timed at
Arecibo, are by far the best systems known for such a test.

microlensing reasonably well reproduces the average structure function of

higher than 0.35 magnitudes and the mean amplitudes observed at redshifts below

Recent observations
suggest that radio emitting electrons are presently accelerated rather than
having been injected at early stages of the plerion evolution. The observed
flat spectra without a low frequency cutoff imply an acceleration mechanism
that raises the average particle energy by few orders of magnitude but leaves
most of the particles at the energy less than about few hundred MeV. It is
suggested that annihilation of the alternating magnetic field at the pulsar
wind termination shock provides the necessary mechanism. Toroidal stripes of
opposite magnetic polarity are formed in the wind emanated from an obliquely
rotating pulsar magnetosphere (the striped wind). At the termination shock, the
flow is compressed and the magnetic field annihilates by driven reconnection.
Jump conditions are obtained for the shock in a striped wind. It is shown that
postshock MHD parameters of the flow are the same as if the energy of
alternating field has already been converted into the plasma energy upstream
the shock. Therefore the available estimates of the ratio of the Poynting flux
to the matter energy flux, $\sigma$, should be attributed not to the total
upstream Poynting flux but only to that associated with the average magnetic
field. A simple model for the particle acceleration in the shocked striped wind
is presented.

lowest pion mass at $180 {\rm MeV}$, we observe that the masses of the first
positive and negative parity excited states of the nucleon tend to cross over
as the quark masses are taken to the chiral limit. Both results at the physical
pion mass agree with the experimental values of the Roper resonance
($N^{1/2+}(1440)$) and $S_{11}$ ($N^{1/2-}(1535)$). This is seen for the first
time in a lattice QCD calculation. These results are obtained on a quenched
Iwasaki $16^3 \times 28$ lattice with $a = 0.2 {\rm fm}$. We also extract the
ghost $\eta' N$ states (a quenched artifact) which are shown to decouple from
the nucleon interpolation field above $m_{\pi} \sim 300 {\rm MeV}$. From the
quark mass dependence of these states in the chiral region, we conclude that
spontaneously broken chiral symmetry dictates the dynamics of light quarks in
the nucleon.

may arise in a semi-quantized Yang-Mills theory, where the original gauge
group, SU(3), is reduced to a smaller gauge group, SU(2), and with some
combination of the coset fields of the SU(3) to SU(2) reduction acting as
effective scalar fields. The procedure is called semi-quantized since some of
the original gauge fields are treated as quantum degrees of freedom, while
others are postulated to be effectively described as classical degrees of
freedom. Some speculation is offer on a possible connection between these
monopole configurations and the confinement problem, and the nucleon spin
puzzle.

for quantifying the nonlocality of bipartite unitary operations. We construct a
family of unitary operators on C^n tensor C^n whose operator-Schmidt
decompositions are computed using the discrete Fourier transform. As a
corollary, we produce unitaries on C^3 tensor C^3 with operator-Schmidt number
S for every S in {1,...,9}. This corollary was unexpected, since it
contradicted reasonable conjectures of Nielsen et al [Phys. Rev. A 67 (2003)
052301] based on intuition from a striking result in the two-qubit case. By the
results of Dur, Vidal, and Cirac [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 (2002) 057901
quant-ph/0112124], who also considered the two-qubit case, our result implies
that there are nine equivalence classes of unitaries on C^3 tensor C^3 which
are probabilistically interconvertible by (stochastic) local operations and
classical communication. As another corollary, a prescription is produced for
constructing maximally-entangled operators from biunimodular functions.
Reversing tact, we state a generalized operator-Schmidt decomposition of the
quantum Fourier transform considered as an operator C^M_1 tensor C^M_2 -->
C^N_1 tensor C^N_2, with M_1 x M_2 = N_1 x N_2. This decomposition shows (by
Nielsen's bound) that the communication cost of the QFT remains maximal when a
net transfer of qudits is permitted. In an appendix, a canonical procedure is
given for removing basis-dependence for results and proofs depending on the
""magic basis"" introduced in [S. Hill and W. Wootters, ""Entanglement of a pair

{\bf 87}, 163601 (2001)). Both two- and three-dimensional rotational systems
are analyzed. It is shown that the wave function of the rotor develops a {\em
cusp} at a certain delay after a kick, which results in a sharply focused
rotational wave packet. The {\em cusp} is followed by a fold-type catastrophe
manifested in the {\em rainbow}-like moving angular singularities. In the
three-dimensional case, the rainbows are accompanied by additional singular
features similar to {\em glory} structures known in wave optics. These
catastrophes in the time-dependent angular wave function are well described by
the appropriate tools of the quasiclassical wave mechanics, i.e. by Airy and
Bessel approximations and Pearcey's functions. A scenario of ""accumulative
squeezing"" is also presented in which a specially designed train of short kicks
produces an unlimited narrowing of the rotor angular distribution. This
scenario is relevant for the molecular alignment by short laser pulses, and
also for atom lithography schemes in which cold atoms are focused by an optical
standing wave.

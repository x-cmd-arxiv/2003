According to hierarchical galaxy merger models, binary black holes should form
frequently, and should be common in the cores of galaxies. The presence of
massive black hole binaries has been invoked to explain a number of class
properties of different types of galaxies, and in triggering various forms of
activity. The search for such binary black holes is therefore of great interest
for key topics in astrophysics ranging from galaxy formation to activity in
galaxies.
  A number of phenomena were attributed to the presence of supermassive binary
black holes, including X-shaped radio galaxies and double-double radio
galaxies, helical radio-jets, periodicities in the lightcurves of blazars,
(double-horned emission-line profiles), binary galaxies with radio-jet cores,
binary quasars, and the X-ray active binary black hole at the center of the
galaxy NGC 6240. Here, I review the observational evidence for the presence of
supermassive binary black holes in galaxies, and the scenarios which have been
discussed to explain these observations.

most sensitive to soft sources in four 8'x8' regions covered by Chandra's
ACIS-S S3 CCD, we find 33 VSSs that appear to belong to M31. Fifteen VSSs have
spectral characteristics mirroring the supersoft X-ray sources studied in the
Magellanic Cloud and Milky Way ($k T_{eff} \leq 100$ eV); we therefore call
these ``classical'' supersoft sources, or simply supersoft sources (SSSs).
Eighteen VSSs may either have small (< 10%) hard components, or slightly higher
effective temperatures (but still < 350 eV). We refer to these VSSs as
quasisoft sources (QSSs). While hot white dwarf models may apply to SSSs, the
effective temperatures of QSSs are too high, unless, e.g., the radiation
emanates from only a small portion of surface. Two of the SSSs were first
detected and identified as such through ROSAT observations. One SSS and one QSS
may be identified with symbiotics, and 2 SSSs with supernova remnants. Both
SSSs and QSSs in the disk are found near star-forming regions, possibly
indicating that they are young. VSSs in the outer disk and halo are likely to
be old systems; in these regions, there are more QSSs than SSSs, which is
opposite to what is found in fields closer to the galaxy center. The largest
density of bright VSSs is in the bulge; some of the bulge sources are close
enough to the nucleus to be remnants of the tidal disruption of a giant by the
massive central black hole. By using Chandra data in combination with ROSAT and
XMM observations, we find most VSSs to be highly variable, fading from or
brightening toward detectability on time scales of months. There is evidence
for VSSs with low luminosities ($\sim 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$).

Several sources in Sombrero's halo are good candidates for SSS models in which
the accretor is a nuclear-burning white dwarf. In total, 32 X-ray sources are
associated with GCs. The majority of sources with luminosity > 1e38 erg/s are
in GCs. These results for M104, an Sa galaxy, are similar to what has been
found for elliptical galaxies and for the late-type spiral M31. We find that
those optically bright GCs with X-ray sources house only the brightest X-ray
sources. We find that, in common with other galaxies, there appears to be a
positive connection between young (metal-rich) GCs and X-ray sources, but that
the brightest X-ray sources are equally likely to be in metal-poor GCs. We
propose a model which can explain the trends seen in the data sets from the
Sombrero and other galaxies. Thermal-time scale mass transfer can occur in some
of the the younger clusters in which the turn-off mass is slightly greater than

cosmology, a model of two populations of lens halos for strong gravitational
lensing can reproduce the results of the Jodrell-Bank VLA Astrometric Survey

model, lensing probabilities are sensitive to three parameters: the
concentration parameter $c_1$, the cooling mass scale $M_\mathrm{c}$ and the
value of the CDM power spectrum normalization parameter $\sigma_8$. The value
ranges of these parameters are constrained by various observations. However, we
found that predicted lensing probabilities are also quite sensitive to the flux
density (brightness) ratio $q_{\mathrm{r}}$ of the multiple lensing images,
which has been, in fact, a very important selection criterion of a sample in
any lensing survey experiments. We re-examine the above mentioned model by
considering the flux ratio and galactic central Super Massive Black Holes

$M_\mathrm{c}$ in fitting the predicted lensing probabilities to JVAS/CLASS

uncertainty in $M_\mathrm{c}$ must be resolved. The effects of SMBHs cannot be
detected by strong gravitational lensing method when $q_{\mathrm{r}}\leq 10$.

ultra-luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240, with the aim of investigating whether
star cluster properties (luminosity, age and mass) in such an extreme

We found 54 star clusters in all of the F450W, F547M and F814W exposures, of
which 41 are located in the main body of NGC 6240 and 13 in the galactic tails.
Given that only two colours are available to derive two independent variables
(cluster reddening and age), we adopted an ad hoc procedure to statistically
derive cluster parameters under the assumption that the cluster metallicity is
LMC-like. The colours of each cluster are fitted to STARBURST99 models of fixed
mass and variable ages and reddenings. All cluster reddening and age solutions
with Chi squared < 1 are considered to be consistent with the data. Masses are
derived by scaling the luminosity of the models with best-fit Chi squared < 1
by the observed V luminosity, after correction for reddening and distance. We
infer that the most probable age of the observed clusters is (5 - 13) Myr and
their most probable mass is about (1 - 2)e05 solar masses. Comparison with star
clusters in starburst galaxies seems to point to more massive clusters being
formed in more massive galaxies and gas-rich mergers, while the overall cluster
mass distribution might be relatively independent of the details of the
associated starburst where dense, massive clusters preferentially form.

observations the X-ray absorption toward pre-main sequence stars (PMS) without
accretion disks (i.e., Class III sources) to obtain the total hydrogen column
density N_{H,X}. For these sources we take from the literature the
corresponding dust extinction in the near-infrared, A_J, or when unavailable we
derive it from SED fitting using the available DENIS, 2MASS, ISOCAM and other
data. We then compare N_{H,X} and A_J for each object, up to unprecedently high
extinction. For the rho Oph dark cloud with a relatively large sample of 20
bona-fide Class III sources, we probe the extinction up to A_J <~ 14 (A_V <~
45), and find a best-fit linear relation N_{H,X}/A_J = 5.6 (+/- 0.4)x10^{21}
cm^{-2} mag^{-1}, adopting standard ISM abundances. The other regions reveal a
large dispersion in the N_{H,X}/A_J ratio for each source but for lack of
adequate IR data these studies remain limited to moderate extinctions (A_J <~
1.5 or A_V <~5). For rho Oph, the N_{H,X}/A_J ratio is significantly lower (>~2
sigma) than the galactic value, derived using the standard extinction curve
(R_V = 3.1). This result is consistent with the recent downwards revision of
the metallicity of the Sun and stars in the solar vicinity. We find that the
rho Oph dense cloud has the same metallicity than the local ISM when assuming
that the galactic gas-to-dust ratio remains unchanged. The difference between
galactic and local values of the gas-to-dust ratio can thus be attributed
entirely to a difference in metallicity.

inclination and phase. At or near conjunction, the lines have approximately
Gaussian profiles, with small widths (HWHM ~ 0.1 v_\infty) and definite blue-
or redshifts (depending on whether the star with the weaker wind is in front or
behind). When the system is viewed at quadrature, the lines are generally much
broader (HWHM ~ v_\infty), flat-topped and unshifted. Local absorption can have
a major effect on the observed profiles - in systems with mass-loss rates of a
few times 10^{-6} Msol/yr the lower energy lines (E <~ 1 kev) are particularly
affected. This generally results in blueward-skewed profiles, especially when
the system is viewed through the dense wind of the primary. The orbital
variation of the line widths and shifts is reduced in a low inclination binary.

Navier-Stokes equation. It has been found that at least for the transonic
solution, viscosity acts as a mechanism that detracts from the effectiveness of
gravity. This has been conjectured to set up a limiting scale of length for
gravity to bring about accretion, and the physical interpretation of such a
length-scale has been compared with the conventional understanding of the
so-called ""accretion radius"" for spherically symmetric accretion. For a
perturbative presence of viscosity, it has also been pointed out that the
critical points for inflows and outflows are not identical, which is a
consequence of the fact that under the Navier-Stokes prescription, there is a
breakdown of the invariance of the stationary inflow and outflow solutions --
an invariance that holds good under inviscid conditions. For inflows, the
critical point gets shifted deeper within the gravitational potential well.
Finally, a linear stability analysis of the stationary inflow solutions, under
the influence of a perturbation that is in the nature of a standing wave, has
indicated that the presence of viscosity induces greater stability in the
system, than has been seen for the case of inviscid spherically symmetric
inflows.

energy spectrum increases with wavenumber and peaks at the resistive cutoff
wavenumber. It has previously been argued that even in the dynamical case the
magnetic energy peaks at the resistive scale. Using high resolution simulations
(up to 1024^3 meshpoints) with no large scale imposed field we show that the
magnetic energy peaks at a wavenumber that is independent of the magnetic
Reynolds number and about 5 times larger than the forcing wavenumber.
Throughout the inertial range the spectral magnetic energy exceeds the kinetic
energy by a factor of 2 to 3. Both spectra are approximately parallel. The
total energy spectrum seems to be close to k^{-3/2}, but there is a strong
bottleneck effect and it is suggested that the asymptotic spectrum is instead
k^{-5/3}. This is supported by the value of the second order structure function
exponent that is found to be zeta_2=0.70, suggesting a k^{-1.70} spectrum. The
third order structure function scaling exponent is very close to unity, in
agreement with Goldreich-Sridhar theory.
  Adding an imposed field tends to suppress the small scale magnetic field. We
find that at large scales the magnetic power spectrum follows then a k^{-1}
slope. When the strength of the imposed field is of the same order as the
dynamo generated field, we find almost equipartition between the magnetic and
kinetic power spectra.

flux densities of different frequency pairs worsen as the frequency separation
widens and also tend to be worse for outer profile components. The single pulse

However, the spectral index distributions for the single pulses of PSR B1133+16
show significant deviations from a Gaussian. This asymmetry is caused by very
strong pulses with flux densities exceeding the mean value by more than a
factor of ten. These strong pulses occur preferentially at the trailing edge of
the leading component and appear to be broadband in most cases. Their
properties are similar to those of so-called giant pulses, suggesting that
these phenomena are related.

IC 1613. The photometry is the deepest to date for an isolated dwarf irregular
galaxy. The resulting color-magnitude diagram (CMD) is analyzed using three
different methods to derive a star formation history (SFH). All three find an
enhanced star formation rate (SFR), from 3 to 6 Gyr ago, and similar
age-metallicity relationships (AMR). A comparison of the newly observed outer
field with an earlier studied central field of IC 1613 shows that the SFR in
the outer field has been significantly depressed during the last Gyr. This
implies that the optical scale length of the galaxy has been decreasing with
time and that comparison of galaxies at intermediate redshift with present day
galaxies should take this effect into account. We find strong similarities
between IC 1613 and the more distant Milky Way dSph companions in that all are
dominated by star formation at intermediate ages. In particular, the SFH and
AMR for IC 1613 and Leo I are indistinguishable. This implies that dIrr
galaxies cannot be distinguished from dSphs by their intermediate age stellar
populations. This type of a SFH may also be evidence for slower or suppressed
early star formation in dwarf galaxies due to photoionization after the
reionization of the universe by background radiation. Assuming that IC 1613 is
typical of a dIrr evolving in isolation, since most of the star formation
occurs at intermediate ages, these dwarf systems cannot be responsible for the
fast chemical enrichment of the IGM which is seen at high redshift. There is no
evidence for any large amplitude bursts of star formation in IC 1613, and we
find it highly unlikely that analogs of IC 1613 have contributed to the excess
of faint blue galaxies in existing galaxy redshift surveys.

ChaI at small separations. Upper limits for the mass Msini of possible

However, two very low-mass stars in ChaI show significant RV variations. The
nature of these variations is still unclear. If caused by orbiting objects the
recorded variability amplitudes would correspond to planets of the order of a
few Jupiter masses.
  Furthermore, as a by-product of the RV survey for companions, we have studied
the kinematics of the brown dwarfs in ChaI. Precise kinematic studies of young
brown dwarfs are interesting in the context of the question if brown dwarfs are
formed by the recently proposed ejection scenario. We have found that the RV

inner carbon site from the inversion center is halved. This indicates that the
charge transfer (disproportionation) occurs from one inner carbon site to the
other inner site exclusively within one unit cell triggered by anion ordering.
The 1/T_1 for the charge-donating inner site shows activated temperature
dependence below T_AO, although 1/T_1 for the outer carbon decreases much more
moderately in lowering temperature as has been discussed in weakly interacting
one dimensional conductors. Our observation of the local gap for the spin
excitation generated by anion ordering is consistent with the simple model
assuming only the electrostatic interaction between the inner carbon sites and
ordered anions, which is known to be much closer to the inner sites than to the
outer sites. Nevertheless, we reveal that only the electrostatic interaction
between the anions and molecules is insufficient to reproduce the observed
divergence of the frequency shift and the linewidth of the inhomogeneous line
stemming from the charge-accepting inner site at a much lower temperature than

reaction. A new recurrent equation of quark masses is obtained and the model of
harmonic quark family is developed. The quark masses in the model are bound
together into one rigid chain. With the electromagnetic contribution taken into
account the quark masses are calculated with the 0.03 percent inaccuracy. It
follows from the model that the muon is a single u-quark mass state fixed as a
lepton. The neutral pion is probably a stable harmonic oscillator based on a
quark-antiquark u-pair.

unique advantages of the gPSM approach can be exploited for the latter: We are

in the limit of large values of the pairing strength $G$ and yields the number
of pairs not developing a collective behaviour, their energy remaining finite
in the $G\to\infty$ limit. We express analytically, through the moments of the
single particle levels distribution, the collective mode energy and the two
critical values $G_{\rm cr}^{+}$ and $G_{\rm cr}^{-}$ of the coupling which can
exist on a single particle level with no pair degeneracy. Notably $G_{\rm
cr}^{+}$ and $G_{\rm cr}^{-}$ merge when the number of single particle levels
goes to infinity, where they coincide with the $G_{\rm cr}$ (when it exists) of
a one pair system, not envisioned by the Richardson theory. In correspondence
of $G_{\rm cr}$ the system undergoes a transition from a mean field to a
pairing dominated regime. We finally explore the behaviour of the excitation
energies, wave functions and pair transfer amplitudes finding out that the
former, for $G>G_{\rm cr}^{-}$, come close to the BCS predictions, whereas the
latter display a divergence at $G_{\rm cr}$, signaling the onset of a long

$\pi^+ \pi^-$ atom, to better than 3% precision. The goal of the DIRAC
experiment at CERN is to obtain and check this value experimentally by
measuring the break-up probability of pionium in a target. In order to
accurately measure the lifetime one needs to know the relationship between the
break-up probability and lifetime to a 1% accuracy. We have obtained this
dependence by modeling the evolution of pionic atoms in the target using Monte
Carlo methods. The model relies on the computation of the pionium--target atom
interaction cross sections. Three different sets of pionium--target cross
sections with varying degrees of complexity were used: from the simplest first
order Born approximation involving only the electrostatic interaction to a more
advanced approach taking into account multi-photon exchanges and relativistic
effects. We conclude that in order to obtain the pionium lifetime to 1%
accuracy from the break-up probability, the pionium--target cross sections must
be known with the same accuracy for the low excited bound states of the pionic
atom. This result has been achieved, for low $Z$ targets, with the two most
precise cross section sets. For large $Z$ targets only the set accounting for
multiphoton exchange satisfies the condition.

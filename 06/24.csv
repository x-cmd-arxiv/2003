complicated by a strong Galactic foreground. Estimates of the EGRB flux and
spectrum, obtained by modeling the Galactic emission, have produced a variety
of (sometimes conflicting) results. The latest analysis of the EGRET data found
an isotropic flux I_x=1.45+-0.05 above 100 MeV, in units of 10^-5 s^-1 cm^-2
sr^-1. We analyze the EGRET data in search for robust constraints on the EGRB
flux, finding the gamma-ray sky strongly dominated by Galactic foreground even
at high latitudes, with no conclusive evidence for an additional isotropic
component. The gamma-ray intensity measured towards the Galactic poles is
similar to or lower than previous estimates of I_x. The high latitude profile
of the gamma-ray data is disk-like for 40<|b[deg]|<70, and even steeper for
|b|>70; overall it exhibits strong Galactic features and is well fit by a
simple Galactic model. Based on the |b|>40 data we find that I_x<0.5 at a 99%
confidence level, with evidence for a much lower flux. We show that
correlations with Galactic tracers, previously used to identify the Galactic
foreground and estimate I_x, are not satisfactory; the results depend on the
tracers used and on the part of the sky examined, because the Galactic emission
is not linear in the Galactic tracers and exhibits spectral variations across
the sky. The low EGRB flux favored by our analysis places stringent limits on
extragalactic scenarios involving gamma-ray emission, such as radiation from
blazars, intergalactic shocks and production of ultra-high energy cosmic rays
and neutrinos. We suggest methods by which future gamma-ray missions such as
GLAST and AGILE could indirectly identify the EGRB.

ksec Chandra HETGS spectrum of NGC 3783. The analysis was carried out with
PHASE a new tool designed to model X-ray and UV absorption features in ionized
plasmas. The 0.5-10 keV intrinsic continuum of the source is well represented
by a single power law (Gamma=1.53) and a soft black-body component (kT=10 keV).
The spectrum contains over 100 features, which are well fit by PHASE with just
six free parameters. The model consists of a simple two phase absorber with
difference of 35 in the ionization parameter and difference of 4 in the column
density of the phases. The two absorption components turned out to be in
pressure equilibrium, and are consistent with a single outflow (750 kms-1) an a
single turbulent velocity (300 km s-1), and with solar elemental abundances.
The main features of the low ionization phase are an Fe M-shell unresolved
transition array (UTA) and the OVII lines. The OVII features, usualy identified
with the OVIII and a warm absorber, are instead produced in a cooler medium
also producing OVI lines. The UTA sets tight constraints on the ionization
degree of the absorbers, making the model more reliable. The high ionization
phase is required by the OVII and the Fe L-shell lines, and there is evidence
for an even more ionized component in the spectrum. A continuous range of
ionization parameters is disfavored by the fits, particularly to the UTA. The
low ionizaton phase can be decomposed into three subcomponents based on the
outflow velocity, FWHM, and H column densities found for three out of the four
UV absorbers detected in NGC 3783. However, the ionization parametes are
systematically smaller in our model than derived from UV data, indicating a
lower degree of ionization.

ratios of about 70% and higher. We present a formalism for expanding the PSF to
arbitrary order in terms of powers of the Fourier transform of the residual
phase error, over an arbitrarily shaped and apodized entrance aperture. For
traditional unapodized apertures at high Strehl ratios, bright speckles pinned
to the bright Airy rings are part of an antisymmetric perturbation of the
perfect PSF, arising from the term that is first order in the residual phase
error. There are two symmetric second degree terms. One is negative at the
center, and, like the first order term, is modulated by the perfect image's
field strength -- it reduces to the Marechal approximation at the center of the
PSF. The other is non-negative everywhere, zero at the image center, and can be
responsible for an extended halo -- which limits the dynamic range of faint
companion detection in the darkest portions of the image. In regimes where one
or the other term dominates the speckles in an image, the symmetry of the
dominant term can be exploited to reduce the effect of those speckles,
potentially by an order of magnitude or more. We demonstrate the effects of
both secondary obscuration and pupil apodization on the structure of residual
speckles, and discuss how these symmetries can be exploited by appropriate

as a function of redshift z and overdensity delta. Using a hydrodynamical
simulation to link the H I absorption to the density and temperature of the
absorbing gas, and a model for the UV background radiation, we convert ratios
of C IV to H I pixel optical depths into carbon abundances. A careful analysis
of 19 high-quality quasar absorption spectra reveals that the carbon abundance
is spatially highly inhomogeneous and is well-described by a lognormal
distribution for fixed delta and z. Using data in the range log(delta) = -0.5 -
1.8 and z = 1.8 - 4.1, and a renormalized version of the Haardt & Madau (2001)
model for the UV background radiation from galaxies and quasars, we measure a
median metallicity of [C/H] = -3.47 + 0.08(z-3) + 0.65[log(delta)-0.5] and a
lognormal scatter of sigma([C/H]) = 0.76 + 0.02(z-3) - 0.23[log(delta)-0.5].
Thus, we find significant trends with overdensity, but no evidence for
evolution. These measurements imply that gas in this density range accounts for
a cosmic carbon abundance of [C/H] = -2.80 +/- 0.13 (Omega_C = 2e-7), with no
evidence for evolution. The dominant source of systematic error is the spectral
shape of the UV background, with harder spectra yielding higher carbon
abundances. While the systematic errors due to uncertainties in the spectral
hardness may exceed the quoted statistical errors for delta < 10, we stress
that UV backgrounds that differ significantly from our fiducial model give
unphysical results. The measured lognormal scatter is strictly independent of
the spectral shape, provided the background radiation is uniform. We also
present measurements of the C III/C IV ratio (which rule out collisional
ionization) and of the evolution of the effective Lyman-alpha optical depth.

disturbances, the cloud is lifted up by the pressure of MHD waves and reaches a
steady-state characterized by oscillations about a new time-averaged
equilibrium state. The nonlinear effect results in the generation of
longitudinal motions and many shock waves; however, the wave kinetic energy
remains predominantly in transverse, rather than longitudinal, motions. There
is an approximate equipartition of energy between the transverse velocity and
fluctuating magnetic field (aspredicted by small-amplitude theory) in the

relation breaks down in the outer regions, particularly near the cloud surface,

modified in such regions. Models of an ensemble of clouds show that, for
various strengths of the input energy, the velocity dispersion in the cloud

galaxies selected morphologically in the redshift range 0.56<z<1.02 in the
HDF-N. Using velocity dispersions determined from the Keck spectra in
conjunction with structural parameters measured from the deep WFPC2 images we
study the evolution of the M/L_B ratio and the fundamental plane (FP) with
redshift. For the majority of galaxies the trends observed are very similar to
those determined earlier for rich clusters. The systematic offset between HDF-N
galaxies and cluster galaxies is d(ln M/L_B) = -0.14 +- 0.13, corresponding to
an age difference of only 16 +- 15 % at <z>=0.88. However, we find enhanced H
delta absorption of equivalent width 4.0 Angstrom in the mean spectrum of the
ten galaxies, indicating the presence of young stars. We infer that the
galaxies have composite stellar populations, consisting of a low mass young
component in addition to a dominating old component. As the bulk of the stellar
mass must have formed at z >~ 2 our results argue against formation scenarios
involving major mergers of gas-rich disk systems at 1<z<1.5, and we conclude
that z~1 early-type galaxies were either assembled at higher redshift or in
mergers involving little gas. The ubiquitous enhanced Balmer lines and the
presence of tidal features in two of the galaxies lend some support to the
latter hypothesis. The main uncertainty in the analysis is the small sample;
larger samples are needed to study the interplay between the evolution of
stellar populations and morphology in detail.

low magnetization results in density profiles that behave as rho ~ r^{-4} at
large radii, and at high magnetization we find density profiles that behave as
rho ~ r^{-2}. This density behaviour is the same as for hydrostatic filamentary
structures, suggesting that density measurements alone cannot distinguish
between hydrostatic and collapsing filaments--velocity measurements are
required. Our solutions show that the self-similar radial velocity behaves as
v_r ~ r during the collapse phase, and that unlike collapsing self-similar
spheres, there is no subsequent accretion (i.e. expansion-wave) phase. We also
examine the fragmentation properties of these cylinders, and find that in both

fragmentation. Finally, the collapse time scales in our models are shorter than
the fragmentation time scales. Thus, we anticipate that highly collapsed
filaments can form before they are broken into pieces by gravitational
fragmentation.

have been frozen solid for most of its existence. Yet, running water is
observed to have been present since very early in Earth's history. This enigma
is known as the faint sun paradox. We show here that it can be partially
resolved once we consider the cooling effect that cosmic rays are suspected to
have on the global climate and that the younger sun must have had a stronger
solar wind, such that it was more effective at stopping cosmic rays from
reaching Earth. The paradox can then be completely resolved with the further
contribution of modest greenhouse gas warming. When we add the cosmic ray flux
modulation by a variable star formation rate in the Milky Way, we recover the
long term glacial activity on Earth. As to the future, we find that the average

events. Globular clusters typically have very high stellar densities where
close encounters are relatively common, and thus tidal capture can occur to
form close binary systems. Encounters between main sequence stars and
lower-mass objects can result in tidal capture if the mass ratio is > 0.01. If
brown dwarfs exist in significant numbers, they too will be found in close
binaries, and some fraction of their number should be revealed as they transit
their stellar companions. We calculate the rate of tidal capture of brown
dwarfs in both segregated and unsegregated clusters, and find that the tidal
capture is more likely to occur over an initial relaxation time before
equipartition occurs. The lack of any such transits in recent HST monitoring of
47 Tuc implies an upper limit on the frequency of brown dwarfs (< 15 % relative

scatterings of the highly relativistic quarks in a dense medium (the

nearby interactions, the bremsstrahlung emissivity from strange star surface is
suppressed for frequencies smaller than a critical frequency. The range of the
suppressed frequencies is a function of the quark matter density at the star's
surface and of the QCD coupling constant. For temperatures much smaller than
the Fermi energy of the quarks the bremsstrahlung spectrum has the same
temperature dependence as the equilibrium black body radiation. Multiple
collisions could reduce the intensity of the bremsstrahlung radiation by an
order of magnitude. The effect of the thin electron layer at the surface of the

shown that absorption in the semi-degenerate electron gas can also
significantly reduce the intensity of the quark-quark bremsstrahlung radiation

0.2<z_abs<3.7. All three samples separately yield consistent, significant

ions/transitions with very different dependencies on alpha, yet they also give
consistent results. We identify additional random errors in 22 high-z systems
characterized by transitions with a large dynamic range in apparent optical
depth. Increasing the statistical errors on da/a for these systems gives our
fiducial result, a weighted mean da/a=(-0.543+/-0.116)x10^-5, representing
4.7-sigma evidence for a smaller weighted mean alpha in the absorption clouds.
Assuming that da/a=0 at z_abs=0, the data marginally prefer a linear increase
in alpha with time: dota/a=(6.40+/-1.35)x10^-16 yr^-1. The two-point
correlation function for alpha is consistent with zero over 0.2-13 Gpc comoving
scales and the angular distribution of da/a shows no significant dipolar
anisotropy. We therefore have no evidence for spatial variations in da/a. We
extend our previous searches for possible systematic errors, identifying
atmospheric dispersion and isotopic structure effects as potentially the most
significant. However, overall, known systematic errors do not explain the
results. Future many-multiplet analyses of QSO spectra from different

interpreted on the base of the galactic wind scenario for elliptical galaxies.
In this framework, we develop a toy-model to follow the chemical evolution of
the ICM, formulated in analogy to chemical models for individual galaxies. The
model computes the galaxy formation history (GFH) of cluster galaxies,
connecting the final luminosity function (LF) to the corresponding metal
enrichment history of the ICM. The observed LF can be reproduced with a smooth,
Madau-plot like GFH peaking at z~ 1-2, plus a ""burst"" of formation of dwarf
galaxies at high redshift. The model is used to test the response of the
predicted metal content and abundance evolution of the ICM to varying input
galactic models. The chemical enrichment is computed from ""galactic yields""
based on models of elliptical galaxies with a variable initial mass function
(IMF), favouring the formation of massive stars at high redshift and/or in more
massive galaxies. For a given final galactic luminosity, these model
ellipticals eject into the ICM a larger quantity of gas and of metals than do
standard models based on the Salpeter IMF. However, a scenario in which the IMF
varies with redshift as a consequence of the effect of the the cosmic
background temperature on the Jeans mass scale, appears to be too mild to
account for the observed metal production in clusters. The high
iron-mass-to-luminosity-ratio of the ICM can be reproduced only by assuming a
more dramatic variation of the typical stellar mass, in line with other recent
findings. The mass in the wind-ejected gas is predicted to exceed the mass in
galaxies by a factor of 1.5-2 and to constitute roughly half of the
intra-cluster gas.

accretion disk and jet. Hence, independent observational constraints are
required to resolve related issues. We explore the possibility of using the
observational data of the star S2, currently closest to the Galactic center, to
distinguish physical models for the radio emission of the Sagittarius $ {\rm

with the orbital parameters derived from the observation. The relative
difference in the electron temperature due to the stellar cooling from the star
S2 at the pericenter is a few parts of a thousand and the consequent relative
radio luminosity difference is order of $10^{-4}$. Therefore, one could
possibly expect to observe the radio flux variation with a periodic or
quasi-periodic modulation in the frequency range at $\nu \la {\rm 100 MHz}$ if
the radiatively inefficient hot accretion flows are indeed responsible for the
radio emission, contrary to the case of a jet. According to our findings, even
though no periodic radio flux variations have been reported up to date a
radiatively inefficient hot accretion disk model cannot be conclusively ruled

accretion driven by a bar. The equivalent widths of the Calcium triplet lines

dynamics, we first provide results of computer simulations for the
spatio-temporal evolution of the opinion distribution $L(t)$, the evolution of
magnetization $m(t)$, the distribution of decision times $P(\tau)$ and
relaxation times $P(\mu)$. In the main part of the paper, it is shown that the
SM can be completely reformulated in terms of a linear VM, where the transition
rates towards a given opinion are directly proportional to frequency of the
respective opinion of the second-nearest neighbors (no matter what the nearest
neighbors are). So, the SM dynamics can be reduced to one rule, ``Just follow
your second-nearest neighbor''. The equivalence is demonstrated by extensive
computer simulations that show the same behavior between SM and VM in terms of
$L(t)$, $m(t)$, $P(\tau)$, $P(\mu)$, and the final attractor statistics. The
reformulation of the SM in terms of a VM involves a new parameter $\sigma$, to
bias between anti- and ferromagnetic decisions in the case of frustration. We
show that $\sigma$ plays a crucial role in explaining the phase transition
observed in SM. We further explore the role of synchronous versus asynchronous
update rules on the intermediate dynamics and the final attractors. Compared to
the original SM, we find three additional attractors, two of them related to an
asymmetric coexistence between the opposite opinions.

have theoretically studied the behavior of the optical bandedge in diluted

exchange-spitting $\mit\Delta E_{ex} $ and the averaged magnetization $|x < S_z

offset. Furthermore, the present study reveals that in the low dilution of
Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$As the optical bandedge exists not at the bandedge of the
impurity band but near the bottom of host band. The optical bandedge behaves as
if the exchange interaction is ferromagnetic although the antiferromagnetic
exchange interaction actually operates at Mn site. We conclude that the
spin-dependent shift of the carrier states between the impurity band and host
band accompanying with the change of magnetization causes the apparently
ferromagnetic behavior of the optical bandedge which was reported in the
magnetoreflection measurement of Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$As.

hydrophilic, and neutral residues, respectively. The 46-residue BLN protein is
folded into the native state of a four-stranded beta-barrel. It has been a
challenging problem to locate the global minimum of the 46-residue BLN protein
since the system is highly frustrated and consequently its energy landscape is
quite rugged. The CSA successfully located the global minimum of the 46-mer for
all 100 independent runs. The CPU time for CSA is about seventy times less than
that for simulated annealing (SA), and its success rate (100 %) to find the
global minimum is about eleven times higher. The amount of computational
efforts used for CSA is also about ten times less than that of the best global
optimization method yet applied to the 46-residue BLN protein, the quantum
thermal annealing with renormalization. The 100 separate CSA runs produce the
global minimum 100 times as well as other 5950 final conformations
corresponding to a total of 2361 distinct local minima of the protein. Most of
the final conformations have relatively small RMSD values from the global
minimum, independent of their diverse energy values. Very close to the global
minimum, there exist quasi-global-minima which are frequently obtained as one
of the final answers from SA runs. We find that there exist two largest energy
gaps between the quasi-global-minima and the other local minima. Once a SA run
is trapped in one of these quasi-global-minima, it cannot be folded into the
global minimum before crossing over the two large energy barriers, clearly
demonstrating the reason for the poor success rate of SA.

Here we examine why. A criterion known as CAR (``coarsening at random'') in the
statistical literature characterizes when ``naive'' conditioning in a naive

provide a procedural characterization of it, by giving a randomized algorithm
that generates all and only distributions for which CAR holds. This
substantially extends previous characterizations of CAR. We also consider more
generalized notions of update such as Jeffrey conditioning and minimizing
relative entropy (MRE). We give a generalization of the CAR condition that
characterizes when Jeffrey conditioning leads to appropriate answers, and show
that there exist some very simple settings in which MRE essentially never gives
the right results. This generalizes and interconnects previous results obtained
in the literature on CAR and MRE.

  Through Artificial Neural Network","8 pages including 3 figures",,,"IET-MED-2003-2","cs.NE",,"  In the present paper a newer application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
has been developed i.e., predicting response-function results of
electrical-mechanical system through ANN. This method is specially useful to
complex systems for which it is not possible to find the response-function
because of complexity of the system. The proposed approach suggests that how
even without knowing the response-function, the response-function results can
be predicted with the use of ANN to the system. The steps used are: (i)
Depending on the system, the ANN-architecture and the input & output parameters
are decided, (ii) Training & test data are generated from simplified circuits
and through tactic-superposition of it for complex circuits, (iii) Training the
ANN with training data through many cycles and (iv) Test-data are used for
predicting the response-function results. It is found that the proposed novel
method for response prediction works satisfactorily. Thus this method could be
used specially for complex systems where other methods are unable to tackle it.
In this paper the application of ANN is particularly demonstrated to
electrical-circuit system but can be applied to other systems too.

quantities of interest, like the mutual information. The Bayesian treatment of
unknown chances involves computing, from a second order prior distribution and
the data likelihood, a posterior distribution of the chances. A common
treatment of incomplete data is to assume ignorability and determine the
chances by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The two different
methods above are well established but typically separated. This paper joins
the two approaches in the case of Dirichlet priors, and derives efficient
approximations for the mean, mode and the (co)variance of the chances and the
mutual information. Furthermore, we prove the unimodality of the posterior
distribution, whence the important property of convergence of EM to the global
maximum in the chosen framework. These results are applied to the problem of
selecting features for incremental learning and naive Bayes classification. A
fast filter based on the distribution of mutual information is shown to
outperform the traditional filter based on empirical mutual information on a
number of incomplete real data sets.

examination is not restricted to the Prisoner's Dilemma, but includes the other

its superiority according to these criteria. Indeed, the Prisoner's Dilemma is
unique in providing the simplest support for reciprocal cooperation, and
additive kin-selected altruism. However, care is still required in choosing the
particular Prisoner's Dilemma payoff matrix to use. This paper reviews the
impact of non-linear payoffs for the application of Hamilton's rule to typical

paper is to verify whether that intuition is correct. If one can extend a so
called Kundt metric, in such a way that its null, shear-free surfaces have
spherical spacetime sections, the resulting spacetime is foliated by so called
non-expanding horizons. The obstacle is Kundt's constraint induced at the
surfaces by the Einstein or the Einstein-Maxwell equations, and the requirement
that a solution be globally defined on the sphere. We derived a transformation
(reflection) that creates a solution to Kundt's constraint out of data defining
an extremal isolated horizon. Using that transformation, we derived a class of
exact solutions to the Einstein or Einstein-Maxwell equations of very special
properties. Each spacetime we construct is foliated by a family of the Killing
horizons. Moreover, it admits another, transversal Killing horizon. The
intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the transversal Killing horizon coincides
with the one defined on the event horizon of the extremal Kerr-Newman solution.
However, the Killing horizon in our example admits yet another Killing vector
tangent to and null at it. The geometries of the leaves are given by the
reflection.

of the quanta of electric and magnetic flux of force of the electron, and
provides a new representation, which is global across all unit systems.
Consequently, a variation in alpha was shown to manifest due to a differential
change in the fraction of the quanta of electric and magnetic flux of force,
while a variation in hcross.c was shown to manifest due to the common mode
change. The representation is discussed with respect to the running of the fine
structure constant at high energies (small distances), and a putative temporal
drift. It is shown that the running of the fine structure constant is due to
equal components of electric screening (polarization of vacuum) and magnetic
anti-screening (magnetization of vacuum), which cause the perceived quanta of
electric charge to increase at small distances, while the magnetic flux quanta
decreases. This introduces the concept of the bare magnetic flux quanta as well
as the bare electric charge. With regards to temporal drift, it is confirmed
that it is impossible to determine which fundamental constant is varying if
alpha varies.

has been developed on fans. In the first one, one tried to present everything
on an elementary level,using only some commutative algebra and no derived
categories. There remained two major gaps:
  First of all the Hard Lefschetz Theorem was only conjectured and secondly the
intersection product seemed to depend on some non-canonical choices. Meanwhile
the Hard Lefschetz theorem has been proved by Karu. The proof relies heavily on
the intersection product, since what finally has to be shown are the
Hodge-Riemann relations. In fact here again choices enter: The intersection
product is induced from the intersection product on some simplicial subdivision
via a direct embedding of the corresponding intersection cohomology sheaves, a
fact, which makes the argumentation quite involved. In a recent paper by
Bressler and Lunts, one shows by a detailed analysis that eventually all
possible choices do not affect the definition of the pairing.
  Our goal here is the same, but we shall try to follow the spirit of the first
cited paper avoiding the formalism of derived categories. For perverse sheaves
we define their dual sheaf and check that the intersection cohomology sheaf is
self- dual in a natural way.

detecting whether eavesdropping has occurred, and further relies on the fact
that information contained in the encrypted quantum state cannot be fully

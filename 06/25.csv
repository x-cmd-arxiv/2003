(Kilkenny et al, 1997), observational efforts have tried to realize their
potential for constraining the interior physics of extreme horizontal branch
(EHB) stars. Difficulties encountered along the way include uncertain mode
identifications and a lack of stable pulsation mode properties. Here we report
on Feige~48, an sdBV star for which follow-up observations have been obtained
spanning more than four years, which shows some stable pulsation modes.
  We resolve the temporal spectrum into five stable pulsation periods in the
range 340 to 380 seconds with amplitudes less then 1%, and two additional
periods that appear in one dataset each. The three largest amplitude
periodicities are nearly equally spaced, and we explore the consequences of
identifying them as a rotationally split $\ell=1$ triplet by consulting with a
representative stellar model.
  The general stability of the pulsation amplitudes and phases allows us to use
the pulsation phases to constrain the timescale of evolution for this sdBV
star. Additionally, we are able to place interesting limits on any stellar or
planetary companion to Feige~48.

relies on a sample of ~3600 galaxies from the Calar Alto Deep Imaging
  Survey (CADIS). The redshift distribution extends to z~1.1, with formal
errors of sigma_z~0.02. Thus the amplitude of the three-dimensional correlation
function can be estimated by means of the projected correlation function
w(r_p). We developed a new method to overcome the influence of redshift errors
on w(r_p). We parametrise the evolution of the clustering strength with
redshift by a parameter q, the values of which give directly the deviation of
the evolution from the global Hubble flow. From a subsample of bright galaxies
we find q=-2.28+-0.31 for Omega_m=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7, that is a significant
growth of the clustering strength between z=1 and the present epoch. From
linear theory of dark matter clustering growth one would only expect q=-2.
Moreover, we establish that the measured clustering strength depends on galaxy
type: galaxies with early type SEDs (Hubble type: E0 to Sbc) are more strongly
clustered at redshifts z>0.2 than later types. The evolution of the amplitude
of the two-point correlation function for these ``old'' galaxies is much slower
(q=-0.85+-0.82 for Omega_m=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7).

Galaxy clustering is observed to increase with luminosity, so the inferred
density field is effectively multiplied by an increasing function of radius.
This has the potential to distort the shape of the recovered power spectrum. In
this paper we present an extension of the FKP analysis method to incorporate
this effect, and present revised optimal weights to maximize the precision of

thermal structure, and the dynamics of such flows. Moderate shielding is
especially efficient in accelerating flows to high velocities since it
suppresses the ionization level of the gas. The ionization structure of
shielded gas tends to be distributed uniformly over a wide range of ionization
levels. In such gas, radiation pressure due to trapped line photons can
dominate over the thermal gas pressure and have a significant effect on the
thermal stability of the flow. Heavily shielded flows are driven mainly by line
radiation pressure, and so line locking has a large effect on the flow
dynamics. We show that the observed ``L_\alpha ghost'' is a natural outcome in
highly ionized flows that are shielded beyond the Lyman limit. We suggest that
high velocity AGN flows occupy only a small fraction of the volume and that

Using echelle spectra from the Magellan Baade 6.5-meter telescope, we confirm
the pre-main sequence status and cluster membership of the substellar
candidates, through the detection of LiI, NaI consistent with low gravity, and
radial velocity. Given their late spectral type (~M8) and the youth of the
association (age ~10Myr), cluster membership certifies these three objects as
very low-mass young brown dwarfs. One of them (2MASS 1207-3932) shows strong
emission both in the Hydrogen Balmer series (H_alpha to H_epsilon) and in HeI
(4471, 5876, 6678 and 7065 A), compared to other young brown dwarfs of similar
spectral type. The H_alpha line is also relatively broad (10% width ~200 km/s)
and asymmetric. These characteristics suggest that 2MASS 1207-3932 is a (weak)
accretor. While we cannot rule out activity, comparison to a flaring field
dwarf implies that such activity would have to be quite anomalous. The
verification of accretion would make 2MASS 1207-3932 the oldest actively
accreting brown dwarf known to date, suggesting that inner disk lifetimes in
substellar objects can be comparable to those in stars, consistent with a
similar formation mechanism. Finally, TWA 5A appears to be a variable accretor:
observations separated by two days show broad accretion-like H_alpha (10% width
\~270 km/s), with significant changes in the H_alpha profile, as well as in the
strengths of HeI, Na D and [OI 6300]. TWA 5A is known to be a close triple;

times the observed ellipticity of the lens. We find a best fit value of
$f=0.77^{+0.18}_{-0.21}$, suggesting that the dark matter halos are somewhat
rounder than the light distribution. The fact that we detect a significant
flattening implies that the halos are well aligned with the light distribution.
Given the average ellipticity of the lenses, this implies a halo ellipticity of
$<e_{\rm halo} >=0.33^{+0.07}_{-0.09}$, in fair agreement with results from
numerical simulations of CDM. This result provides strong support for the
existence of dark matter, as an isotropic lensing signal is excluded with 99.5%
confidence. We also study the average mass profile around the lenses, using a
maximum likelihood analysis. We consider two models for the halo mass profile:
a truncated isothermal sphere (TIS) and an NFW profile. We adopt
observationally motivated scaling relations between the lens luminosity and the
velocity dispersion and the extent of the halo. The best fit NFW model yields a
mass $M_{200}=(8.4\pm0.7\pm0.4)\times 10^{11} h^{-1} M_\odot$ and a scale
radius $r_s=16.2^{+3.6}_{-2.9} h^{-1}$ kpc. This value for the scale radius is
in excellent agreement with predictions from numerical simulations for a halo

analyses. Closer to the equatorial plane, the density contour can either bulge
outwards or pinch inwards, depending on the conditions at the launching
surface, particularly the mass flux distribution. We find that even though a
dense, jet-like feature is always formed around the axis, there is no guarantee
that the high-density axial jet would dominate the more tenuous, wide-angle
part of the wind. Specifically, on the 100 AU scale, resolvable by HST and
ground-based adaptive optics for nearby T Tauri winds, the fraction of the wind
mass flux enclosed by the fiducial jet can vary substantially, again depending
on the launching conditions. We show two examples in which the fraction is ~20%
and ~45%. These dependences may provide a way to constrain the conditions at
the launching surface, which are poorly known at present.

overestimated, while the recovered anisotropy is typically more tangential than
the true one. The mass, concentration and velocity anisotropy of haloes are
recovered with better precision when their mean velocity profiles are near

size-of-sample bias. The data show a clear signature of cluster fading below
the detection threshold. The initial cluster mass function (ICMF) was
determined by fitting the mass and age distributions with cluster population
models. These models suggest a new method to determine the ICMF that is nearly
independent of fading or disruption and is based on the slope of a correlation
between age and the maximum cluster mass in equally spaced intervals of
log-age. For a nearly uniform star formation rate, this correlation has a slope
equal to 1/(alpha-1) for an ICMF of dn(M)/dM proportional to M^-alpha. We
determine that alpha is between 2 and 2.4 for the LMC and SMC using this method
plus another method in which models are fit to the mass distribution integrated
over age and to the age distribution integrated over mass. The maximum mass
method also suggests that the cluster formation rate in the LMC age gap between
3 and 13 Gy is about a factor of ten below that in the period from 0.1 Gy to 1
Gy. The oldest clusters correspond in age and mass to halo globular clusters in
the Milky Way. They do not fit the trends for lower-mass clusters but appear to
be a separate population that either had a very high star formation rate and

finite density QCD can be a new attractive subject, we describe fundamental

QCD simulations in small chemical potential regions, where several prominent
works have been reported recently. Next, two-color QCD calculations are

results. Canonical ensemble approach instead of usual grand canonical ensample

effective mu parameter is generated by the vacuum expectation value of a
Standard Model singlet S which has superpotential coupling of the form SH_uH_d
to the electroweak Higgs doublets. The effective mu parameter is thus
dynamically determined as a function of the soft supersymmetry breaking
parameters, and can be complex if the soft parameters have nontrivial
CP-violating phases. We examine the phenomenological constraints on the
reparameterization invariant phase combinations within this framework, and find
that the supersymmetric CP problem can be greatly alleviated in models in which
the phase of the SU(2) gaugino mass parameter is aligned with the soft
trilinear scalar mass parameter associated with the SH_uH_d coupling. We also
study how the phases filter into the Higgs sector, and find that while the
Higgs sector conserves CP at the renormalizable level to all orders of
perturbation theory, CP violation can enter at the nonrenormalizable level at
one-loop order. In the majority of the parameter space, the lightest Higgs

furthermore that the ratio of neutron to proton magnetic form factors
${\mu_p}G_M^n/{\mu_n}G_M^p$ falls with increasing Q^2. We find that the
experimental data are consistent with our expectations of an almost linear
decrease of the ratio ${\mu_p}G_M^n/{\mu_n}G_M^p$ with increasing Q^2,
supporting the statement that the spatial distributions of magnetization are
different for protons and for neutrons.

The purpose of this comment is to show that (i) the main idea contradicts to

schemes, we calculate the success probability and the average fidelity. We show
that the average fidelity of the second scheme cannot exceed that of the first
one.

  A: Mathematical and General","J. Phys. A 37 (2004) 5873","10.1088/0305-4470/37/22/012",,"quant-ph",,"  A new approach to play games quantum mechanically is proposed. We consider
two players who perform measurements in an EPR-type setting. The payoff
relations are defined as functions of *correlations*, i.e. without reference to
classical or quantum mechanics. Classical bi-matrix games are reproduced if the
input states are classical and perfectly anti-correlated, that is, for a
classical correlation game. However, for a quantum correlation game, with an
entangled singlet state as input, qualitatively different solutions are
obtained. For example, the Prisoners' Dilemma acquires a Nash equilibrium if
the players both apply a mixed strategy. It appears to be conceptually
impossible to reproduce the properties of quantum correlation games within the
framework of classical games.

bipartite Gaussian states by considering decompositions into pure Gaussian
states only. We show that this quantity is an entanglement monotone under
Gaussian operations and provide a simplified computation for states of
arbitrary many modes. For the case of one mode per site the remaining
variational problem can be solved analytically. If the considered state is in
addition symmetric with respect to interchanging the two modes, we prove
additivity of the considered entanglement measure. Moreover, in this case and
considering only a single copy, our entanglement measure coincides with the
true entanglement of formation.

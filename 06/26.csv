it remains unresolved whether a dependence on redshift exists and whether the

microturbulence, density, and properties of the radiation field. We find that
the Fe II UV/ Mg II ratio combined with Fe II (UV)/ Fe II (Optical) emission

measurement using astrometric observations within a few years, and thus could
be important for testing pre-main sequence evolutionary models. Our

bound to TWA 5A. We find that the flux ratio of UY Aur has changed
dramatically, by more than a magnitude in the H-band, possibly as a result of
variable extinction. With a smaller flux ratio, the system may once again
become detectable as an optical binary, as it was at the time of its discovery
in 1944. Taken together, our results demonstrate that adaptive optics on large

disk accretion flows around black holes by solving the multi-frequency zeroth
moment equation of the radiation transfer equation under the flux-limited
diffusion approximation as well as the energy equation of gas. Special
attention is paid to the photon-trapping effects, the effects that photons are
trapped within accretion flow and are swallowed by a black hole, with little
being radiated away. It is found that when flow luminosity is below about twice
the Eddington luminosity (L<2L_E) photon trapping is ineffective and the SED
shifts to the higher-energy side as L increases. The peak frequency at which
the SED reaches its peak becomes at maximum three times higher than that given
by the standard-disk model, which might resolve the so-called 'too hot
accretion disk problem.' When L>2L_E, in contrast the peak frequency of the SED
tends to decrease with increase of mass-accretion rate. This is due to enhanced
photon-trapping. Since high-energy photons are generated near the equatorial
plane, they can be more effectively trapped in flow than low-energy ones and,
hence, the high energy part of radiation is suppressed. Finally, the observed
time variation of IC 342 S1, which is an ultraluminous X-ray source, in the
X-ray HR diagram can be explained by the modulation of the mass accretion rate.
In comparison with the observational data, we estimate the mass of black hole
in IC 342 S1 is around 100 solar mass.

simulations to investigate the formation of clumping in freely-expanding

induces a forward shock that compresses the outer ambient gas into a shell. The
radiative energy deposited by the radioactivity leaks out across the shock by
radiative diffusion, and we investigate its effect on the evolution of the
ejecta structure. Compared to the hydrodynamical adiabatic approximation with
gamma =4/3, the preshock gas becomes accelerated by the radiation outflow. The
shock is thus weakened and the shell becomes broader and less dense. The
thickness of the shell takes up <~ 4 % of the radius of the bubble, and the
structure of the shell can be approximately described by a self-similar
solution. We compared the properties of the shell components with those of the
ejecta clumps indicated by our previous hydrodynamical simulations for the
later interaction of clumps with the outer supernova remnant. The high density
contrast across the shell, chi ~ 100, is compatible with that of ejecta clumps

calculate time evolution of a luminous, optically thick accretion disk around a

and low- luminosity states. We, especially, carefully solve the behavior of the
innermost part of the disk, since it produces significant number of photons
during the burst, and fit the theoretical spectra with the multi-color disk
model. The fitting parameters are $\Tin$ (the maximum disk temperature) and
$\Rin$ (the innermost radius of the disk). We find an abrupt, transient
increase in $\Tin$ and a temporary decrease in $\Rin$ during a burst, which are
actually observed in GRS 1915+105. The precise behavior is subject to the
viscosity prescription. We prescribe the radial-azimuthal component of
viscosity stress tensor to be $T_{r \phi}=-\alpha \Pi (p_{\rm gas}/p)^{\mu}$,
with $\Pi$ being the height integrated pressure, $\alpha$ and $\mu$ being the
parameter, and $p$ and $p_{\rm gas}$ being the total pressure and gas pressure
on the equatorial plane, respectively. Model with $\mu=0.1$ can produce the
overall time changes of $\Tin$ and $\Rin$, but cannot give an excellent fit to
the observed amplitudes. Model with $\mu=0.2$, on the other hand, gives the
right amplitudes, but the changes of $\Tin$ and $\Rin$ are smaller. Although
precise matching is left as future work, we may conclude that the basic
properties of the bursts of GRS 1915+105 can be explained by our ``limit-cycle
oscillation'' model. It is then required that the spectral hardening factor at
high luminosities should be about 3 at around the Eddington luminosity instead
of less than 2 as is usually assumed.

variations that indicate the presence of 2 rotationally modulated hot spots
corresponding to the two magnetosphere poles. It correlates well with the HeI
line flux, with B-V and the V excess flux. We have indications of a time delay
between the main emission lines and veiling, the lines formed farther away
preceding the veiling changes. The time delay we measure is consistent with
accreted material propagating downwards the accretion columns at free fall
velocity from a distance of about 8 Rstar. We also report periodic radial
velocity variations of the photospheric spectrum which might point to the
existence of a 0.02 Msun object orbiting the star at a distance of 0.08 AU.
During a few days, the variability of the system was strongly reduced and the
line fluxes and veiling severely depressed. We argue that this episode of
quiescence corresponds to the temporary disruption of the magnetic
configuration at the disk inner edge. The radial velocity variations of inflow
and outflow diagnostics in the Halpha profile yield further evidence for large
scale variations of the magnetic configuration on a timescale of a month. These
results may provide the first clear evidence for large scale instabilities
developping in T Tauri magnetospheres as the magnetic field lines are twisted

dumping material onto the central star via magnetospheric accretion. The inner
edge of the disk is deformed by its interaction with the tilted magnetosphere,
producing eclipses as it rotates and occults the photosphere periodically. From
the shape of the polarisation curve in the QU-Plane we confirm that the

then recovered slightly. Their photospheric spectra resemble a rotating G0 Ib
supergiant, with v_eq sin i = 70 km/s for FU Ori and 55 km/s for V1057 Cyg. As
V1057 Cyg faded, P Cyg structure in Halpha and the IR CaII lines strengthened
and a complex shortward-displaced shell spectrum increased in strength,
disappeared in 1999, and reappeared in 2001. Night-to-night changes in the wind
structure of FU Ori show evidence of sporadic infall. The strength of P Cyg
absorption varied cyclically with a period of 14.8 days, with phase stability
maintained over 3 seasons, and is believed to be the rotation period. The
structure of the photospheric lines also varies cyclically, but with a period
of 3.54 days. A similar variation may be present in V1057 Cyg. As V1057 Cyg has
faded, the emission lines of a pre-existing low-excitation chromosphere have

central emission cores in the absorption lines, not by orbital motion in an
inclined Keplerian disk. No dependence of v_eq sin i on wavelength or
excitation potential was detected in either star, again contrary to expectation
for a self-luminous accretion disk. Nor are critical lines in the near infrared
accounted for by synthetic disk spectra. A rapidly rotating star near the edge

eruptions may not be a property of ordinary TTS, but may be confined to a
special subspecies of rapid rotators having powerful quasi-permanent winds.

i.e. composite star formation histories, are considered. This is, in fact, one
of the major problems when facing the study of stellar populations in star
clusters and galaxies. Typically, the observational efforts have been aimed to
find the most appropriate spectroscopic indicators in order to avoid, as far as
possible, degeneracies in the parameter space. However, from a practical point
of view, the most suited observables are not, necessarily, those that provide
more orthogonality in that parameter space, but those that give the best
balance between parameter degeneracy and sensitivity to signal-to-noise ratio

of typical line-strength indices and colors on SN_A allows to define a
suitability parameter which helps to obtain better realistic combinations of

converted to carbon monoxide. Hydrogen, oxygen and deuterium atoms, as well as
CO molecules, are allowed to accrete on to dust particles and react there to
produce various stable molecules. The surface abundances, as well as the

We compare the vertex corrected theory with the non-crossing approximation of
the Holstein model within a local approximation. We identify two regions of the
electron density where $m^*$ and $T_c$ are enhanced or decreased by the
inclusion of the vertex diagrams. We show that the crossover between the
enhancement at low density and the decrease towards half filling is almost
independent of the microscopic electron-phonon parameters. These different
behaviors are explained in terms of the net sign of the vertex diagrams which
is positive at low densities and negative close to half filling. Predictions of
the present theory for doped MgB$_2$, which is argued to be in the low density

Aspects of the developed pattern depend on the initial distribution function of

the Brillouin zone. The long-time behavior of the spatial structures emerging
due to modulational instability is characterized by the periodic recurrence to
the initial low-density state in a finite optical lattice. We propose a simple

degenerate. The dot in its ground state cannot then be regarded as a simple
quantum top in the sense that beside its spin operator other dot (vector)
operators ${\bf R}_{n}$ are needed (in order to fully determine its quantum
states), which have non-zero matrix elements between states of different spin
multiplets $<S_{i}M_{i} |{\bf R}_{n}|S_{j}M_{j} > \ne 0$. These ""Runge-Lenz""
operators do not appear in the isolated dot-Hamiltonian (so in some sense they
are ""hidden""). Yet, they are exposed when tunneling between dot and leads is
switched on. The effective spin Hamiltonian which couples the metallic electron
spin ${\bf s}$ with the operators of the dot then contains new exchange terms,
$J_{n} {\bf s} \cdot {\bf R}_{n}$ beside the ubiquitous ones $J_{i} {\bf

dynamical group (usually SO(n)). Remarkably, the value of $n$ can be controlled
by gate voltages, indicating that abstract concepts such as dynamical symmetry
groups are experimentally realizable. Moreover, when an external magnetic field
is applied then, under favorable circumstances, the exchange interaction
involves solely the Runge-Lenz operators ${\bf R}_{n}$ and the corresponding
dynamical symmetry group is SU(n). For example, the celebrated group SU(3) is
realized in triple quantum dot with four electrons.

to the well-known discontinuous Einstein equation solutions like shock-wave

  For the centrally symmetric stationary solution discussed in the paper, the

symmetry protects the Higgs mass and guarantees the absence of quadratic
divergences at any loop order. The gauge and Yukawa interactions for the PGB
Higgs are introduced in a simply way in the 5D AdS theory, and their one-loop
contributions to the Higgs potential are calculated using perturbation theory.
These contributions are finite, giving a squared-mass to the Higgs which is
one-loop smaller than the mass of the first Kaluza-Klein state. We also show
that if the symmetry breaking is caused by boundary conditions in the extra
dimension, the PGB Higgs corresponds to the fifth component of the bulk gauge
boson. To make the model fully realistic, a tree-level Higgs quartic coupling
must be induced. We present a possible mechanism to generate it and discuss the
conditions under which an unwanted large Higgs mass term is avoided.

theory where the spatial slice, an infinite strip, is a manifold with
boundaries. As standard star products are not correct for such manifolds, the
standard non-commutative CS theory is not also appropriate here. Instead we
formulate a new finite-dimensional matrix CS model as an approximation to the
CS theory on the strip. A work which has points of contact with ours is due to
Lizzi, Vitale and Zampini where the authors obtain a description for the fuzzy
disc. The gauge fields in our approach are operators supported on a subspace of
finite dimension N+\eta of the Hilbert space of eigenstates of a simple
harmonic oscillator with N, \eta \in Z^+ and N \neq 0. This oscillator is
associated with the underlying Moyal plane. The resultant matrix CS theory has
a fuzzy edge. It becomes the required sharp edge when N and \eta goes to
infinity in a suitable sense. The non-commutative CS theory on the strip is
defined by this limiting procedure. After performing the canonical constraint
analysis of the matrix theory, we find that there are edge observables in the
theory generating a Lie algebra with properties similar to that of a
non-abelian Kac-Moody algebra. Our study shows that there are (\eta+1)^2
abelian charges (observables) given by the matrix elements (\cal A_i)_{N-1 N-1}
and (\cal A_i)_{nm} (where n or m \geq N) of the gauge fields, that obey
certain standard canonical commutation relations. In addition, the theory
contains three unique non-abelian charges, localized near the N^th level. We
show that all non-abelian edge observables except these three can be
constructed from the abelian charges above. Using the results of this analysis
we discuss the large N and \eta limit.

and generalised random processes a new range of examples for continuous tensor
product systems of Hilbert spaces introduced by Arveson for classifying
$E_0$-semigroups. This paper establishes the converse: Each continuous tensor
product systems of Hilbert spaces comes with measure types of distributions of
random (closed) sets in [0,1] or $R_+$. These measure types are stationary and
factorise over disjoint intervals. In a special case of this construction, the
corresponding measure type is an invariant of the product system and the range
of the invariant is characterized.
  Moreover, based on a detailed study of this kind of measure types, we
construct for each stationary factorizing measure type a continuous tensor
product systems of Hilbert spaces such that this measure type arises as the
before mentioned invariant.
  The measure types of the above described kind are connected with
representations of the corresponding $L^\infty$-spaces. This leads to direct
integral representations of the elements of a given product system which
combine well under tensor products. Using this structure in a constructive way,
we can relate to any (type III) product system a product system of type $II_0$
preserving isomorphy classes. Thus, the classification of type III product
systems reduces to that of type II ones.
  Further, we show that all consistent measurable structures on an algebraic
continuous tensor product systems of Hilbert spaces yield isomorphic product
systems. Thus the measurable structure of a continuous tensor product systems
of Hilbert spaces is essentially determined by its algebraic one.

$G$, $g^{-}(G)$ and $g^{+}(G)$ are the minimum and maximum geodetic numbers

  quasispecies","10 pages pdf, as published by BMC","BMC Microbiology 3:11 (2003)",,,"physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft nlin.AO q-bio.PE",,"  Background. In a number of recent experiments with food-and-mouth disease
virus, a deleterious mutant, was found to avoid extinction and remain in the
population for long periods of time. This observation was called quasispecies
memory. The origin of quasispecies memory is not fully understood.
  Results. We propose and analyze a simple model of complementation between the
wild type virus and a mutant that has an impaired ability of cell entry. The
mutant will go extinct unless it is recreated from the wild type through
mutations. However, under phenotypic mixing-and-hiding as a mechanism of
complementation, the time to extinction in the absence of mutations increases
with increasing multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). The mutant's frequency at
equilibrium under selection-mutation balance also increases with increasing
m.o.i. At high m.o.i., a large fraction of mutant genomes are encapsidated with
wild-type protein, which enables them to infect cells as efficiently as the
wild type virions, and thus increases their fitness to the wild-type level.
Moreover, even at low m.o.i. the equilibrium frequency of the mutant is higher
than predicted by the standard quasispecies model, because a fraction of mutant
virions generated from wild-type parents will also be encapsidated by wild-type
protein.
  Conclusions. Our model predicts that phenotypic hiding will strongly
influence the population dynamics of viruses, particularly at high m.o.i., and
will also have important effects on the mutation--selection balance at low
m.o.i. The delay in mutant extinction and increase in mutant frequencies at
equilibrium may, at least in part, explain memory in quasispecies populations.

thermal reservoirs. For relatively short molecules at normal temperatures heat
conduction is dominated by the harmonic part of the molecular force-field. We
develop a general theory for the heat conduction through harmonic chains in
3-dimensions. A Landauer-type expression for the heat conduction is obtained,
in agreement with other recent studies. We use this formalism to study the heat
conduction properties of alkanes. For relatively short (1-30 carbon atoms)
chains the length and temperature dependence of the molecular heat conduction
result from the balance of three factors: (i) The molecular frequency spectrum
in relation to the frequency cutoff of the thermal reservoirs, (ii) the degree
of localization of the molecular normal modes and (iii) the molecule-heat
reservoirs coupling. The fact that molecular modes at different frequency
regimes have different localization properties gives rise to intricate
dependence of the heat conduction on molecular length at different
temperatures. For example, the heat conduction increases with molecular length
for short molecular chains at low temperatures. Similar considerations apply
for isotopically substituted disordered chains. Finally, we compare the heat
conduction obtained from this microscopic calculation to that estimated by
considering the molecule as a cylinder characterized by a macroscopic heat
conduction typical to organic solids. We find that this classical model
overestimates the heat conduction of single alkane molecules by about an order
of magnitude at room temperature. Implications of the present study to the
problem of heating in electrically conducting molecular junctions are pointed
out.

functions defined on positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs), as opposed to
the restricted class of orthogonal projection-valued measures used in the
original theorem. The advantage of this method is that it works for
two-dimensional quantum systems (qubits) and even for vector spaces over
rational fields--settings where the standard theorem fails. Furthermore, unlike
the method necessary for proving the original result, the present one is rather
elementary. In the case of a qubit, we investigate similar results for frame
functions defined upon various restricted classes of POVMs. For the so-called
trine measurements, the standard quantum probability rule is again recovered.

computing. We present here a few simple examples in which quantum computing
without entanglement is better than anything classically achievable, in terms
of the reliability of the outcome after a xed number of oracle calls. Using a
separable (that is, unentangled) n-qubit state, we show that the Deutsch-Jozsa
problem and the Simon problem can be solved more reliably by a quantum computer
than by the best possible classical algorithm, even probabilistic. We conclude
that: (a) entanglement is not essential for quantum computing; and (b) some
advantage of quantum algorithms over classical algorithms persists even when
the quantum state contains an arbitrarily small amount of information|that is,
even when the state is arbitrarily close to being totally mixed.

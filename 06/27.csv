(z=0.162). This is the first time that this quasar is observed in the hard
X-ray range (above 2 keV). We find that Q0056-363 is a powerful X-ray quasar,
with a 0.3-12 keV unabsorbed luminosity of about 1.2 x 10^45 erg s-1 with the
largest part (~67%) emitted below 2 keV. The spectrum reveals a large
featureless soft X-ray excess below 2 keV and a strong broad FeKalpha line at
6.4 keV (in the quasar frame). The FeK alpha line is due to low to moderate
ionization states of iron (i.e., < Fe XVII), with an equivalent width of about
250 eV and a velocity width of about 25,000 km s-1. Q0056-363 is presently the
most luminous AGN known to exhibit such a broad and intense FeKalpha line
profile from near neutral iron. The line can be fitted with a relativistic
profile from an accretion disc around either a Schwarzschild (non-rotating) or
a Kerr (rotating) black hole. A combination of two thermal Comptonization
components and a disc reflection model is favored to explain both the continuum
over the energy range 0.3-12 keV and the FeK alpha line. A patchy corona
covering a large part of the inner disc surface is needed in order to be
compatible with the accretion rate inferred from the spectral energy
distribution of Q0056-363, unless the mass of the black hole is much higher
than about 5 x 10^8 M_odot.

100, and 170mue. The spatial resolution of these FIR maps allows the separation
of spiral arms and interarm regions and the isolation of a large number of
star-forming regions. The spectral energy distribution in the FIR indicates a
superposition of two components, a warm one originating from dust at ~45K, and
a cold one, at ~16K. The warm component is concentrated towards the spiral arms
and the star-forming regions, and is likely heated by the UV radiation from OB
stars. The cold component is more smoothly distributed over the disk, and
heated by the diffuse interstellar radiation. For the about 60 star-forming
regions detected the H-alpha/FIR flux ratio increases significantly with the
distance from the galaxy center, probably due to decreasing extinction. An
anti-correlation of F_Ha/F_60 with F_170 suggests the intrinsic extinction to
be related to the cold dust surface brightness according to
A_V/S_170~0.03mag/MJy*sr. For the total galaxy the star formation rate (SFR)
derived from the FIR is in agreement with that derived from the de-extincted
H-alpha emission. For individual star-forming regions, a consistency between
SFRs derived from the optical and from the FIR requires only a fraction of the
UV radiation to be absorbed locally. The individual star-forming regions also
show a local radio-FIR correlation. This local correlation is, however, due to
quite different components than to those that lead to the well-known global
radio-FIR correlation for entire galaxies.

a central wind via the coupling of a stellar dipole field to the inner edge of
an accretion disc. Our method employs a series of nested computational grids,
which allows the simulations to follow the central wind out to scales of tens
of AU, where it may interact with its surroundings. The coupling between the
stellar magnetosphere and disc inner edge has been known to produce an outflow
containing both a highly collimated jet plus a wide-angle flow. The jet and
wide-angle wind flow at roughly the same speed (100--200 km/s), and most of the
energy and mass is carried off at relatively wide angles. We show that the
addition of a weak disc-associated field (<< 0.1 Gauss) has little effect on
the wind launching, but it collimates the entire flow (jet + wide wind) at a
distance of several AU. The collimation is inevitable, regardless of the
relative polarity of the disc field and stellar dipole, and the result is a
more powerful and physically broader collimated flow than from the star-disc
interaction alone. Within the collimation region, the morphology of the
large-scale flow resembles a pitchfork, in projection. We compare these results
with observations of outflows from YSO's and discuss the possible origin of the

circumstellar disks. Thus, it presents a rare opportunity to study X-ray
activity in a large sample of optically invisible protostars and classical T
Tauri stars (cTTS) undergoing accretion. Chandra detected 283 X-ray sources of
which 248 were identified with counterparts at other wavelengths, mostly in the
near-IR. Astrometric registration of Chandra images against 2MASS resulted in
sub-arcsecond positional accuracy and high-confidence identifications of IR
counterparts. The Chandra detections are characterized by hard heavily-
absorbed spectra and spectacular variability. Spectral analysis of >100 sources
gives a mean extinction A_v = 10.5 mag and typical plasma energies E = 3 keV.
The range of variability includes rapid impulsive flares and persistent
low-level fluctuations indicative of strong magnetic activity, as well as slow
rises and falls in count rate whose origin is more obscure. Some outbursts

formation, paying particular attention to artificial numerical effects. We find
that a cold gas disc forming in an ambient hot gas halo receives a strong
hydrodynamic torque from the hot gas. By splitting the hydrodynamic force into
artificial viscosity and pressure gradients, we find that the angular momentum
transport is caused not by the artificial viscosity but by the pressure
gradients. Using simple test simulations of shear flows, we conclude that the
pressure gradient-based viscosity can be divided into two components: one due
to the noisiness of SPH and the other to ram pressure. The former is
problematic even with very high resolution because increasing resolution does
not reduce the noisiness. On the other hand, the ram pressure effect appears
only when a cold gas disc or sheet does not contain enough particles. In such a
case, holes form in the disc or sheet, and then ram pressure from intra-hole
hot gas, causes significant deceleration. In simulations of galactic disc
formation, star formation usually decreases the number of cold gas particles,
and hole formation leads to the fragmentation of the disc. To circumvent these
problem, we modify the SPH algorithm, decoupling the cold from the hot gas
phases, i.e. inhibiting the hydrodynamic interaction between cold and hot
particles. This, a crude modelling of a multi-phase fluid in SPH cosmological
simulations, leads to the formation of smooth extended cold gas discs and to
better numerical convergence. The decoupling is applicable in so far as the
self-gravitating gas disc with negligible external pressure is a good
approximation for a cold gas disc. (abridged)

of unprecedented contrast. Apodized pupils provide an attractive way to achieve
such contrast but they are difficult, perhaps impossible, to manufacture to the
required tolerance and they absorb about 90% of the light in order to create
the apodization, which of course lengthens the exposure times needed for planet
detection. A recently proposed alternative is to use two mirrors to accomplish
the apodization. With such a system, no light is lost. In this paper, we
provide a careful mathematical analysis, using one dimensional mirrors, of the
on-axis and off-axis performance of such a two-mirror apodization system. There
appear to be advantages and disadvantages to this approach. In addition to not
losing any light, we show that the nonuniformity of the apodization implies an
extra magnification of off-axis sources and thereby makes it possible to build
a real system with about half the aperture that one would otherwise require or,
equivalently, resolve planets at about half the angular separation as one can
achieve with standard apodization. More specifically, ignoring pointing error
and stellar disk size, a planet at $1.7 \lambda/D$ ought to be at the edge of
detectability. However, we show that the non-zero size of a stellar disk pushes
the threshold for high-contrast so that a planet must be at least $2.5
\lambda/D$ from its star to be detectable. The off-axis analysis of
two-dimensional mirrors is left for future study.

Initial analyses of this absorber found it gave a high D/H value, 1.8 - 3.1
\times 10^{-4} (Webb et al. 1998), inconsistent with several higher redshift
measurements. It is thus important to critically examine this measurement. By
analysing the velocity widths of the DI, HI and metal lines present in this
system, Kirkman et al. (2001) report that the additional absorption in the blue
wing of the lya line can not be DI, with a confidence level of 98%. Here we
present a more detailed analysis, taking into account possible wavelength
shifts between the three sets of HST spectra used in the analysis. We find that
the constraints on this system are not as strong as those claimed by Kirkman et

parameters expected for DI is marginally worse than 1 sigma.

estimate for the main system. Here we show that this absorber actually has
log[N(HI)] < 14.6 and does not impact on the estimate of N(HI) in the system of
interest at z = 0.701.

analysis which were not explored in previous studies, and hence help refine the

from oxygen-rich to carbon-rich objects, and finally to estimate the efficiency
of mass-loss by stellar winds. In addition to this, accurate physical models of
the dusty shells are presented in which the re-processing of radiation from the

is examined to show how important features evolve with time. The SEDs are then
convolved with the IRAS filters to obtain the flux in various pass-bands for
individual AGB stars of different, mass, chemical composition, and age. The

this ratio for composite quasar spectra which cover a redshift range of 0 < z <

essentially the same FeII/MgII emission ratios and very similar continuum and

magnesium abundance of the gas in bright quasars since z=5. Current
nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution models predict that alpha-elements like
magnesium are produced in massive stars ending in type II SNe, while iron is
formed predominantly in SNe of type Ia with intermediate mass progenitors. This
results in an iron enrichment delay of 0.2 to 0.6 Gyr. We conclude that intense

effective spin interactions in the Mott and superfluid phases on the same
footing. Using the new approach we chart the phase boundaries of the broken
spin symmetry states up to the Mott to superfluid transition and beyond. Near
the transition point, the magnitude of spin exchange can be very large, which
facilitates the experimental realization of spin-ordered states. We find that
spin and quantum fluctuations have a dramatic effect on the transition making
it first order in extended regions of the phase diagram. For Mott states with
even occupation we find that the competition between effective Heisenberg
exchange and spin-dependent on--site interaction leads to an additional phase
transition from a Mott insulator with no broken symmetries into a spin-ordered
insulator.

satisfiability problems. He defined an infinite number of propositional
satisfiability problems (nowadays usually called Boolean constraint
satisfaction problems) and showed that all these satisfiability problems are
either in P or NP-complete. In recent years, similar results have been obtained
for quite a few other problems for Boolean constraints.Almost all of these
problems are variations of the satisfiability problem.
  In this paper, we address a problem that is not a variation of
satisfiability, namely, the isomorphism problem for Boolean constraints.
Previous work by B\""ohler et al. showed that the isomorphism problem is either
coNP-hard or reducible to the graph isomorphism problem (a problem that is in
NP, but not known to be NP-hard), thus distinguishing a hard case and an easier
case. However, they did not classify which cases are truly easy, i.e., in P.
This paper accomplishes exactly that. It shows that Boolean constraint

a catalog of component parts, using known relations between types, and picking
values for object attributes. This highly combinatorial problem in the field of
constraint programming has been addressed with a variety of approaches since
the foundation system R1(McDermott82). An inherent difficulty in solving
configuration problems is the existence of many isomorphisms among
interpretations. We describe a formalism independent approach to improve the
detection of isomorphisms by configurators, which does not require to adapt the
problem model. To achieve this, we exploit the properties of a characteristic
subset of configuration problems, called the structural sub-problem, which
canonical solutions can be produced or tested at a limited cost. In this paper
we present an algorithm for testing the canonicity of configurations, that can
be added as a symmetry breaking constraint to any configurator. The cost and
efficiency of this canonicity test are given.

realisations about the theory of computation in distributive categories.
Distributive categories have been proposed as a foundational tool for Computer
Science in the last years, starting from the papers of R.F.C. Walters. We shall
focus on two major topics: distributive computability, i.e., a generalized
theory of computability based on distributive categories, and the Imp(G)
language, which is a language based on the syntax of distributive categories.
The link between the former and the latter is that the functions computed by
Imp(G) programs are exactly the distributively computable functions.

approaching the de Sitter state at late times, consistent with the cosmic
no-hair conjecture. On the other hand, solutions that approach the flat FL
state at early times are special and admit a so-called isotropic initial
singularity. For both classes of models the asymptotic expansion of the line
element contains an arbitrary spatial metric at leading order, indicating
asymptotic spatial inhomogeneity. We show, however, that in the asymptotic
regimes this spatial inhomogeneity is significant only at super-horizon scales.

method, the Teukolsky equation is transformed into a Regge-Wheeler type
equation that reduces to the standard Klein-Gordon equation in the flat space
limit, while in the other method, which were introduced by Mano, Suzuki and
Takasugi relatively recently, the Teukolsky equation is directly used in its
original form. The former has an advantage that it is intuitively easy to
understand how various curved space effects come into play. However, it becomes
increasingly complicated when one goes on to higher and higher post-Newtonian
orders. In contrast, the latter has an advantage that a systematic calculation
to higher post-Newtonian orders is relatively easily implementable, but
otherwise so mathematical that it is hard to understand the interplay of higher
order terms. In this paper, we review both methods so that their pros and cons

large, they fill the plane and a hydrodynamic treatment becomes possible,
resulting in the non-commutative theory of Susskind. Key to the story is the
recent D-brane realisation of vortices and their moduli spaces.

$OSp(1|32)\times OSp(1|32)$ is investigated, based on the approach by Horava in
hep-th/9712130. In the high energy limit (expansion in M), where only the
highest ($R^5$) terms survive in the action, the supergroup contracts to the
D'Auria-Fre M theory supergroup. Then the contracted equations of motion are
solved by the usual 11d supergravity equations of motion, linearized in
everything but the vielbein. These two facts suggest that the whole nonlinear
11d sugra should be obtainable somehow in the contraction limit. Type IIB also
arises as a contraction of the $OSp(1|32)\times OSp(1|32)$ theory. The presence
of a cosmological constant in 11d constraints the parameter M experimentally to
be of the order of the inverse horizon size, $1/L_0$. Then the 11d Planck mass
$M_{P,11}\sim 10GeV$ (hopefully higher: $>TeV$ due to uncertainties).
Unfortunately, the most naive attempt at cosmological implications for the
theory is excluded experimentally. Interestingly, the low energy expansion
(high M) of the CS theory, truncated to the gravitational sector, gives much
better phenomenology.

distinct theories showing opposite or complimentary properties of some
symmetry, taking into account the interference effects. The above mentioned
symmetry is hidden in the composite (or soldered) theory. In the present work
it is shown that a pair of noncommutative Maxwell-Chern-Simons theories, having
opposite signs in their respective topological terms, can be consistently
soldered to yield the Proca model (Maxwell theory with a mass term) with
corrections that are at least quadratic in the noncommutativity parameter. We
further argue that this model can be thought of as the noncommutative
generalization of the Proca theory of ordinary spacetime. It is well-known that
abelian noncommutative gauge theory bears a close structural similarity with
non-abelian gauge theory. This fact is manifested in a non-trivial way if the
present work is compared with existing literature, where soldering of
non-abelian models are discussed. Thus the present work further establishes the
robustness of the soldering programme. The subtle role played by gauge
invariance, (or the lack of it), in the above soldering process, is revealed in
an interesting way.

According to our formulation, the FQHE gets a fractal structure from the
connection between the filling factors and the Hausdoff dimension of the
quantum paths of particles termed fractons which obey a fractal distribution
function associated with a fractal von Neumann entropy. This way, the quantum
Hall transitions satisfy some properties related to the Farey sequences of
rational numbers and so our theoretical description of the FQHE establishes a

interval $(0,T]$. This is a temporally inhomogeneous diffusion process whose
transition probability density depends on a value of $T$, and in the limit $T
\to \infty$ it converges to a temporally homogeneous diffusion process called
Dyson's model of Brownian motions. It is known that the distribution of
particle positions in Dyson's model coincides with that of eigenvalues of a
Hermitian matrix-valued process, whose entries are independent Brownian
motions. In the present paper we construct such a Hermitian matrix-valued
process, whose entries are sums of Brownian motions and Brownian bridges given
independently of each other, that its eigenvalues are identically distributed
with the particle positions of our temporally inhomogeneous system of
noncolliding Brownian motions. As a corollary of this identification we derive
the Harish-Chandra formula for an integral over the unitary group.

$H(t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4;q)$ of double affine Hecke algebras of type $C^\vee C_1$.
This family generalizes Cherednik's double affine Hecke algebras of rank 1. It
was introduced by Sahi and studied by Noumi and Stokman as an algebraic
structure which controls Askey-Wilson polynomials. We show that if $q=1$, then
the spectrum of the center of $H$ is an affine cubic surface $C$, obtained from
a projective one by removing a triangle consisting of smooth points. Moreover,
any such surface is obtained as the spectrum of the center of $H$ for some
values of parameters. This result allows one to give a simple geometric
description of the action of an extension of $PGL_2(\Bbb Z)$ by $\Bbb Z$ on the
center of $H$. When $C$ is smooth, it admits a unique algebraic symplectic
structure, and the spherical subalgebra $eHe$ of the algebra $H$ for
$q=e^\hbar$ provides its deformation quantization. Using that $H^2(C,\Bbb
C)=\Bbb C^5$, we find that the Hochschild cohomology $HH^2(H)$ (for
$q=e^\hbar$) is 5-dimensional for generic parameter values. From this we deduce
that the only deformations of $H$ come from variations of parameters. This
explains from the point of view of noncommutative geometry why one cannot add
more parameters into the theory of Askey-Wilson polynomials. We also prove that
the five-parameter family $H(t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4;q)$ of algebras yields the
universal deformation of $q$-Weyl algebra crossed with ${\Bbb Z}_2$ and the
family of cubic surfaces $C=C_{\underline{t}}$, $\underline{t}\in

angle variables is applied to study nonlinear ray dynamics with two
sound-channel models and three perturbation models: a single-mode perturbation,
a random-like sound-speed fluctuations, and a mixed perturbation. In the
integrable limit without any perturbation, we derive analytical expressions for
ray arrival times and timefronts at a given range, the main measurable
characteristics in field experiments in the ocean. In the presence of a
single-mode perturbation, ray chaos is shown to arise as a result of
overlapping nonlinear ray-medium resonances. Poincar\'e maps, plots of
variations of the action per a ray cycle length, and plots with rays escaping
the channel reveal inhomogeneous structure of the underlying phase space with
remarkable zones of stability where stable coherent ray clusters may be formed.
We demonstrate the possibility of determining the wavelength of the
perturbation mode from the arrival time distribution under conditions of ray
chaos. It is surprising that coherent ray clusters, consisting of fans of rays
which propagate over long ranges with close dynamical characteristics, can
survive under a random-like multiplicative perturbation modelling sound-speed
fluctuations caused by a wide spectrum of internal waves.

This procedure allows us to generate different hierarchies of nonlinear partial

special relativistic mechanics is well approximated by the trajectory predicted
by Newtonian mechanics if the particle speed is low, i.e., much less than the
speed of light. However, in this paper, it is shown with a counterexample
Hamiltonian dynamical system that Newtonian dynamics can eventually disagree
completely with relativistic dynamics even though the particle speed is low.
After the breakdown of the agreement, either the Newtonian description is no
longer correct or the relativistic description is no longer correct or both
descriptions are no longer correct for the low speed motion.

not lie in one plane, i.e., are in general position.
  Both cases of identical and not identical crystals are considered, and exact
solutions are obtained describing valid positions and orientations of both
crystals. Special attention is paid to the case of small lattice mismatch
between the first and the second crystal (e.g. due to temperature difference)
and small angle of `skewness' (that is to say, an angle between skew lines of
entrance and exit beams is much less than unity).
  We derive also some useful formulations describing beam profile change after
two reflections (whose reflection planes are non-parallel). At last, possible
designing approach for such a skew DC-mono is briefly touched upon.

the motion of the G-actin. Our model is composed of an inclined spring (rod), a
myosin head, a myosin filament and G-actins. We discuss the stochastic
resonance between the myosin head and random noise. The results of calculation
show that the model can convert the random motion to one directional motion,
and the myosin head works as a resonator of random noise which absorbs the
energy through the stochastic resonance. The intermolecular potential between
the myosin head and G-actin and the inclined rod play a key role for the
muscle's motion. The energy consumed by the motor is directly supplied from the
surroundings (i.e., the thermal motions of water molecules).

it is not immediately obvious that the well known expression Re =

relative to a fluid of density rho and viscosity eta--is in fact a ratio of

mixed initial state. The probability to measure a marked state as a function of
time is calculated, and found to depend strongly on the specific initial state.
The form of the function, though, remains as it is in the case of initial pure
state. We study the role of the von Neumann entropy of the initial state, and
show that the entropy cannot be a measure for the usefulness of the algorithm.
We give few examples and show that for some extremely mixed initial states
carrying high entropy, the generalized Grover algorithm is considerably faster
than any classical algorithm.

generated by a point source with a sharp onset in an absorbing medium. The
""traversal'' or ""B\""uttiker-Landauer'' time (which grows linearly with the
distance to the source) for the Hermitian, non-absorbing case is substituted by
three different characteristic quantities. One of them describes the arrival of
a maximum of the density calculated with respect to position, but the maximum
with respect to time for a given position becomes independent of the distance
to the source and is given by the particle's ``survival time'' in the medium.
This later effect, unlike the Hartman effect, occurs for injection frequencies
under or above the cut-off, and for arbitrarily large distances. A possible
physical realization is proposed by illuminating a two-level atom with a
detuned laser.

  Electrodynamics","IOP LaTeX and one figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The notion of ``radiating'' and ``non-radiating'' current sources in
classical electrodynamics plays an important role in calculations of direct and
inverse electromagnetic scattering problems. Such a decomposition of the
current is central for the notion of localized non-radiating electromagnetic
modes. A completely quantum electrodynamic view is explored in this work.
Photon emission and absorption current sources are classified as being either
radiating or non-radiating. This quantum classification corresponds,
respectively and exactly, to the notion of ``real'' and ``virtual'' photon
processes. Causal properties of both real and virtual electromagnetic fields
are discussed.

Furthermore the uncertainty of the group velocity under very weak intensity of
the controlling laser and the uncertainty relation between the phase operator
of coupling laser and the group velocity are approximately given. Considering
the decay rates of various levels, we may analyze the probe laser near
resonance in detail and calculate the fluctuation in both absorption and
dispersion. We also discuss how the fully quantized model reduces to a
semiclassical model when the mean photon numbers of the coupling laser is
getting large.

Ramann scattering, the dark states will extrapolate from an exciton state of an

recently been the focus of considerable interest, particularly in connection
with the problem of separability. The $q$-entropies depend on the density
matrix $\rho$ through the quantity $\omega_q = Tr\rho^q$, and admit as a
particular instance the standard von Neumann entropy in the limit case $q\to
1$. A comprehensive numerical survey of the space of pure and mixed states of
bipartite systems is here performed, in order to determine the volumes in state
space occupied by those states exhibiting various special properties related to
the signs of their conditional $q$-entropies and to their connections with
other separability-related features, including the majorization condition.
Different values of the entropic parameter $q$ are considered, as well as
different values of the dimensions $N_1$ and $N_2$ of the Hilbert spaces
associated with the constituting subsystems. Special emphasis is paid to the
analysis of the monotonicity properties, both as a function of $q$ and as a
function of $N_1$ and $N_2$, of the various entropic functionals considered.

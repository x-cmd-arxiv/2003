extracted from the Canada-France deep fields survey (CFDF). Our catalogue
covers an effective area of ~1700 arcmin^2 divided between three large,
contiguous fields separated widely on the sky. To IAB=24.5, the survey contains
1294 Lyman-break candidates, in agreement with previous measurements by other
authors. Based on comparisons with spectroscopic observations and simulations,
we estimate that our sample of Lyman-break galaxies is contaminated by stars
and interlopers at no more than ~30%. We find that \omega(\theta) is well
fitted by a power-law of fixed slope, \gamma=1.8, even at small (\theta<10'')
angular separations. In two of our three fields, we are able to fit
simultaneously for both the slope and amplitude and find a slope \gamma ~ 1.81.
Our data marginally indicates in one field (at a 3 \sigma level) that the
Lyman-break correlation length r_0 depends on sample limiting magnitude:
brighter Lyman-break galaxies are more clustered than fainter ones. For the
entire CFDF sample, assuming a fixed slope \gamma = 1.8 we find r_0 =
(5.9\pm0.5)h^{-1} Mpc. Using these clustering measurements and prediction for
the dark matter density field, we derive a linear bias of b = 3.5 +/- 0.3.
Finally we show that the dependence of the correlation length with the surface
density of Lyman-break galaxies is in good agreement with a simple picture
where more luminous galaxies are hosted by more massive dark matter halos with
a simple one-to-one correspondence.

0.02 higher reddening zero point in E(B-V) previously determined by Schlegel et

also predict many directions with E(B-V)<0.015 mag. Independent evidence of
reddening at the North Galactic pole is reviewed, with the conclusion that
there still exists directions at the NGP that have E(B-V)<<0.01. Two lines of
evidence suggest that IR reddenings are overpredicted in directions with high
gas-to-dust ratios. As high gas-to-dust directions in the ISM also include the

favored at the ~97 % level. Such a large df/dt can be accomodated by an ~1 Msun

to explore the interaction of gravitational radiation and electromagnetic

observed nearby. The dense cores of these clouds are predicted to undergo
gravitational collapse characterized by the runaway growth of a central density
peak that evolves toward a singularity. As long as collapse can occur, rotation
and magnetic fields do not change this qualitative behavior. The result is that
a very small embryonic star or protostar forms and grows by accretion at a rate
that is initially high but declines with time as the surrounding envelope is
depleted. Rotation causes some of the remaining matter to form a disk around
the protostar, but accretion from protostellar disks is not well understood and
may be variable. Most, and possibly all, stars form in binary or multiple
systems in which gravitational interactions can play a role in redistributing
angular momentum and driving episodes of disk accretion. Variable accretion may
account for some peculiarities of young stars such as flareups and jet
production, and protostellar interactions in forming systems of stars will also
have important implications for planet formation. The most massive stars form
in the densest environments by processes that are not yet well understood but
may include violent interactions and mergers. The formation of the most massive
stars may have similarities to the formation and growth of massive black holes
in very dense environments.

in the host galaxies. Intriguingly, the diffuse X-ray properties of the normal
spirals (both in their disks and halos) fall where extrapolation of the trends
from the starburst galaxies with superwinds would predict. We demonstrate that
the luminosity of diffuse X-ray emission in both disk and halo is directly
proportional to the rate of mechanical energy feedback from massive stars.
Nevertheless, with only three non-starburst normal spiral galaxies it is hard
to exclude an accretion-based origin for extra-planar diffuse X-ray emission
around normal star-forming galaxies. Larger galaxies have more extended
X-ray-emitting halos, but galaxy mass appears to play no role in determining
the properties of the disk or extra-planar X-ray emitting plasma. The
combination of these luminosity and size correlations leads to a correlation
between the surface brightness of the diffuse X-ray emission and the mean star
formation rate per unit area in the disk (L_FIR/D_25^2). We argue that the
crucial spatial region around a galaxy that controls whether gas in
starburst-driven superwinds will escape into the IGM is not the outer halo ~100
kpc from the host galaxy, but the inner few halo scale heights, within ~20 kpc
of the galaxy plane. Given the properties of the gaseous halos we observe,
superwind outflows from disk galaxies of mass M ~ 10^10 -- 10^11 Msun should
still eject some fraction of their material into the IGM. (abstract abridged)

kiloparsec-scale jets. Earlier Hubble Space Telescope observations indicated
the presence of a hundred-parsec scale disk of cool dust and gas surrounding a
central, supermassive ($\sim 4.9\times 10^8\msun$) black hole. The recent
detection of free-free radio absorption by a small, geometrically-thin disk,
combined with earlier studies of the disk's large scale properties, provide the
strictest constraints to date on the nature of the accretion process in this
system. We show here that a supersonic disk, illuminated by the active galactic
nucleus (AGN), can not only account for the observed radio shadowing, but can
also produce the optical broad lines emitted from this region. Beyond a
critical radius $r_c$, line cooling dominates over gravitational dissipation
and the gas is effectively cooled down to temperatures below $10^4$ K. Within
$r_c$, however, heating due to the release of gravitational energy overwhelms
line cooling and the plasma is heated very quickly to a temperature close to
its virial value as it falls toward the central engine. The disk is
optically-thin to UV and X-ray radiation within $r_c$, so the ionizing
radiation from the AGN is preferentially absorbed near $r_c$, affecting the
disk structure significantly. To include the ensuing photoionization effect, we
have used the algorithm Cloudy with additional heating introduced by
gravitational dissipation to calculate the temperature profile and line
emission from the disk in a self-consistent manner. The results of our model
calculation are consistent with current multiwavelength observations of the
disk in this source.

group velocity, which is stationary with respect to a small variation of the
wave vector. An effect of radiated power enhancement is explained in terms of
\emph{photon focusing}. Numerical example is given for a square-lattice
two-dimensional photonic crystal. Predictions of asymptotic analysis are
substantiated with finite-difference time-domain calculations, revealing a
reasonable agreement.

evolution' of Einstein's equations in 3+1 form, we discuss issues regarding the
efficient solution of elliptic equations on domains containing holes (i.e.,
excised regions), via the multigrid method. We consider as a test case the
Poisson equation with a nonlinear term added, as a means of illustrating the
principles involved, and move to a ""real world"" 3-dimensional problem which is
the solution of the conformally flat Hamiltonian constraint with Dirichlet and
Robin boundary conditions. Using our vertex-centered multigrid code, we
demonstrate globally second-order-accurate solutions of elliptic equations over
domains containing holes, in two and three spatial dimensions. Keys to the
success of this method are the choice of the restriction operator near the
holes and definition of the location of the inner boundary. In some cases (e.g.
two holes in two dimensions), more and more smoothing may be required as the
mesh spacing decreases to zero; however for the resolutions currently of
interest to many numerical relativists, it is feasible to maintain second order
convergence by concentrating smoothing (spatially) where it is needed most.
This paper, and our publicly available source code, are intended to serve as
semi-pedagogical guides for those who may wish to implement similar schemes.

Source Galerkin, is based on a numerical analysis of the Schwinger-Dyson

dealing with fermions relatively straightforward, particularly since we can
work on the continuum. Its ultimate success in non-trivial dimensions will
depend on the power of a propagator expansion scheme which also greatly
simplifies numerical calculation of traditional perturbation graphs. The second
method extends Monte Carlo approaches by introducing a procedure to deal with
rapidly oscillating integrals.

the use of the so called ``second order relative spectrum'', to find
eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators in gaps of the essential spectrum. Let
$M$ be a self-adjoint operator acting on the Hilbert space $H$. A complex
number $z$ is in the second order spectrum of $M$ relative to a finite
dimensional subspace $\Lambda\subset dom M^2$ if and only if the truncation to
$\Lambda$ of $(M-z)^2$ is not invertible. It is remarkable that these sets seem
to provide a general method to estimating eigenvalues free from the problems of
spectral pollution present in most linear methods. In this notes we investigate
rigorously various aspects of the use of second order spectrum to finding
eigenvalues. Our main result shows that, under certain fairly mild hypothesis
on $M$, the uniform limit of the second order spectra, as $\Lambda$ increases
toward $H$, contains the isolated eigenvalues of $M$ of finite multiplicity. In
applications the essential spectrum can be computed analytically, while
precisely these eigenvalues are the ones that should be approximated
numerically. Hence this method seems to combine non-pollution and approximation
at a very high level of generality.

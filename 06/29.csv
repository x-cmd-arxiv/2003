in the planetary sciences. It is suggested here that two sources contributed to
its formation, fractionated nebular gases and accreted cometary volatiles.
During terrestrial growth, a transient gas envelope was fractionated from
nebular composition. This transient atmosphere was mixed with cometary
material. The fractionation stage resulted in a high Xe/Kr ratio, with xenon
being more isotopically fractionated than krypton. Comets delivered volatiles
having low Xe/Kr ratios and solar isotopic compositions. The resulting
atmosphere had a near-solar Xe/Kr ratio, almost unfractionated krypton
delivered by comets, and fractionated xenon inherited from the fractionation
episode. The dual origin therefore provides an elegant solution to the
long-standing ""missing xenon"" paradox. It is demonstrated that such a model
could explain the isotopic and elemental abundances of Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe in
the terrestrial atmosphere.

force between dressed holons, then the electron Cooper pairs originating from

their condensation reveals the superconducting ground-state. The electron
superconducting transition temperature is determined by the dressed holon pair
transition temperature, and is proportional to the concentration of doped holes
in the underdoped regime. With the common form of the electron Cooper pair, we
also show that there is a coexistence of the electron Cooper pair and

the antiferromagnetic environment. In absence of long-range antiferromagnetic
order, the spin system can reduce frustration, and also its free energy, by
forming a state with an ordered orientation of the dipole moments, which leads
to the appearance of spiral spin correlations. To investigate this model, a
non-linear sigma model is used in which disorder is introduced via a randomly
fluctuating gauge field. A renormalization group study shows that the collinear
fixed point of the model is destroyed through the disorder and that the
disorder coupling leads to an additive renormalization of the order parameter
stiffness. Further, the stability of the spiral state against the formation of
topological defects is investigated with the use of the replica trick. A
critical disorder strength is found beyond which topological defects
proliferate. Comparing our results with experimental data, it is found that for
a hole density x > 0.02, i.e. in the entire spin glass regime, the disorder
strength exceeds the critical threshold. In addition, some experiments are
proposed in order to distinguish if the incommensurabilities observed in
neutron scattering experiments correspond to a diagonal stripe or a spiral
phase.

behavior of the cosmological perturbation on superhorizon scales is well
approximated in terms of that in the long wavelength limit, and the latter can
be constructed from the evolution of corresponding exactly homogeneous
universe. Using these facts, we investigate the evolution of the cosmological
perturbation on superhorizon scales in the universe dominated by oscillating
multiple scalar fields which are generally interacting with each other, and the
ratio of whose masses is incommensurable. Since the scalar fields oscillate
rapidly around the local minimum of the potential, we use the action angle
variables. We found that this problem can be formulated as the canonical
perturbation theory in which the perturbed part appearing as the result of the
expansion of the universe and the interaction of the scalar fields is bounded
by the negative power ot time. We show that by constructing the canonical
transformations properly, the transformed hamiltonian becomes simple enough to
be solved. As the result of the invetigation using the long wavelength limit
and the canonical perturbation theory, under the sufficiently general
conditions, we prove that for the adiabatic growing mode the Bardeen parameter
stays constant and that for all the other modes the Bardeen parameter decays.
  From the viewpoint of the ergodic theory, it is discussed that as for the
Bardeen parameter, the sigularities appear probabilistically. This analysis
serves the understanding of the evolution of the cosmological perturbations on

gradient. As an important application of this solution, we consider the linear
perturbation method developed by Zel'dovich, investigate the accretion of cold
dark matter due to the formation of wakes when a TCSCS moves with speed $v$ and
discuss the role played by torsion. Our results are compared with those
obtained for cosmic strings in the framework of scalar-tensor theories without
taking torsion into account.

differentiable curve of selfadjoint Fredholm operators. This formula enables us
to prove in a simple way a general spectral flow formula.
  Secondly, we prove a splitting formula (Theorem 4.12) for the spectral flow
of a curve of selfadjoint elliptic operators on a closed manifold, which we
decompose into two parts with commom boundary. Then the formula says that the
spectral flow is a sum of two spectral flows on each part of the separated
manifold with naturally introduced elliptic boundary conditions. In the course
of proving this formula, we investigate a property of the Maslov index for
paths of Fredholm pairs of Lagrangian subspaces

commutative ring structure, with respect to convolution. We identify the
spectrum of homology ring with the universal group-algebra centralizer of the
Langlands dual group $\check G$, and we relate the spectrum of $K$-homology
ring to the universal group-group centralizer of $G$ and of $\check G$. If we
add the loop-rotation equivariance, we obtain a noncommutative deformation of
the ($K$)-homology ring, and thus a Poisson structure on its spectrum. We
identify this structure with the standard one on the universal centralizer. The
commutative subring of $G(C[[t]])$-equivariant homology of the point gives rise
to a polarization which is related to Kostant's Toda lattice integrable system.
We also compute the equivariant $K$-ring of the affine Grassmannian Steinberg
variety. The equivariant $K$-homology of $Gr_G$ is equipped with a canonical
base formed by the classes of simple equivariant perverse coherent sheaves.

numerically. During growth, the magnetic field is spatially intermittent: it
does not uniformly fill the volume, but is concentrated in long thin folded
structures. Contrary to a commonly held view, intermittency of the folded field
does not increase indefinitely throughout the growth stage if diffusion is
present. Instead, as we show, the probability-density function (PDF) of the
field strength becomes self-similar. The normalized moments increase with
magnetic Prandtl number in a powerlike fashion. We argue that the
self-similarity is to be expected with a finite flow scale and system size. In
the nonlinear saturated state, intermittency is reduced and the PDF is
exponential. Parallels are noted with self-similar behavior recently observed
for passive-scalar mixing and for map dynamos.

are capable of supporting such a protocol in the presence of nodes that may lie
and thus be biased. Here, $n$ is the number of nodes in the network. We also
demonstrate the difficulty of performing unbiased and fair election of a leader
with linear classical communication complexity in the absence of quantum
entanglement even if all nodes have perfect random bit generators. We show that
the presence of a sufficient number $O(n/\log n)$ of biased agents leads to a
non-zero limiting probability of biased election of the leader, whereas, the
presence of a smaller number $O(\log n)$ of biased agents matters little. We
define two new related complexity classes motivated by the our leader election

  Recently P. Shor showed that conjectured additivity properties for several
quantum information quantities are in fact equivalent. After giving an
algebraic formulation for the Shor's channel extension, its main asymptotic
property is proved. It is then used to show that additivity for two constrained
channels can be reduced to the same problem for unconstrained channels, and
hence, ""global"" additivity for channels with arbitrary constraints is
equivalent to additivity without constraints.

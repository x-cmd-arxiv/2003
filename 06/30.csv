is designed to extend greatly the sample of identified extragalactic hard X-ray
2-10 keV sources at intermediate fluxes ($\sim 10^{-13} - 10^{-15} erg/cm2/s$).
SEXSI, which studies sources selected from more than 2 deg$^2$, provides an
essential complement to the {\em Chandra} Deep Fields, which reach depths of $5
\times 10^{-16} erg/cm2/s$ (\hardrange) but over a total area of $< 0.2$
deg$^2$. In this paper we describe the characteristics of the survey and our
X-ray data analysis methodology. We present the cumulative flux distribution
for the X-ray sample of 1034 hard sources, and discuss the distribution of
spectral hardness ratios. Our lognlogs in this intermediate flux range connects
to those found in the deep fields, and by combining the data sets, we constrain
the hard X-ray population over the flux range where the differential number
counts change slope, and from which the bulk of the 2 -- 10 keV X-ray
background arises. We further investigate the lognlogs distribution separately
for soft and hard sources in our sample, finding that while a clear change in
slope is seen for the softer sample, the hardest sources are well-described by
a single power-law down to the faintest fluxes, consistent with the notion that
they lie at lower average redshift.

candidate (BHC) X-ray binaries (XRBs) should enter `jet-dominated' states, in
which the majority of the liberated accretion power is in the form of a

flow. This result follows from the empirically established non-linear relation
between radio and X-ray power from low/hard state BHC XRBs, which we assume
also to hold for neutron star (NS) XRBs. Conservative estimates of the jet
power indicate that all BHC XRBs in `quiescence' should be in this
jet-dominated regime. In combination with an additional empirical result,
namely that BHC XRBs are more `radio loud' than NS XRBs, we find that in
quiescence NS XRBs should be up to two orders of magnitude more luminous in
X-rays than BHC XRBs, without requiring any significant advection of energy
into a black hole. This ratio is as observed, and such observations should
therefore no longer be considered as direct evidence for the existence of black
hole event horizons. Furthermore, even if BHCs do contain black holes with
event horizons, this work demonstrates that there is no requirement for the
advection of significant amounts of accretion energy across the horizon.

sample of star-forming (SF) galaxies are identified from among the 3079 of

diagnostics. Using 1.4 GHz luminosities as a reference star formation rate
(SFR) estimator insensitive to obscuration effects, the SFRs derived from the
measured SDSS Halpha, [OII] and u-band luminosities, as well as far-infrared
luminosities from IRAS, are compared. It is established that straightforward
corrections for obscuration and aperture effects reliably bring the SDSS
emission line and photometric SFR estimates into agreement with those at 1.4
GHz, although considerable scatter (~60%) remains in the relations. It thus
appears feasible to perform detailed investigations of star formation for large
and varied samples of SF galaxies through the available spectroscopic and
photometric measurements from the SDSS. We provide herein exact prescriptions
for determining the SFR for SDSS galaxies. The expected strong correlation
between [OII] and Halpha line fluxes for SF galaxies is seen, but with a median
line flux ratio F_[OII]/F_Halpha=0.23, about a factor of two smaller than that
found in the sample of Kennicutt (1992). This correlation, used in deriving the
[OII] SFRs, is consistent with the luminosity-dependent relation found by
Jansen et al. (2001). The median obscuration for the SDSS SF systems is found
to be A_Halpha=1.2 mag, while for the radio detected sample the median
obscuration is notably higher, 1.6 mag, and with a broader distribution.

variations in crowded fields. This method is able to achieve a nearly optimal
differential photometry, even in very dense regions. However, image subtraction
is not limited to photometry, and it is shown in this paper that the method can
be generalized to the measurement of the differential proper motions. It is
important to emphasize that image subtraction can re-construct an un-biased
frame to frame astrometric transform. A nearly optimal determination of this
astrometric transform can be performed by expanding the spatial variations of
the kernel using the derivatives of the constant kernel solution. It is
demonstrated that an expansion using first and second derivatives is optimal.
Differential refraction can be corrected easily using an artificial image and
the first derivatives of the kernel. To illustrate the ability of the method to
measure proper motions, a small sub-area near the center of a Galactic Bulge
field covered 265 times by the OGLE II experiment has been selected. The
resulting astrometric accuracy is very close to the photon noise for the faint
objects, while for the brighter ones it approaches closely the limit set by the
residual seeing fluctuations on the smaller scales. The accuracy obtained with
this new method is compared to the accuracy achieved using classical methods.
The improvement obtained varies from a factor of $\simeq$ 2 for the brighter
objects, to more than a factor of 3 for the fainter ones. This improvement is
typical of the improvement that was obtained for the measurement of the
photometric variations.

variability at all wavelengths which were suitably observed during its 2000
April-July outburst. We examine time-resolved X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, and
infrared data spanning the plateau phase of the outburst. We find that both
X-ray and infrared bands show large amplitude variability. The ultraviolet and
optical variability is more subdued, but clearly correlated with that seen in
the X-rays. The ultraviolet, at least, appears to be dominated by the
continuum, although the lines are also variable. Using the X-ray variations as
a reference point, we find that the UV variability at long wavelengths occurs
later than that at short wavelengths. Uncertainty in HST timing prohibits a
determination of the absolute lag with respect to the X-rays, however. The
transfer function is clearly not a delta-function, exhibiting significant
repeatable structure. For the main signal we can rule out an origin in
reprocessing on the companion star - the lack of variation in the lags is not
consistent with this given a relatively high orbital inclination. Weak
reprocessing from the disc and/or companion star may be present, but is not
required, and another component must dominate the variability. This could be
variable synchrotron emission correlated with X-ray variability, consistent
with our earlier interpretation of the IR flux as due to synchrotron emission
rather than thermal disc emission. In fact the broad-band energy distribution
of the variability from IR to X-rays is consistent with expectations of
optically thin synchrotron emission. We also follow the evolution of the
low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation in X-rays, UV, and optical. Its
properties at all wavelengths are similar indicating a common origin.

constant and resistivity are unaffected, indicating that the ferromagnetism
largely resides on and near the sample surface. Electron microprobe experiments

occur when the number of transmitted charges on the two terminals is the same

Explicit form of the linearized collision operator is obtained. Using this form
the decay rate of the normal mode energy as a function of wave vector $k$ is
estimated to be proportional to $k^{5/3}$. This leads to the $t^{-3/5}$ long
time behavior of the current correlation function, and, therefore, to the
divergent coefficient of heat conductivity. These results are in good agreement
with the results of recent computer simulations. Compared to the results
obtained though the mode coupling theory our estimations give the same $k$
dependence of the decay rate but a different temperature dependence. Using our
estimations we argue that adding a harmonic on-site potential to the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam $\beta$ lattice may lead to finite heat conductivity in this
model.

significantly simpler mode of operation. The scheme provides one Sagnac signal
readout inherently insensitive to laser frequency noise and optical bench
motion for a non-rotating LISA array. This Sagnac output is also insensitive to
clock noise, requires no time shifting of data, nor absolute arm length
knowledge. As all measurements are made at one spacecraft, neither clock
synchronization nor exchange of phase information between spacecraft is
required. The phase-locking configuration provides these advantages for only
one Sagnac variable yet retains compatibility with the baseline approach for
obtaining the other TDI variables. The orbital motion of the LISA constellation
is shown to produce a 14 km path length difference between the
counter-propagating beams in the Sagnac interferometer. With this length
difference a laser frequency noise spectral density of 1 Hz/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$
would consume the entire optical path noise budget of the Sagnac variables. A
significant improvement of laser frequency stability (currently at 30
Hz/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$) would be needed for full-sensitivity LISA operation in the
Sagnac mode. Alternatively, an additional level of time-delay processing could
be applied to remove the laser frequency noise. The new time-delayed
combinations of the phase measurements are presented.

developed for computing the final spectra of stable particles (protons,

compute in great detail the complete decay cascade for any given decay mode
into particles of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). In
particular, it takes into account all interactions of the MSSM during the
perturbative cascade (including not only QCD, but also the electroweak and 3rd
generation Yukawa interactions), and includes a detailed treatment of the SUSY
decay cascade (for a given set of parameters) and of the non-perturbative
hadronization process. All these features allow us to ensure energy
conservation over the whole cascade up to a numerical accuracy of a few per

SUSY-QCD frameworks. I detail the input and output files, describe the role of
each part of the program, and include some advice for using it best.

the current information received from other agents. Necessary and/or sufficient
conditions for the convergence of the individual agents' states to a common

Unlike previous, related studies, the approach of the present paper does not
rely on algebraic graph theory and is of a completely nonlinear nature. It is
rather surprising that with these nonlinear tools, extensions may be obtained
even for the linear cases discussed in the literature. The proof technique
consists of a blend of graph-theoretic and system-theoretic tools integrated
within a formal framework of set-valued Lyapunov theory and may be of
independent interest. Further, it is also observed that more communication does
not necessarily lead to better convergence and may eventually even lead to a
loss of convergence, even for the simple models discussed in the present paper.

proven to be very useful to radiologists in the investigation of breast cancer,
especially in the framework of mammographic-screening programs. A breast
neoplasia is often marked by the presence of microcalcification clusters and
massive lesions in the mammogram: hence the need for tools able to recognize
such lesions at an early stage. In the framework of the GPCALMA (GRID Platform
for Computer Assisted Library for MAmmography) project, the co-working of
italian physicists and radiologists built a large distributed database of
digitized mammographic images (about 5500 images corresponding to 1650
patients) and developed a CAD (Computer Aided Detection) system, able to make
an automatic search of massive lesions and microcalcification clusters. The CAD
is implemented in the GPCALMA integrated station, which can be used also for
digitization, as archive and to perform statistical analyses. Some GPCALMA
integrated stations have already been implemented and are currently on clinical
trial in some italian hospitals. The emerging GRID technology can been used to
connect the GPCALMA integrated stations operating in different medical centers.
The GRID approach will support an effective tele- and co-working between
radiologists, cancer specialists and epidemiology experts by allowing remote
image analysis and interactive online diagnosis.

determined by the metric. We construct a unitary map relating a given

changes the metric of the Hilbert space but leaves the Hamiltonian of the

analytically dynamics of entangled states for two- and three-spin systems
coupled by the dipole-dipole interaction. In this case dynamics of the quantum
entanglement is uniquely determined by the time evolution of MQ coherences of
the second order. The real part of the density matrix describing MQ dynamics in

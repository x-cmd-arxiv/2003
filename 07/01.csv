explode as compact Blue Supergiants and produce sub-luminous supernovae that

as RSGs even at low Z. The consequences are obvious for probing the chemical

  Our study is limited in scope with respect to the explosion energies and the
production of radioactive Ni. Within the class of ""extreme SNe II-P""
supernovae, the light curves are rather insensitive with respect to the
progenitor mass and explosion energy compared to analytic models which are
based on parameterized stellar structures. We expect a wider range of

the open star cluster IC348 and the development of a new spectroscopic
classification technique using narrow band photometry. Observations were made
using FLITECAM, the First Light Camera for SOFIA, at the 3-m Shane Telescope at
Lick Observatory. FLITECAM is a new 1-5 micron camera with an 8 arcmin field of
view. Custom narrow band filters were developed to detect absorption features
of water vapor (at 1.495 microns) and methane (at 1.66 microns) characteristic
of brown dwarfs. These filters enable spectral classification of stars and
brown dwarfs without spectroscopy. FLITECAM's narrow and broadband photometry
was verified by examining the color-color and color-magnitude characteristics
of stars whose spectral type and reddening was known from previous surveys.
Using our narrow band filter photometry method, it was possible to identify an
object measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 or better to within +/-3
spectral class subtypes for late-type stars. With this technique, very deep
images of the central region of IC348 (H ~ 20.0) have identified 18 sources as
possible L or T dwarf candidates. Out of these 18, we expect that between 3 - 6
of these objects are statistically likely to be background stars, with the
remainder being true low-mass members of the cluster. If confirmed as cluster
members then these are very low-mass objects (~5 Mjupiter). We also describe
how two additional narrow band filters can improve the contrast between M, L,

random field. It can be defined for a smooth field as the ensemble of pairs of
field lines departing from saddle points, initially aligned with the major axis
of local curvature and connecting them to local maxima. This definition is thus
non local and makes analytical predictions difficult, so we propose a local
approximation: the local skeleton is given by the set of points where the
gradient is aligned with the local curvature major axis and where the second
component of the local curvature is negative.
  We perform a statistical analysis of the length of the total local skeleton,
chosen for simplicity as the set of all points of space where the gradient is
either parallel or orthogonal to the main curvature axis. In all our numerical
experiments, which include Gaussian and various non Gaussian realizations such
as \chi^2 fields and Zel'dovich maps, the differential length is found within a
normalization factor to be very close to the probability distribution function
of the smoothed field. This is in fact explicitly demonstrated in the Gaussian
case.
  This result might be discouraging for using the skeleton as a probe of non
Gausiannity, but our analyses assume that the total length of the skeleton is a
free, adjustable parameter. This total length could in fact be used to
constrain cosmological models, in CMB maps but also in 3D galaxy catalogs,
where it estimates the total length of filaments in the Universe. Making the
link with other works, we also show how the skeleton can be used to study the

magnetic fields, including weak-magnetism and recoil corrections. Since the
weak interaction violates the parity, the scattering cross section
asymmetrically depends on the directions of the neutrino momenta to the
magnetic field; the origin of pulsar kicks may be explained by the mechanism.
An asymmetric neutrino emission (a drift flux) due to neutrino-nucleon
scatterings is absent at the leading level of $\mathcal O(\mu_BB/T)$, where
$\mu_B$ is the nucleon magneton, $B$ is the magnetic field strength, and $T$ is
the matter temperature at a neutrinosphere. This is because at this level the
drift flux of the neutrinos are exactly canceled by that of the antineutrinos.
Hence, the relevant asymmetry in the neutrino emission is suppressed by much
smaller coefficient of $\mathcal O(\mu_BB/m)$, where $m$ is the nucleon mass;
detailed form of the relevant drift flux is also derived from the scattering
cross section, using a simple diffusion approximation. It appears that the
asymmetric neutrino emission is too small to induce the observed pulsar kicks.
However, we note the fact that the drift flux is proportional to the deviation
of the neutrino distribution function from the value of thermal equilibrium at
neutrinosphere. Since the deviation can be large for non-electron neutrinos, it
is expected that there occurs cancellation between the deviation and the small
suppression factor of $\mathcal O(\mu_BB/m)$. Using a simple parameterization,
we show that the drift flux due to neutrino-nucleon scatterings may be
comparable to the leading term due to beta processes with nucleons, which has
been estimated to give a relevant kick velocity when the magnetic field is
sufficiently strong as $10^{15}$--$10^{16}$ G.

action S describes both the average over the Gaussian initial conditions and
the Vlasov-Poisson dynamics. Next, applying a standard method borrowed from
field theory we generalize our problem to an N-field system and we look for an
expansion over powers of 1/N. We describe three such methods and we derive the
corresponding equations of motion at the lowest non-trivial order for the case
of gravitational clustering. This yields a set of non-linear equations for the
mean $\fb$ and the two-point correlation G of the phase-space distribution f,
as well as for the response function R. These systematic schemes match the
usual perturbative expansion on quasi-linear scales but should also be able to

minimising the $\chi^2_M$, the estimator that provides the minimum RMS, either
for those quantities or for the parameters on which these quantities depend. In

is self-regulating, and produces mean supernova rates as part of the solution.
Simulations with differing mean density show a power law relation between the
supernova rate and density, with exponent 1.7; this value is within the range
suggested from observations (taking star formation rate as a proxy for
supernova rate). The global structure of the supernova driven medium is
strongly affected by the presence of magnetic fields; e.g. for one solution the

galaxies where ellipticals experience intense and rapid starbursts within the
first Gyr after their formation, and spirals and irregulars continue to form
stars at lower rates up to the present time. Such models allow one to follow in
detail the evolution of the metallicity of the gas out of which the stars are
formed. We normalize the galaxy population to the B band luminosity function
observed in the local Universe and study the redshift evolution of the
luminosity densities in the B, U, I and K bands calculating galaxy colors and
evolutionary corrections by means of a detailed synthetic stellar population
model. Our predictions indicate that the decline of the galaxy luminosity
density between redshift 1 and 0 observed in the U, B and I bands is caused
mainly by star-forming spiral galaxies which slowly exhaust their gas
reservoirs. Elliptical galaxies have dominated the total luminosity density in
all optical bands at early epochs, when all their stars formed by means of
rapid and very intense star-bursts. Irregular galaxies bring a negligible
contribution to the total luminosity density in any band at any time.

can be reconciled by the fact that the stellar M/L ratio is lower in the

Wormlike Chain Model (WCM) of semiflexible polymers. Our solution to the model
is based on a new computational technique called the Generalized Borel
Transform (GBT) which we use to study the statistical mechanics of semiflexible
polymer chains. Specifically, we evaluate the characteristic function of the
model approximately. Afterward, we compute the polymer propagator of the model
using the GBT and find an expression valid for polymers with any number of

the limits of flexible and infinitely stiff polymers exactly. In between, a
smooth and approximate crossover behavior is predicted. Another property of our
propagator is that it fulfills the condition of finite extensibility of the
polymer chain. We have also calculated the single chain structure factor. This
property is a decreasing function of the wave vector, $k,$ until a plateau is
reached. Our computations clearly show that the structure factor decreases
faster with increasing wave vector when the semiflexibility parameter is
increased. Furthermore, when the wave vector is large enough, there is a regime
where the structure factor follows an approximate power law of the form
$k^{-\theta}$ even for short polymer chains. $\theta$ is equal to two for
flexible polymers and to one for rigid chains. We also compare our results to

sampled by Langevin dynamics. Thermodynamic cooperativity is characterized by
the experimental criteria requiring the van't Hoff to calorimetric enthalpy
ratio $\Delta H_{\rm vH}/\Delta H_{\rm cal}\approx 1$ (the calorimetric
criterion), as well as a two-state-like variation of the average radius of
gyration upon denaturation. We find that both local and nonlocal interactions

weakened local conformational propensities or much weakened favorable nonlocal
interactions are significantly less cooperative than chain models with both

reason it may be viewed as a statistical characterization of nonequivalent
ensembles which extends and complements the common thermodynamic
characterization of nonequivalent ensembles based on nonconcave anomalies of
the microcanonical entropy. By computing numerically both the microcanonical
and canonical sets of equilibrium distributions of states of the BEG model, we
show that for values of the mean energy where the microcanonical entropy is
nonconcave, the microcanonical distributions of states are nowhere realized in
the canonical ensemble. Moreover, we show that for values of the mean energy

microcanonical distributions of states can be put in one-to-one correspondence

superconducting SC states. In order to drive the system through the phase
border P_0(T_0), the sample was maintained at fixed temperature T and pressure
P, whereas the critical pressure P_0 was tuned by applying the magnetic field
B. In this approach, the magnetic field was used (i) for tuning (P-P_0), and
(ii) for identifying the phase composition (due to qualitatively different
magnetoresistance behavior in different phases). Experimentally, we measured
R(B) and its temperature dependence R(B,T) in the pressure range (0 - 1)GPa.
Our studies focus on the features of the magnetoresistance at the phase
transition between the PM and AF phases, in the close vicinity to the
superconducting transition at T~1K. We found pronounced history effects arising
when the AF/PM phase border is crossed by sweeping the magnetic field: the
resistance depends on a trajectory which the system arrives at a given point of
the P-B-T phase space. In the transition from the PM to AF phase, the features
of the PM phase extends well into the AF phase. At the opposite transition from
the AF to PM phase, the features of the AF phase are observed in the PM phase.
These results evidence for a macroscopically inhomogeneous state, which
contains macroscopic inclusions of the minority phase. When the system is
driven away from the transition, the homogeneous state is restored; upon a
return motion to the phase boundary, no signatures of the minority phase are
observed up to the very phase boundary.

a selected list of solutions, which at first sight seem to go against cosmic
censorship, but at the end they fail in some way. However, the space of

increase one's intuition by establishing a link between certain inequalities

reasonable equation of state--which determines whether the space-time is
asymptotically flat or not, an energy condition, and an hypothesis over the
class of metrics on which Einstein's field equations ought to be solved to
ensure strong cosmic censorship inside black-holes. With these tools in hand we

quantum field theory in higher-dimensional space-time with some boundary terms.
The boundary term causes nontrivial consequences about the vacuum structure of
the higher-dimensional theory. We take particular note of two independent
solutions to the weak and Planck hierarchy problem: ``low scale supersymmetry''
and ``dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking.'' From a viewpoint of the low
scale supersymmetry, we study $F$ and $D$ term supersymmetry breaking effects
on sparticle spectra from a boundary. While we also investigate a
nonperturbative effect caused by a bulk (nonsupersymmetric) gauge dynamics on a
fermion bilinear condensation on a boundary, and analyze the dynamical symmetry
breaking on the brane. From these analyses we conclude that the field
localization in higher-dimensional space-time involves in a nontrivial vacuum
structure of the theory, and the resultant low energy four-dimensional
effective theory has phenomenologically interesting structure. In a framework
of purely four-dimensional theory, we also construct the above nontrivial
effect of localization in the extra dimension.

relevance to understand the light scalar mesons since it provides a formalism
that respects chiral symmetry and unitarity and is able to generate resonant
states without any a priori theoretical bias toward their existence,
classification or spectroscopic nature. We will also review how this approach
is also able to describe the thermal evolution of the $\rho$ and $\sigma$

  T. S. Michael and N. Traves (2002) provided examples of well-covered graphs

  A. Finbow, B. Hartnell and R. J. Nowakowski (1993) proved that under certain

well-covered trees (e.g., $P_{n}^{*},K_{1,n}^{*}$, where $P_{n}$ is the path on
$n$ vertices and $K_{1,n}$ is the $n$-star graph).

Matter experiments. The key merit is the capability to differentiate nuclear
recoil (nr) signatures from the background $\beta / \gamma$-events due to
ambient radioactivity on the basis of their different pulse shapes. One of the
major experimental challenges is to perform such pulse shape analysis in the
statistics-limited domain where the light output is close to the detection
threshold. Using data derived from measurements with low energy $\gamma$'s and
nuclear recoils due to neutron elastic scatterings, it was verified that the
pulse shapes between $\beta / \gamma$-events are different. Several methods of
pulse shape discrimination are studied, and their relative merits are compared.
Full digitization of the pulse shapes is crucial to achieve good
discrimination. Advanced software techniques with mean time, neural network and
likelihood ratios give rise to satisfactory performance, and are superior to
the conventional Double Charge method commonly applied at higher energies.
Pulse shape discrimination becomes effective starting at a light yield of about
20 photo-electrons. This corresponds to a detection threshold of about 5 keV
electron-equivalence energy, or 40$-$50 keV recoil kinetic energy, in realistic
experiments.

space as a quantum foam system in which gravity is an inhomogeneous flow of the
quantum foam into matter. The older Newtonian and General Relativity theories
for gravity are analysed. It is shown that Newtonian gravity may be written in
the form of an in-flow. General Relativity is also analysed as an in-flow, for
those cases where it has been tested. An analysis of various experimental data
demonstrates that absolute motion relative to space has been observed by
Michelson and Morley, Miller, Illingworth, Jaseja et al, Torr and Kolen, and by
DeWitte. The Dayton Miller and Roland DeWitte data also reveal the in-flow of
space into matter which manifests as gravity. The experimental data suggests
that the in-flow is turbulent, which amounts to the observation of a
gravitational wave phenomena. A new in-flow theory of gravity is proposed which
passes all the tests that General Relativity was claimed to have passed, but as
well the new theory suggests that the so-called spiral galaxy rotation-velocity
anomaly may be explained without the need of `dark matter'. Various other
gravitational anomalies also appear to be explainable. Newtonian gravity
appears to be strictly valid only outside of spherically symmetric matter
systems.

quantized cavity field. For all the atoms initially in their ground states, it
is shown that spin squeezing of both the atoms and the field can be achieved
provided the initial state of the cavity field has coherence between number
states differing by 2. Most of the discussion is restricted to the case of a
cavity field initially in a coherent state, but initial squeezed states for the
field are also discussed. Optimal conditions for obtaining squeezing are
obtained. An analytic solution is found that is valid in the limit that the
number of atoms is much greater than unity and is also much larger than the
average number of photons, inititally in the coherent state of the cavity
field. In this limit, the degree of spin squeezing increases with increasing a,
even though the field more closely resembles a classical field for which no
spin squeezing could be achieved.

of activity: in June, the X-ray spectrum was faint and hard (alpha sim 0.8),
with positive residuals towards low energies. In October we detected the
highest [2-10] keV flux ever measured for the source. During this observation,
the spectrum was soft (alpha sim 1.56) up to 10 keV, while above this energy a
hard component was dominating. The BeppoSAX data are confirmed by simultaneous
RXTE short observations. During the first observation the soft X-ray flux was
variable on timescales of a few hours, while the hard X-ray flux was almost
constant. During the second observation, instead, the soft spectrum displayed
an erratic behaviour with large variations (up to factors 3-4) on timescales
smaller than 2 hrs. The analysis of the multiwavelength SED of October
evidenced an intriguing feature: the optical and X-ray sections of the SED are
misaligned, while in the prevailing standard picture, they are both thought to
be produced via synchrotron emission. We suggested four scenarios to account
for this discrepancy: a higher than galactic dust-to-gas ratio towards the
source, the first detection of bulk Compton emission in the X-ray band, the
presence of two synchrotron emitting regions located at different distances
from the nucleus, the detection of a Klein-Nishina effect on the synchrotron
spectrum. We evidenced the favorable and critical points of each scenario, but,
at present, we cannot discriminate between them.

These new companions eventually overflow their Roche lobes because of
encounters and tides. The millisecond pulsars eject the overflowing gas from
the binary, giving mass loss on the binary evolution timescale. The systems are
only observable as BWPs at epochs where this evolution is slow, making the mass
loss transparent and the lifetime long. This explains why observed BWPs have

a rich population of luminous clusters with a flatter luminosity function. The
strong, ongoing encounter in NGC 6621/2, seen about 10^8 years past closest

luminous clusters, particularly young and bright in a small region between the

rotation curve reverses sign. Cluster formation requires a threshold level of
perturbation, with stage of the interaction less important. The location of the
most active star formation in NGC 6621/2 draws attention to a possible role for
the Toomre stability threshold in shaping star formation in interacting
galaxies. The rich cluster populations in NGC 5752 and 6621 show that direct
contact between gas-rich galaxy disks is not a requirement to form luminous

from a companion exhibit thermonuclear X-ray bursts that last tens of seconds,
caused by unstable nuclear burning on their surfaces. Millisecond brightness
oscillations during bursts from ten NSs (as distinct from other rapid X-ray
variability that is also observed) are thought to measure the stellar spin, but
direct proof of a rotational origin has been lacking. Here, we report the
detection of burst oscillations at the known spin frequency of an accreting
millisecond pulsar, and we show that these oscillations always have the same
rotational phase. This firmly establishes burst oscillations as nuclear-powered
pulsations tracing the spin of accreting NSs, corroborating earlier evidence.
The distribution of spin frequencies of the 11 nuclear-powered pulsars cuts off
well below the breakup frequency for most NS models, supporting theoretical
predictions that gravitational radiation losses can limit accretion torques in
spinning up millisecond pulsars.

  revisions to match the version in press","Astrophys.J.610:61-68,2004","10.1086/421542",,"astro-ph",,"  Daddi et al. have recently reported strong clustering of a population of red
galaxies at z~3 in the Hubble Deep Field-South. Fitting the observed angular
clustering with a power law of index -0.8, they infer a comoving correlation
length r_0~8 Mpc/h; for a standard cosmology, this r_0 would imply that the red
galaxies reside in rare, M>10^{13} Msun/h halos, with each halo hosting ~100
galaxies to match the number density of the population. Using the framework of
the halo occupation distribution (HOD) in a $\Lambda$CDM universe, we show that
the Daddi et al. data can be adequately reproduced by less surprising models,
e.g., models with galaxies residing in halos of mass M>M_min=6.3x10^{11} Msun/h
and a mean occupation Navg(M)=1.4(M/M_min)^{0.45} above this cutoff. The
resultant correlation functions do not follow a strict power law, showing
instead a clear transition from the 1-halo dominated regime, where the two
galaxies of each pair reside in the same dark matter halo, to the 2-halo
dominated regime, where the two galaxies of each pair are from different halos.
The observed high-amplitude data points lie in the one-halo-dominated regime,
so these HOD models are able to explain the observations despite having smaller
correlation lengths, r_0~5 Mpc/h. HOD parameters are only loosely constrained
by the current data because of large sample variance and the lack of clustering
information on scales that probe the 2-halo regime. If our explanation of the
data is correct, then future observations covering a larger area should show
that the large scale correlations lie below a \theta^{-1.8} extrapolation of
the small scale points. Our models of the current data suggest that the red
galaxies are somewhat more strongly clustered than UV-selected Lyman-break
galaxies and have a greater tendency to reside in small groups.

number density is consistent with that predicted by the small comet hypothesis.
The images used for the search were the same as those obtained in a previous
unsuccessful optical search for small comets reported by Mutel and Fix (2000,
JGRSP,105,24907; MF). The results of these two independent analyses of the same
image dataset are not formally in disagreement, since all detections reported
by FS are fainter than the minimum detectable magnitude limit (16.5) determined
by MF. However, since the conclusions are quite different, we have
independently re-analyzed the original search images for evidence of the faint
detections reported by FS. In particular, we have carefully examined whether
the three putative trails whose positions are available satisfy several
necessary criteria for a candidate grouping of excess-count pixels to be caused
by a celestial object. While we have not evaluated the formal statistical
significance of faint detections, all three claimed detections fail one or more
independent criteria required for a valid detection. In addition, both the

space interferometry missions is included. We pause both to reflect on decades
of immense progress in the field as well as to prepare for a new generation of
large interferometers just now being commissioned (most notably, the CHARA,
Keck and VLT Interferometers). First, this review summarizes the basic
principles behind stellar interferometry needed by the lay-physicist and
general astronomer to understand the scientific potential as well as technical
challenges of interferometry. Next, the basic design principles of practical
interferometers are discussed, using the experience of past and existing
facilities to illustrate important points. Here there is significant discussion
of current trends in the field, including the new facilities under construction
and advanced technologies being debuted. This decade has seen the influence of
stellar interferometry extend beyond classical regimes of stellar diameters and
binary orbits to new areas such as mapping the accretion disks around young
stars, novel calibration of the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation, and imaging
of stellar surfaces. The third section is devoted to the major scientific
results from interferometry, grouped into natural categories reflecting these
current developments. Lastly, I consider the future of interferometry,
highlighting the kinds of new science promised by the interferometers coming
on-line in the next few years. I also discuss the longer-term future of optical
interferometry, including the prospects for space interferometry and the
possibilities of large-scale ground-based projects. Critical technological
developments are still needed to make these projects attractive and affordable.

two main results are that (a) the production of atomic hydrogen in the

the Galaxy for all of the trajectories. We then select some of them so that the
resultant mapping of the velocity directions outside the Galaxy of the selected

Liouville's theorem. We also consider energy loss processes of UHE protons in
the intergalactic space. Applying this method to our source location scenario
which is adopted in our recent study and can explain the AGASA observation

reproduce the large-scale isotropy and the small-scale anisotropy on UHECR

the UHECR arrival distribution above 10^19 eV with the event number expected by
future experiments in the next few years. The interesting feature of the
resultant arrival distribution is the arrangement of the clustered events in
the order of their energies, reflecting the directions of the galactic magnetic
field. This is also pointed out by Alvarez-Muniz et al.(2002). This feature
will allow us to obtain some kind of information about the composition of

The spherical 'shell', defined for example by the particles turning at a given

sub-DLA range (10^19<N(HI)<2*10^20 cm^{-2}), which are systems believed to
contain a large fraction of the neutral hydrogen at z>3.5. In this paper, we
use a homogeneous sample of sub-DLAs from the ESO UVES archives presented in

first time the column density distribution, f(N), down to N(HI)=10^19 cm^{-2}.
The results are in good agreement with the predictions from Peroux et al.

compare low- and high-ionization transition widths and find that the sub-DLAs
properties roughly span the parameter space of DLAs. We analyse the chemical
content of this sample in conjunction with abundances from 72 DLAs taken from
the literature. We compute the HI column density-weighted mean abundance which
is believed to be an indicator of the Universe's metallicity. Although the
number statistics is limited, the results suggest a slightly stronger evolution
in the sub-DLA range. The evolution we probe is not due to their lower dust
content. Therefore these systems might be associated with a different class of
objects which better trace the overall chemical evolution of the Universe.
Finally, we present abundance ratios of [Si/Fe], [O/Fe], [C/Fe] and [Al/Fe],
but it is difficult to decipher whether the observed values are the effect of
nucleosynthesis or are due to differential dust depletion. The metallicities
are compared with two different sets of models of galaxy evolution in order to

These ALS are lattice-specific and have no analog in the continuum. Our

the different contributions [atom-atom (AA), vibration-rotation (VR) and
resonant transfer] and their cross-correlations. Following Everitt and Skinner,
we have included the vibrational coordinate ($q$) dependence of the interatomic
potential. It is found that the latter makes an important contribution. The
principal important results are: (a) a crossover from a Lorentzian-type to a
Gaussian line shape is observed as the critical point is approached along the
isochore (from above), (b) the root mean square frequency fluctuation shows
nonmonotonic dependence on the temperature along critical isochore, (c) along
the coexistence line and the critical isochore the temperature dependent
linewidth shows a divergence-like $\lambda$-shape behavior, and (d) the value
of the critical exponents along the coexistence and along the isochore are
obtained by fitting. The origin of the anomalous temperature dependence of
linewidth can be traced to simultaneous occurrence of several factors, (i) the
enhancement of negative cross-correlations between AA and VR contributions and
(ii) the large density fluctuations as the critical point (CP) is approached.
The former makes the decay faster so that local density fluctuations are probed
on a femtosecond time scale. A mode coupling theory (MCT) analysis shows the
slow decay of the enhanced density fluctuations near critical point. The MCT
analysis demonstrates that the large enhancement of VR coupling near CP arises
from the non-Gaussian behavior of density fluctuation and this enters through a
nonzero value of the triplet direct correlation function.

macroscopic constraint like a dividing surface, or the enforcement of gradients
of the energy/particle reduce the entropy. As will be shown here, when removing
such constraint in regions of a negative heat capacity, the system may even
relax under a flow of heat against the temperature slope. Thus Clausius

violated. However, the Second Law is still satisfied and the total

IceCube, to measure the flavor ratios of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos.
The expected flavor ratios at the sources are
$\phi_{\nu_e}:\phi_{\nu_{\mu}}:\phi_{\nu_{\tau}} = 1:2:0$, and neutrino
oscillations quickly transform these to $1:1:1$. The flavor ratios can be
deduced from the relative rates of showers ($\nu_e$ charged-current, most
$\nu_\tau$ charged-current, and all flavors neutral-current), muon tracks
($\nu_\mu$ charged-current only), and tau lepton lollipops and double-bangs
($\nu_\tau$ charged-current only). The peak sensitivities for these
interactions are at different neutrino energies, but the flavor ratios can be
reliably connected by a reasonable measurement of the spectrum shape.
Measurement of the astrophysical neutrino flavor ratios tests the assumed
production mechanism and also provides a very long baseline test of a number of
exotic scenarios, including neutrino decay, CPT violation, and small-$\delta

clusters are the primary units of hadronization, then the electric charge is
necessarily compensated locally at the scale of the typical cluster mass. As a
result, the minijet electric charge is suppressed at scales that are greater
than the cluster mass. We hence argue, and demonstrate by means of Monte Carlo
simulations using HERWIG, that the scale at which charge compensation is
violated is close to the mass of the clusters involved in hadronization, and
its measurement would provide a clue to resolving the nature of the dynamics.
We repeat the calculation using PYTHIA and find that the numbers produced by
the two generators are similar. The cluster mass distribution is sensitive to
soft emission that is considered unresolved in the parton shower phase. We
discuss how the description of the splitting of large clusters in terms of
unresolved emission modifies the algorithm of HERWIG, and relate the findings
to the yet unknown underlying nonperturbative mechanism. In particular, we
propose a form of $\alpha_S$ that follows from a power-enhanced beta function,
and discuss how this $\alpha_S$ that governs unresolved emission may be related
to power corrections. Our findings are in agreement with experimental data.

modes (QNM's) may provide a link between classical general relativity and
quantum gravity, we present an extensive computation of highly damped QNM's of
Kerr black holes. We do not limit our attention to gravitational modes, thus
filling some gaps in the existing literature. The frequency of gravitational
modes with l=m=2 tends to \omega_R=2 \Omega, \Omega being the angular velocity
of the black hole horizon. If Hod's conjecture is valid, this asymptotic
behaviour is related to reversible black hole transformations. Other highly
damped modes with m>0 that we computed do not show a similar behaviour. The
real part of modes with l=2 and m<0 seems to asymptotically approach a constant
value \omega_R\simeq -m\varpi, \varpi\simeq 0.12 being (almost) independent of
a. For any perturbing field, trajectories in the complex plane of QNM's with
m=0 show a spiralling behaviour, similar to the one observed for
Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black holes. Finally, for any perturbing field, the
asymptotic separation in the imaginary part of consecutive modes with m>0 is
given by 2\pi T_H (T_H being the black hole temperature). We conjecture that
for all values of l and m>0 there is an infinity of modes tending to the
critical frequency for superradiance (\omega_R=m) in the extremal limit.
Finally, we study in some detail modes branching off the so--called
``algebraically special frequency'' of Schwarzschild black holes. For the first
time we find numerically that QNM multiplets emerge from the algebraically
special Schwarzschild modes, confirming a recent speculation.

extension. Whereas the tension of the bona fide (stable) QCD string is expected
to depend only on the N-ality of the representation, tensions that depend on
specific representation R are often reported in the lattice literature. In
particular, adjoint strings are discussed and found in certain simulations. We
clarify this issue by systematically exploiting the notion of the quasi-stable
strings which becomes well-defined at large N. The quasi-stable strings with
representation-dependent tensions decay, but the decay rate (per unit length
per unit time) is suppressed as Lambda^2 F(N) where F(N) falls off as a
function of N. It can be determined on the case-by-case basis. The quasi-stable
strings eventually decay into stable strings whose tension indeed depends only
on the N-ality.

the string tension cannot be correct, and present additional arguments in favor
of the sine formula. Finally, we comment on the relevance of our estimates to

nuclei. Following the Dirac picture such a potential polarizes the vacuum. The
polarization density as derived in physics literature, after a well known
renormalization procedure, depends decisively on the strength of $\lambda$. For
small $\lambda$, more precisely as long as the lowest eigenvalue,
$e_1(\lambda)$, of the corresponding Dirac operator stays in the gap of the
essential spectrum, the integral over the density vanishes. In other words the
vacuum stays neutral. But as soon as $e_1(\lambda)$ dives into the lower
continuum the vacuum gets spontaneously charged with charge $ 2e$. Global
charge conservation implies that two positrons were emitted out of the vacuum,
this is, a large enough external potential can produce electron-positron pairs.

invariance of a Lagrangian vanishes on shell modulo a divergence of an

Lagrangians yields, however, meaningful (and measurable) currents. The well
known solution to this ``paradox'' is to involve the variation of the metric
tensor. Such procedure, for the field considered on a fixed (flat) background,
is sophisticated logically (one need to introduce the variation of a fixed
field) and formal.
  We analyze the Noether procedure for a generic diffeomorphism invariant
$p$-form field model. We show that the Noether current of the field considered
on a variable background coincides with the current treated in a fixed
geometry. Consistent description of the canonical energy-momentum current is
possible only if the dynamics of the geometry (gravitation) is taken into
account. However, even the ``truncated'' consideration yields the proper
expression. We examine the examples of the free $p$-form gauge field theory,
the GR in the coframe representation and the metric-free electrodynamics.
Although, the variation of a metric tensor is not acceptable in the latter
case, the Noether procedure yields the proper result.

self-interest and internalized social norms which cannot be accounted for by
the Nash equilibrium behavior of Homo Oeconomicus. This led to the notion of
strong reciprocity (or altruistic punishment) to capture the human trait
leading an individual to punish norm violators at a cost to himself. For a
population with small autonomous groups with collective monitoring, the
interplay of intra- and intergroup dynamics shows this to be an adaptive trait,
although not fully invasive of a selfish population. However, the absence of
collective monitoring in a larger society changes the evolution dynamics.
Clustering seems to be the network parameter that controls maintenance and
evolution of the reciprocator trait.

alternating field or thermal cleaning the directions of remanence are generally
well clustered within flow units. In contrast, the thermal instability of the
samples did not allow to obtain reliable paleointensity determinations. The
geomagnetic transition is incompletely recorded due to a gap in volcanic
activity attested both by eolian deposits and a large angular distance between
the field directions of the flows underlying or overlying these deposits. The
transition path is noticeably different from that reported in the pioneer work

observed after the volcanic hiatus. Once continents are replaced in their
relative position 180 Ma ago, the post-hiatus VGP cluster over Russia. However,
two successive rebounds from that cluster are found, with VGP reaching
repeatedly Eastern Asia coast. Thus, the VGP path is not narrowly constrained
in paleolongitude. The decrease in intensity of magnetization as the field
deviates from the normal or reversed direction suggests that the decrease in
field magnitude during the reversal reached 80-90%. We conclude that although

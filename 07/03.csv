  modifications",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We here propose that the large scale superluminal ejections observed in the
galactic microquasar GRS 1915+105 during radio flare events are produced by
violent magnetic reconnection episodes in the corona just above the inner edge
of the magnetized accretion disk that surrounds the central $\sim 10 M_{\odot}$
black hole. The process occurs when a large scale magnetic field is established
by turbulent dynamo in the inner disk region with a ratio between the
gas$+$radiation and the magnetic pressures $\beta \simeq 1$, implying a
magnetic field intensity of $\sim 7 \times 10^8$ G. During this process,
substantial angular momentum is removed from the disk by the wind generated by
the vertical magnetic flux therefore increasing the disk mass accretion to a
value near (but below) the critical one ($\dot M \sim 10^{19} $ g s$^{-1}$).
Part of the magnetic energy released by reconnection heats the coronal gas
($T_c \lesssim 5 \times 10^8 $ K) that produces a steep, soft X-ray spectrum
with luminosity $L_X \simeq 10^{39} $ erg s$^{- 1}$, in consistency with
observations. The remaining magnetic energy released goes to accelerate the
particles to relativistic velocities ($v \sim v_A \sim c$, where $v_A$ is the
Alfv\'en speed) in the reconnection site through first-order Fermi processes.
In this context, two possible mechanisms have been examined which produce
power-law electron distributions $N(E) \propto E^{-\alpha_E}$, with $\alpha_E =
5/2, 2$, and corresponding synchrotron radio power-law spectra with spectral
indices which are compatible with that observed during the flares ($ S_{\nu}

the critical magnetic Reynolds number to increase with decreasing magnetic
Prandtl number. The Kazantsev $k^{3/2}$ spectrum for magnetic energy is
confirmed for the kinematic regime, i.e. when nonlinear effects are still
unimportant and when the magnetic Prandtl number is unity. In the nonlinear
regime, the energy budget converges for large Reynolds numbers (around 1000)
such that for our parameters about 70% is in kinetic energy and about 30% is in
magnetic energy. The energy dissipation rates are converged to 30% viscous
dissipation and 70% resistive dissipation. Second order structure functions of
the Elsasser variables give evidence for a $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum. Nevertheless,
the three-dimensional spectrum is close to $k^{-3/2}$, but we argue that this
is due to the bottleneck effect. The bottleneck effect is shown to be equally
strong both for magnetic and nonmagnetic turbulence, but it is far weaker in
one-dimensional spectra that are normally studied in laboratory turbulence.
Structure function exponents for other orders are well described by the
She-Leveque formula, but the velocity field is significantly less intermittent
and the magnetic field is more intermittent than the Elsasser variables.

both the v=0 and v=1 vibrational levels, with 0.5 arcsec resolution. The
intense v=1 masers are confined to a narrow zone 40 AU from the star. Their
polarization position angles vary significantly on time scales of years. For
the v=1 masers the stimulated emission rate R is likely to exceed the Zeeman
splitting g\Omega due to any plausible magnetic field; in this case the maser
polarization need not correlate with the field direction. The much weaker v=0
masers in the ground vibrational level lie 100-700 AU from IRc2, in what
appears to be a flared disk. Their fractional polarizations are as high as 50%.
The polarization position angles vary little across the line profile or the
emission region, and appear to be stable in time. The position angle, P.A. = 80
degrees, we measure for the J=2-1 masers differs by 70 degrees from that
measured for the J=1-0 SiO transition, possibly because of Faraday rotation in
the foreground, Orion A, HII region. A rotation measure RM = 3.3 \times 10^4

involving low-mass main-sequence stars. Using both Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) calculations and a much faster fluid sorting software
package (MMAS), we study scenarios in which a newly formed product from an
initial collision collides with a third parent star. By varying the order in
which the parent stars collide, as well as the orbital parameters of the
collision trajectories, we investigate how factors such as shock heating affect
the chemical composition and structure profiles of the collision product. Our
simulations and models indicate that the distribution of most chemical elements
within the final product is not significantly affected by the order in which
the stars collide, the direction of approach of the third parent star, or the
periastron separations of the collisions. We find that the sizes of the
products, and hence their collisional cross sections for subsequent encounters,
are sensitive to the order and geometry of the collisions. For the cases that
we consider, the radius of the product formed in the first (single-single star)
collision ranges anywhere from roughly 2 to 30 times the sum of the radii of
its parent stars. The final product formed in our triple-star collisions can
easily be as large or larger than a typical red giant. We therefore expect the
collisional cross section of a newly formed product to be greatly enhanced over
that of a thermally relaxed star of the same mass.

by a generalized Langevin equation with a frequency-dependent friction
coefficient proportional to $|\omega|^{\delta-1}$ at small frequencies, with
$0<\delta<2$. The aging properties of the medium are encoded in a frequency
dependent effective temperature $T_{\rm eff.}(\omega)$. The latter is modelized
by a function proportional to $|\omega|^\alpha$ at small frequencies, with
$\alpha<0$, thus allowing for the medium to have a density of slow modes
proportionally larger than in a thermal bath. Using asymptotic Fourier
analysis, we obtain the behaviour at large times of the velocity correlation
function and of the mean square displacement. As a result, the anomalous
diffusion exponent in the aging medium appears to be linked, not only to

nucleic acid (DNA) molecule from a salt solution is investigated by computer
simulation. The ions are modelled as charged hard spheres, the DNA molecule as
a point charge pattern following the double-helical phosphate strands. The
geometrical shape of the DNA molecules is modelled on different levels ranging
from a simple cylindrical shape to structured models which include the major
and minor grooves between the phosphate strands. The densities of the ions
adsorbed on the phosphate strands, in the major and in the minor grooves are
calculated. First, we find that the adsorption pattern on the DNA surface
depends strongly on its geometrical shape: counterions adsorb preferentially
along the phosphate strands for a cylindrical model shape, but in the minor
groove for a geometrically structured model. Second, we find that an addition
of monovalent salt ions results in an increase of the charge density in the
minor groove while the total charge density of ions adsorbed in the major
groove stays unchanged. The adsorbed ion densities are highly structured along
the minor groove while they are almost smeared along the major groove.
Furthermore, for a fixed amount of added salt, the major groove cationic charge
is independent on the counterion valency. For increasing salt concentration the
major groove is neutralized while the total charge adsorbed in the minor groove
is constant. DNA overcharging is detected for multivalent salt. Simulations for
a larger ion radii, which mimic the effect of the ion hydration, indicate an
increased adsorbtion of cations in the major groove.

The complexity of manipulating realistic elections where the number of
candidates is a small constant was recently studied (Conitzer 2002), but the
emphasis was on the question of whether or not a protocol becomes hard to
manipulate for some constant number of candidates. That work, in many cases,
left open the question: How many candidates are needed to make elections hard
to manipulate? This is a crucial question when comparing the relative
manipulability of different voting protocols. In this paper we answer that
question for the voting protocols of the earlier study: plurality, Borda, STV,
Copeland, maximin, regular cup, and randomized cup. We also answer that
question for two voting protocols for which no results on the complexity of
manipulation have been derived before: veto and plurality with runoff. It turns
out that the voting protocols under study become hard to manipulate at 3
candidates, 4 candidates, 7 candidates, or never.

and a point p, find a point on C nearest to p or farthest from p. In the
general black-box model, no algorithm can solve these problems. Assuming a
known bound on the speed of the curve (a Lipschitz condition), the answer can
be estimated up to an additive error of epsilon using O(1/epsilon) samples, and
this bound is tight in the worst case. However, many instances can be solved
with substantially fewer samples, and we give algorithms that adapt to the
inherent difficulty of the particular instance, up to a logarithmic factor.
More precisely, if OPT(C,p,epsilon) is the minimum number of samples of C that
every correct algorithm must perform to achieve tolerance epsilon, then our
algorithm performs O(OPT(C,p,epsilon) log (epsilon^(-1)/OPT(C,p,epsilon)))
samples. Furthermore, any algorithm requires Omega(k log (epsilon^(-1)/k))
samples for some instance C' with OPT(C',p,epsilon) = k; except that, for the
nearest-point-on-curve problem when the distance between C and p is less than
epsilon, OPT is 1 but the upper and lower bounds on the number of samples are
both Theta(1/epsilon). When bounds on relative error are desired, we give
algorithms that perform O(OPT log (2+(1+epsilon^(-1)) m^(-1)/OPT)) samples

Omega(OPT log (1/epsilon)) samples are necessary on some problem instances.

learn about the game so as to avoid future losses (this is consistent with the
Win or Learn Fast (WoLF) principle; BL stands for ``bounded loss''). Our
framework allows for both probabilistic and approximate learning. The resultant
notion of {\em BL-WoLF}-learnability can be applied to any class of games, and
allows us to measure the inherent disadvantage to a player that does not know

believed to hold on an event horizon arising from the collapse of an
asymptotically flat Cauchy surface. We establish that the heuristic mass
inflation scenario put forth by Israel and Poisson is mathematically correct in
the context of this initial value problem. In particular, the maximal domain of
development has a future boundary, over which the spacetime is extendible as a
continuous metric, but along which the Hawking mass blows up identically; thus,
the spacetime is inextendible as a differentiable metric. In view of recent
results of the author in collaboration with I. Rodnianski (gr-qc/0309115),
which rigorously establish the validity of Price's law as an upper bound for
the decay of scalar field hair, the continuous extendibility result applies to
the collapse of complete asymptotically flat spacelike data where the scalar
field is compactly supported on the initial hypersurface. This shows that under
Christodoulou's C^0 formulation, the strong cosmic censorship conjecture is
false for this system.

massless flavors. Universality arguments show that a continuous (second-order)
transition must be related to a 3-D universality class characterized by a
complex N_f X N_f matrix order parameter and by the symmetry-breaking pattern
[SU(N_f)_L X SU(N_f)_R]/Z(N_f)_V -> SU(N_f)_V/Z(N_f)_V, or [U(N_f)_L X
U(N_f)_R]/U(1)_V -> U(N_f)_V/U(1)_V if the U(1)_A symmetry is effectively
restored at T_c. The existence of any of these universality classes requires
the presence of a stable fixed point in the corresponding 3-D Phi^4 theory with
the expected symmetry-breaking pattern. Otherwise, the transition is of first
order. In order to search for stable fixed points in these Phi^4 theories, we
exploit a 3-D perturbative approach in which physical quantities are expanded
in powers of appropriate renormalized quartic couplings. We compute the
corresponding Callan-Symanzik beta-functions to six loops. We also determine
the large-order behavior to further constrain the analysis. No stable fixed
point is found, except for N_f=2, corresponding to the symmetry-breaking
pattern [SU(2)_L X SU(2)_R]/Z(2)_V -> SU(2)_V/Z(2)_V equivalent to O(4) ->
O(3). Our results confirm and put on a firmer ground earlier analyses performed
close to four dimensions, based on first-order calculations in the framework of
the epsilon=4-d expansion. These results indicate that the finite-temperature
phase transition in QCD is of first order for N_f>2. A continuous transition is
allowed only for N_f=2. But, since the theory with symmetry-breaking pattern
[U(2)_L X U(2)_R]/U(1)_V -> U(2)_V/U(1)_V does not have stable fixed points,
the transition can be continuous only if the effective breaking of the U(1)_A
symmetry is sufficiently large.

corrections involving real photon production. It is concluded that the previous
estimates of the QED theoretical uncertainty on the LEP2 W-mass measurement may
be too small. A simple procedure for approximating the effect of the kinematic

originate from IR physics below the Planck scale, they will dominate over any
trans-Planckian imprints in any theory which obeys decoupling. Inflation sweeps
away these initial deviations and forces its quantum state closer to the
thermal vacuum. We view this as the quantum version of the cosmic no-hair
theorem. Such imprints in the CMB may be a useful, independent test of the
duration of inflation, or of significant features in the inflaton potential
about 60 e-folds before inflation ended, instead of an unlikely discovery of
the signatures of quantum gravity. The absence of any such substructure would
suggest that inflation lasted uninterrupted much longer than ${\cal O}(100)$

that the energy spectrum of this string theory matches the dimensions of
operators in the appropriately defined large R-charge large-N_c sector of N=4

deletion/restriction construction used in the study of hyperplane arrangements
to elementary modifications of bundles. This allows us to obtain bounds on the
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of D(A). We also give simple combinatorial
conditions for the associated bundle to be stable, and describe its jump lines.
These regularity bounds and stability considerations impose constraints on

of this approach uses cells with different morphology and size, or atom

mean field theory plus Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer(BCS) approximation with a
constant pairing strength. The study is performed in an effective Lagrangian
with the parameter set NL3 for neutron rich even-even Ni isotopes. The results
show that the contribution of the proper treatment of the resonant continuum to
pairing correlations for those nuclei close to neutron drip line is important.
The pairing gaps, Fermi energies, pairing correlation energies, and binding
energies are considerably affected with a proper consideration of the width of
resonant states. The problem of an unphysical particle gas, which may appear in
the calculation of the traditional mean field plus BCS method for nuclei in the
vicinity of drip line could be well overcome when the pairing correlation is
performed by using the resonant states instead of the discretized states in the

equipment and insertion devices. One of the straight sections is intended for a
10 T superconducting wiggler (wavelength shifter) and one for the undulator
with 150 periods and a magnetic field of 0.75 T. The wiggler will influence
many aspects of beam dynamics: linear motion, dynamic aperture, emittance,
damping times etc. The problem is rather serious for the DELSY machine because
the energy of the electron beam is small while the wiggler's magnetic field is
strong. In this paper we consider two models of the wiggler's magnetic field
with and without the focusing caused by the sextupolar field of the wiggler as
we need to develop the requirements to the wiggler design. We study the

  unaffected. This version addresses this issue and discusses in detail the
  complexity and physical consequences of this ""ambiguity""",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC",,"  We introduce a model of computation based on quaternions, which is inspired
on the quantum computing model. Pure states are vectors of a suitable linear
space over the quaternions. Other aspects of the theory are the same as in
quantum computing: superposition and linearity of the state space, unitarity of
the transformations, and projective measurements. However, one notable
exception is the fact that quaternionic circuits do not have a uniquely defined
behaviour, unless a total ordering of evaluation of the gates is defined. Given
such an ordering a unique unitary operator can be associated with the
quaternionic circuit and a proper semantics of computation can be associated
with it.
  The main result of this paper consists in showing that this model is no more
powerful than quantum computing, as long as such an ordering of gates can be
defined. More concretely we show, that for all quaternionic computation using n
quaterbits, the behaviour of the circuit for each possible gate ordering can be
simulated with n+1 qubits, and this with little or no overhead in circuit size.
The proof of this result is inspired of a new simplified and improved proof of
the equivalence of a similar model based on real amplitudes to quantum
computing, which states that any quantum computation using n qubits can be
simulated with n+1 rebits, and in this with no circuit size overhead.
  Beyond this potential computational equivalence, however, we propose this
model as a simpler framework in which to discuss the possibility of a
quaternionic quantum mechanics or information theory. In particular, it already
allows us to illustrate that the introduction of quaternions might violate some
of the ``natural'' properties that we have come to expect from physical models.

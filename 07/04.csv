galaxies Abell 1367 (Sakai et al. 2002) is confirmed with independent imaging
and spectroscopic observations and further investigated in the present
analysis. Two giant and ten dwarf/HII galaxies, members to a group, are
simultaneously undergoing a burst of star formation. Redshift measurements
suggest that the group galaxies are in the process of falling into the cluster
at very high speed. We explore two possible mechanisms that could have
triggered the short-lived stellar burst we are witnessing: the first, internal
to the group itself, via tidal interactions among its members, the hypothesis
favoured by Sakai et al. (2002); the second associated with the high velocity
infall of the group galaxies into the cluster intergalactic medium. We present
evidences in favour and against the two hypotheses.

In addition CMB observations now have sufficient accuracy to not only determine
the total baryon density, but also resolve its principal constituents, H and

emphasis on the concordance with BBN theory and light element observations. We

the inclusion of BBN theory priors significantly reduces the volume of

provide complete tables of all the existing measurements, converted into the
UBVRcIc Johnson-Cousins system wherever necessary. By using as reference the
intrinsic luminosity functions per morphological type measured from local
galaxy concentrations (Jerjen et al 1997), I establish that the variations in
the luminosity functions from survey to survey and among the galaxy classes are
related to the criteria for galaxy classification used in the surveys, as these
determine the amount of mixing of the morphological types within a given class.
When using a spectral classification with inaccurate spectrophotometric
calibrations, the luminosity functions are biased by type contamination with a
smooth variation from type to type poorly related to the intrinsic luminosity
functions per morphological type. In the case of multi-fiber spectroscopy,
galaxy classification based on rest-frame colors might then provide better
estimates of the intrinsic luminosity functions. All the existing surveys fail
to measure the Gaussian luminosity functions for Spiral galaxies. Most surveys
based on visual morphological classification also have their E/S0 luminosity
functions contaminated at the faint end, except for analyses based on either
multi-slit spectroscopy or medium-filter spectrophotometry combined with CCD
photometry. These contamination effects are presumably due to dwarf galaxies.
Measuring reliable intrinsic luminosity functions will thus require a more
coherent approach in separating the giant and dwarf galaxy types.

sample of 29,469 elliptical galaxies culled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
We model ellipticals as a stellar Hernquist profile embedded in an
adiabatically compressed dark matter halo. This model allows us to estimate a
dynamical mass ($M_{dynm}$) at the half-light radius from the velocity
dispersion of the spectra, and to compare these to the stellar mass estimates
($M_{*}$) from Kauffmann et al (2003). We find that $M_{*}/L$ is independent of
luminosity, while $M_{dynm}/L$ increases with luminosity, implying that the
dark matter fraction increases with luminosity. We also observe that at a fixed
luminosity or stellar mass, the dark matter fraction increases with increasing
galaxy size or, equivalently, increases with decreasing surface brightness:
high surface brightness galaxies show almost no evidence for dark matter, while
in low surface brightness galaxies, the dark matter exceeds the stellar mass at
the half light radius. We relate this to the fundamental plane of elliptical
galaxies, suggesting that the tilt of this plane from simple virial predictions
is due to the dark matter in galaxies. We find that a simple model where
galaxies are embedded in dark matter halos and have a star formation efficiency
independent of their surface brightness explains these trends. We estimate the
virial mass of ellipticals as being approximately 7-30 times their stellar
mass, with the lower limit suggesting almost all of the gas within the virial
radius is converted into stars.

line strengths indicate that the atmosphere is N-rich and C-poor, and we

pattern is also found in the stellar wind P Cygni lines of N V 1240 and C IV

O-star was born as a rapid rotator, or the O-star may have accreted N-rich gas
prior to a common-envelope interaction with the progenitor of the supernova. We
re-evaluated the orbital elements to find an orbital period of P=4.4267 +/-
0.0010 d. We compared the spectral line profiles with new non-LTE,
line-blanketed model spectra, from which we derive an effective temperature
T_eff = 37.5 +/- 1.7 kK, gravity log g = 4.0 +/- 0.1, and projected rotational
velocity V sin i = 140 +/- 8 km/s. We fit the UV, optical, and IR flux

M_X/M_sun = 1.4 +/- 0.4, consistent with its identification as a neutron star.
The observed eccentricity and runaway velocity of the binary can only be
reconciled if the neutron star received a modest kick velocity due to a slight
asymmetry in the supernova explosion (during which >5 solar masses was
ejected).

AGN accretion disc. We analyze the dynamics of a disc forming around a
supermassive black hole, in which the angular momentum is transported by
turbulence induced by the disc's self-gravity. We find that once the surface
density of the disc exceeds a critical value, the disc fragments into dense
clumps. The biggest clumps collapse and form massive stars, which produce
few-tens-solar-mass black holes at the end of their evolution. The embedded
black holes will interact gravitationally with the massive accretion disc and
be dragged towards the central black hole. Merger of a disc-born black hole
with the central black hole will produce a burst of gravitational waves. If the
central black hole is accreting at a rate comparable to the Eddington limit,
the gas drag from the accretion disc will not alter significantly the dynamics
of the final year of merger, and the gravitational waves should be observable
by LISA. We argue that for a reasonable range of parameters such mergers will
be detected monthly, and that the gravitational-wave signal from these mergers
is distinct from that of other merger scenarios. Also, for some plausible black
hole masses and accretion rates, the burst of gravitational waves should be
accompanied by a detectable change in the optical luminosity of the central
engine.

consistent with the forward shock emission of an ultra-relativistic outflow,
which is suggested to be responsible for the initial hard spike of the giant

expanding into the interstellar medium could fit the observations. The possible

depletion factors (fraction of produced metals locked into dust grains) range
between 0.3 and 0.7. These conclusions depend very weakly on the mass of the
PISN stellar progenitor, which instead affects considerably the composition and
size distribution. For the assumed temperature evolution, grain condensation
starts 150-200 days after the explosion; the dominant compounds for all
progenitor masses are SiO2 and Mg2SiO4 while the contribution of amorphous
carbon and magnetite grains grows with progenitor mass; typical grain sizes

in the simulation we use two methods: the standard friends-of-friends (FOF)
method and the method, where the clusters are defined as maxima of a smoothed

using the smoothing radii $R_s=1.5h^{-1}$ Mpc and $R_s=1.0h^{-1}$ Mpc. The

is dominated by a quadratic term and by a cubic term in the inflaton field. We
also find that $\alpha_s>0$ is required for the quadratic model whereas
$\alpha_s<0 $ for the cubic model. Moreover, we have determined an upper bound
on the five-dimensional Planck scale, $M_5 \lsim 0.019$ M, for the quadratic
model. On the other hand, a running spectral index with $n_s>1$ on large scales
and $n_s<1$ on small scales is not possible in either case.

high eccentricity libration in a nonlinear secular resonance. The first two

computed with CLOUDY and then included into GRASIL, our spectrophotometric code

emission and population synthesis is based on a set of pre-computed HII region
emission models covering a wide range of physical quantities. Concerning the
extinction properties of normal star forming galaxies, we are able to interpret
the observed lack of correlation between the attenuation measured at Halpha and
in the UV band as a consequence of age selective extinction. We also find that,
for these galaxies with modest SFR, the ratio FIR/UV provides the best
constraints on the UV attenuation. Our model also allows to deal with different
SFR estimators in a consistent way, from the UV to radio wavelengths, and to
discuss the uncertainties arising from the different physical conditions
encountered in star forming galaxies. We provide our best estimates of
SFR/luminosity calibrations, together with their expected range of variation.
It results that SFR derived through Halpha, even when corrected for extinction
using the Balmer decrement, is affected by important uncertainties due to age
selective extinction. Another remarkable result is that SFR from UV luminosity
corrected by means of the ratio FIR/UV has a small uncertainty. Finally, our
model provides a calibration of SFR from radio luminosity; we are also able to
reproduce the observed FIR/radio ratio.

indistinguishable from pure CO ice. It is concluded, that in the majority of
the observed lines of sight, 60-90% of the CO is in a nearly pure form. In the
same model the 2143.7 cm-1 component can possibly be explained by the
longitudinal optical (LO) component of the vibrational transition in pure
crystalline CO ice which appears when the background source is linearly
polarised. Furthermore the absorption band from solid 13CO at 2092 cm-1 is
detected towards IRS 51 in the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex and an isotopic ratio

methods of studying the electronic structure of solids. By measuring the
kinetic energy and angular distribution of the electrons photoemitted from a
sample illuminated with sufficiently high-energy radiation, one can gain
information on both the energy and momentum of the electrons propagating inside
a material. This is of vital importance in elucidating the connection between
electronic, magnetic, and chemical structure of solids, in particular for those
complex systems which cannot be appropriately described within the
independent-particle picture. The last decade witnessed significant progress in
this technique and its applications, thus ushering in a new era in
photoelectron spectroscopy; today, ARPES experiments with 2 meV energy
resolution and 0.2 degree angular resolution are a reality even for
photoemission on solids. In this paper we will review the fundamentals of the
technique and present some illustrative experimental results; we will show how
ARPES can probe the momentum-dependent electronic structure of solids providing
detailed information on band dispersion and Fermi surface, as well as on the
strength and nature of those many-body correlations which may profoundly affect
the one-electron excitation spectrum and, in turn, determine the macroscopic

barriers for activated dynamics in supercooled liquids vanish as the
temperature of a viscous liquid approaches the dynamical transition temperature
from below. This occurs due to a decrease of the surface tension between local
meta-stable molecular arrangements much like at a spinodal. The dynamical
transition thus represents a crossover from the low $T$ activated bevavior to a
collisional transport regime at high $T$. This barrier softening explains the
deviation of the relaxation times, as a function of temperature, from the
simple $\log \tau \propto 1/s_c$ dependence at the high viscosity to a
mode-mode coupling dominated result at lower viscosity. By calculating the
barrier softening effects, the RFOT theory provides a {\em unified} microscopic
way to interpret structural relaxation data for many distinct classes of
structural glass formers over the measured temperature range. The theory also
provides an unambiguous procedure to determine the size of dynamically
cooperative regions in the presence of barrier renormalization effects using
the experimental temperature dependence of the relaxation times and the
configurational entropy data. We use the RFOT theory framework to discuss data

Evolution produces two distinct types of network. When a specific genotype is

non-interacting clusters in genotype space. When different types may influence
a large number of other sites, the network becomes one large interconnected
cluster. The distribution of interaction strengths -- but not the number of

abundance is only realistic for a high level of species connectivity. This
suggests that real ecosystems form one interconnected whole in which selection

approximations that are actually implemented do have coefficients that are
represented with a finite - and sometimes small - number of bits: this is due

  Motl and Neitzke, but our analysis fills several gaps left by their
discussion. We study the Reissner-Nordstrom results in some detail, and show
that, in contrast to the asymptotic QNMs of a Schwarzschild black hole, the
Reissner-Nordstrom QNMs are typically not periodic in the imaginary part of the
frequency. This leads to the charged black hole having peculiar properties
which complicate an interpretation of the results.

Minahan and Zarembo established that the restriction to scalar operators leads
to an integrable vector so(6) chain, while recent work in QCD suggested
restricting to twist operators, containing mostly covariant derivatives, yields
certain integrable Heisenberg XXX chains with non-compact spin symmetry sl(2).
Here we unify and generalize these insights and argue that the complete
one-loop planar dilatation generator of N=4 is described by an integrable
su(2,2|4) super spin chain. We also write down various forms of the associated
Bethe ansatz equations, whose solutions are in one-to-one correspondence with
the set of all one-loop planar anomalous dimensions in the N=4 gauge theory. We
finally speculate on the non-perturbative extension of these integrable
structures, which appears to involve non-local deformations of the conserved
charges.

linear order in the asymptotic expansion for unidirectional shallow water

entire {\it family} of shallow water wave equations that are asymptotically
equivalent to each other, under a group of nonlinear, nonlocal, normal-form
transformations introduced by Kodama in combination with the application of the
Helmholtz-operator. These Kodama-Helmholtz transformations are used to present
connections between shallow water waves, the integrable 5th-order Korteweg-de

contains an additional integrable case. The dispersion relation of the full

MeV/c (sigma) in the center-of-mass frame. The determination of the
four-momentum vectors of both outgoing protons allowed to derive the complete
kinematical information of the ppeta-system.
  An unexpectedly large enhancement of the occupation density in the
kinematical regions of low proton-eta relative momenta is observed. A
description taking the proton-proton and the eta-proton interaction into
account and assuming an on-shell incoherent pairwise interaction among the
produced particles fails to explain this strong effect. Its understanding will
require a rigorous three-body approach to the ppeta system and the precise
determination of contributions from higher partial waves.
  We also present an invariant mass spectrum of the proton-proton system
determined at Q = 4.5 MeV. Interestingly, the enhancement at large relative
momenta between protons is visible also at such a small excess energy.

that stable standing waves constructed from the zero-energy flows are confined

Vortex patterns awoken in the units by stimuli correspond to the memories of
the stimuli. This memory system is not a system for preserving memories as
usual but that for awaking memories. The system has interesting properties;
  (i) the absolute economy as for the energy consumption,

states. The question whether the correspondence is merely mathematical or can

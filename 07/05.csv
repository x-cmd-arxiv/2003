fitted to these data might be expected to become increasingly complex. Here we
present the Bayesian approach to the problem of cluster data modelling:
starting from simple, physically motivated parameterised functions to describe
the cluster's gas density, gravitational potential and temperature, we explore
the high-dimensional parameter spaces with a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo sampler,
and compute the Bayesian evidence in order to make probabilistic statements
about the models tested. In this way sufficiently good data will enable the
models to be distinguished, enhancing our astrophysical understanding; in any
case the models may be marginalised over in the correct way when estimating
global, perhaps cosmological, parameters. In this work we apply this
methodology to two sets of simulated interferometric Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
and gravitational weak lensing data, corresponding to current and
next-generation telescopes. We calculate the expected precision on the
measurement of the cluster gas fraction from such experiments, and investigate
the effect of the primordial CMB fluctuations on their accuracy. We find that
data from instruments such as AMI, when combined with wide-field ground-based
weak lensing data, should allow both cluster model selection and estimation of
gas fractions to a precision of better than 30 percent for a given cluster.

power spectrum and ISW effect. We adopt a phenomenological approach and
consider the mysterious dark energy to be a cosmic fluid. It is thus fully
characterized, up to linear order, by its equation of state and its speed of
sound. Whereas the equation of state has been widely studied in the literature,
less interest has been devoted to the speed of sound. Its observational
consequences come predominantly from very large scale modes of dark matter
perturbations (k < 0.01 h.Mpc^{-1}). Since these modes have hardly been probed
so far by large scale galaxy surveys, we investigate whether joint constraints
that can be placed on those two quantities using the recent CMB fluctuations
measurements by WMAP as well as the recently measured CMB large scale structure
cross-correlation. We find only a tentative 1$sigma$ detection of the speed of
sound, from CMB alone, c_{s}^{2}<0.04 at this low significance level.
Furthermore, the current uncertainties in bias in the matter power spectrum
preclude any constraints being placed using the cross correlation of CMB with
the NVSS radio survey. We believe however that improvements in bias through
improved survey scales and depths in the near future will improve hopes of
detecting the speed of sound.

and bolsters the ``starless'' interpretation of the core. The shorter baseline
BIMA data are compared to density models using a physically motivated
temperature distribution with a central minimum. This analysis provides clear
evidence for a turn-over from the steep outer density profile observed in dust
extinction to much more shallow behavior in the inner regions (<7500 AU). The
best fit Bonnor-Ebert, Plummer-like, broken power law, and end-on cylinder
models produce very similar flattened profiles and cannot be distinguished. We
quantify the sensitivity of the inferred structure to various uncertainties,
including the temperature distribution, the central position, and the presence
of a weak unresolved central component. The largest uncertainty comes from the
temperature assumption; an isothermal model modifies the best fit parameters by
\~2 sigma, with the inferred profiles more shallow. Dust emission and
extinction profiles are reproduced by an embedded cylinder with scale height
H=13.5'' inclined at a small angle to the line of sight. The flat central
density profile suggests that pressure forces still support the core, despite
the extended inward motions inferred from molecular line observations (Lee,

inward motions may represent the contraction of a prolate core along its major

cooperating nodes may find themselves unfairly loaded. Most previous efforts to
counter this behavior have relied on further cooperation between nodes to
exchange reputation information about other nodes. If a node observes another
node not participating correctly, it reports this observation to other nodes
who then take action to avoid being affected and potentially punish the bad

reputation information is subject to false accusations and requires maintaining
trust relationships with other nodes. The objective of OCEAN is to avoid this

amplitudes decrease monotonically as the momentum transfer increases; (2) the
decreasing is faster when going from quenched approximation to full QCD (with
decreasing quark masses) and this effect is associated with the increase of the
correlation lengths; (3) dynamical fermions generate two components in the
amplitude at small momentum transfer and the transition between them occurs at
momentum transfer near 1 GeV$^2$. We also obtain analytical parametrizations
for the elementary amplitudes, that are suitable for phenomenological uses, and
discuss the effects of extrapolations from the physical regions investigated in

get enhanced by hard loops. As a consequence their contribution to the pairing

very specific porous elastic material, described by a Cowin-Nunziato model. We
propose a method based upon a reducing of stress concentration problem for
cracks to some integral equations. By applying Fourier integral transforms the
problem is reduced to some integral equations. For the plane-strain problem we
operate with a direct numerical treatment of a hypersingular integral equation.
In the axially symmetric case, for the penny-shaped crack, the problem is
reduced to a regular Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. In the both
cases we study stress-concentration factor, and investigate its behavior versus
porosity of the material. More in particular the stress concentration factor in
the medium with voids is always higher, under the same conditions, than in the
classical elastic medium made of material of the skeleton. Further, as can be
seen, the influence of the porosity becomes more significant for larger cracks;
that is also quite natural from a physical point of view.

equations of motion in the McLerran-Venugopalan model for gluon production in
central heavy ion collisions leads to a suppresion at low $p_t$ and an
enhancement at the intermediate $p_t$ region as compared to peripheral heavy
ion and pp collisions at the same energy. Our results are compared to previous,
Color Glass Condensate inspired calculations of gluon production in heavy ion
collisions. We revisit the predictions of the Color Glass Condensate model for
$pA$ ($dA$) collisions in Leading Order and show that quantum evolution--in
particular the phenomenon of geometric scaling and change of anomalous
dimensions--preserves the Cronin enhancement of $pA$ cross section (when
normalized to the leading twist term) in the Leading Order approximation even
though the $p_t$ spectrum can change. We comment on the case when gluon
radiation is included.

accelerator structure due to dispersive effects. This distortion together with
beam loading introduce energy spread between 192 bunches. In order to minimize
this energy spread we modify the input RF pulse shape. The pulse propagation,
energy gain, and beam loading are modelled with a mode-matching computer code
and a circuit model. A 2D model and a circuit model of a complete 60 cm
structure, consisting of 55 cells and input and output couplers is analyzed.
This structure operates with a 5pi/6 phase advance per cell. Dispersive effects
for this structure are more significant than for previously studied 2pi/3 phase
advance accelerating structures. Experimental results are compared with the
theoretical model and excellent agreement is obtained for the propagation of an
RF pulse through the structure.

biaxially anisotropic left-handed materials are investigated in this paper. We
show that in the biaxially gyrotropic left-handed material, the left-right
coupling of circularly polarized light arises due to the negative indices in
permittivity and permeability tensors of gyrotropic media. It is well known
that the geometric phases of photons inside a curved fiber in previous
experiments often depend on the cone angles of solid angles subtended by a
curve traced by the direction of wave vector of light, at the center of photon
momentum space. Here, however, for the light propagating inside certain
anisotropic left-handed media we will present a different geometric phase that
is independent of the cone angles. The extra phases of electromagnetic wave
resulting from the instantaneous helicity inversion at the interfaces between
left- and right- handed (LRH) media is also studied in detail by using the
Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory. Some interesting applications (e.g.,
controllable position-dependent frequency shift, detection of quantum-vacuum
geometric phases and helicity reversals at the LRH interfaces etc.) of above
effects and phenomena in left-handed media is briefly discussed.

distributions. Also, it is argued and demonstrated numerically that particle
trajectory stability is largely controlled by the background flow: trajectory
instability, quantified by various measures of the ``degree of chaos,''
increases on average with increasing $|\mathrm{d}\omega/\mathrm{d}I|$, where
$\omega (I)$ is the angular frequency of the trajectory in the background flow
and $I$ is the action.

support to an interesting physical model recently proposed in the literature,

Also, the results obtained suggest a more general validity of this intuitive
model, for example when external boundaries or thermal fields are present.

them to migrate and thus affect their final orbital periods. We suggest that
the connection between planets and disks may be deeper and involve a symbiotic
evolution. By contributing to the outward transport of angular momentum,
planets promote disk accretion. Here we demonstrate that planets sufficiently
massive to open gaps could be the primary agents driving disk accretion. Those
having masses below the gap opening threshold drift inward more rapidly than
the disk material and can only play a minor role in its accretion. Eccentricity
growth during gap formation may involve an even more intimate symbiosis. Given
a small initial eccentricity, just a fraction of a percent, the orbital
eccentricity of a massive planet may grow rapidly once a mass in excess of the
planet's mass has been repelled to form a gap around the planet's orbit. Then,
as the planet's radial excursions approach the gap's width, subsequent
eccentricity growth slows so that the planet's orbit continues to be confined
within the gap.

supernovae including pair--instability supernovae, applying a theory of non--

evolution of gas temperature in theejecta, which strongly affects the number
density and size of newly formed grains, is calculated by solving the radiative
transfer equation taking account of the energy deposition of radio active
elements. Two extreme cases are considered for the mixing of elements in the
ejecta; unmixed and uniformly mixed cases within the He--core.
  The results of calculations are summarized as the followings; in the unmixed
ejecta, a variety of grain species condense, reflecting the difference of the
elemental composition at the formation site in the ejecta, otherwise only oxide
grains condense in the uniformly mixed ejecta. The average size of newly formed
grains spans the range of three orders of magnitude, depending on the grain
species and the formation condition, and the maximum radius is limited to less
than 1 $\mu$m, which does not depend on the progenitor mass. The size
distribution function summed up over all grain species is approximated by a
power--law formula whose index is -3.5 for the larger radius and -2.5 for the
smaller one; the radius at the crossover point ranges from 0.004 to 0.1 $\mu$m,
depending on the model of supernovae. The fraction of mass locked into dust
grains increases with increasing the progenitor mass; 2--5 % of the progenitor
mass for core collapse supernovae and 15--30 % for pair--instability supernovae
whose progenitor mass ranges from 140 to 260 $M_{\odot}$. Thus, if the very
massive stars populate the first generation stars, a large amount of dust
grains would be produced in the early universe.

relatively sophisticated search mechanism in the proposed 'SP' system appears
to open the door to the integration and simplification of a range of functions

space manifests itself in the eigenvalue distribution of a single matrix. The
precise manner of the manifestation is described. The set of all eigenvalues
can be decomposed into subsets whose members increase smoothly, provided that
the fundamental approximations in matrix regularization hold well. Those
subsets are termed as eigenvalue sequences. The eigenvalue sequences exhibit a
branching phenomenon which reflects Morse-theoretic information of topology.
  Furthermore, exploiting the notion of eigenvalue sequences, a new
correspondence rule between matrices and functions is constructed. The new rule
identifies the matrix elements directly with Fourier components of the
corresponding function, evaluated along certain orbits. The rule has
semi-locality in the base space, so that it can be used for all membrane
topologies in a unified way. A few numerical examples are studied, and
consistency with previously known correspondence rules is discussed.

whose existence is expected when the fundamental interaction between quarks is
strong or superstrong Coulombic type. The relation between the type of the
extra singularity at t=0 of the scattering amplitude and the power of the
asymptotic behavior of the long range potential is derived. The square root
cusp in the once subtracted S-wave amplitude, whose existence is expected when
the Van der Waals force of the London type is acting, is observed when we
analyze the high precision phase shift data of the low energy proton-proton
scattering.

  Monastero, June 9--13, 2003",,,,"nucl-th",,"  A new version of the method of Continuum-Discretized Coupled-Channels method
(CDCC) is proposed, that is, the Eikonal-CDCC method (E-CDCC). The E-CDCC
equation, for Coulomb dissociation in particular, can easily and safely be
solved, since it is a first-order differential equation and contains no huge
angular momentum in contrast to the CDCC one. The scattering amplitude
calculated by E-CDCC has a similar form to that by CDCC. Then one can construct
hybrid amplitude in an intuitive way, i.e., CDCC amplitude is adopted for a
smaller angular momentum $L$ and E-CDCC one for a larger $L$ related to an
impact parameter $b$. The hybrid calculation is found to perfectly reproduce
the quantum mechanical result for $^{58}$Ni($^8$B,$^7$Be$+p$)$^{58}$Ni at 240
MeV, which shows its applicability to systematic analysis of $^8$B dissociation
to extract the astrophysical factor $S_{17}$ with high accuracy.

states is reviewed, with emphasize on the detection operators necessary for
performing the measurement. An analytical result is derived for the minimum
probability of errors in deciding whether the state of a quantum system is
either a given pure state or a uniform statistical mixture of any number of
mutually orthogonal states. The result is applied to two-qubit states, and the
minimum error probabilities achievable by collective and local measurements on
the qubits are compared.

quantum physics are handled through master equations for the density matrix.
Master equations such as the Lindblad equation preserve the trace of this
matrix. Viewing them as first-order time-dependent operator equations for the
elements of the density matrix, a unitary integration procedure can be adapted
to solve for these matrix elements. A simple model for decoherence preserves
the hermiticity of the density matrix. A single, classical Riccati equation is
the only one requiring numerical handling to obtain a full solution of the
quantum evolution. The procedure is general, valid for any number of levels,
but is illustrated here for a three-level system with two driving fields. For
various choices of the initial state, we study the evolution of the system as a
function of the amplitudes, relative frequencies and phases of the driven
fields, and of the strength of the decoherence. The monotonic growth of the
entropy is followed as the system evolves from a pure to a mixed state. An
example is provided by the $n=3$ states of the hydrogen atom in a
time-dependent electric field, such degenerate manifolds affording an
analytical solution.

packets in the infinite square well. In addition to emphasizing the appearance
of wave packet revivals, i.e., situations where a spreading wave packet reforms
with close to its initial shape and width, we also examine in detail the
approach to the collapsed phase where the position-space probability density is
almost uniformly spread over the well. We focus on visualizing these phenomena
in both position- and momentum-space as well as by following the time-dependent
expectation values of and uncertainties in position and momentum. We discuss
the time scales for wave packet collapse, using both an autocorrelation
function analysis, as well as focusing on expectation values and find two
relevant time scales which describe different aspects of the decay phase. In an
Appendix, we briefly discuss wave packet revival and collapse in a more
general, one-dimensional power-law potential given by $V_{(k)}(x) = V_0|x/a|^k$
which interpolates between the case of the harmonic oscillator ($k=2$) and the
infinite well ($k=\infty$).

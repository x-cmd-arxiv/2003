primordial density perturbations that does not rely on inflation. In our
scenario, a perfect fluid dominates the early stages of an expanding,
non-inflating universe. Because the speed of sound of the fluid decays,
perturbations are left frozen behind the sound horizon, with a spectral index
that depends on the fluid equation of state. We explore here a toy model that
realizes this idea. Although the model can explain an adiabatic, Gaussian,
scale invariant spectrum of primordial perturbations, it turns out that in its
simplest form it cannot account for the observed amplitude of the primordial
density perturbations.

counts of faint point sources in astronomical images, i.e. counts of sources
whose flux falls below the detection limit of a survey. The approach is based
on the theory of alpha-stable distributions. We show that the non-Gaussian
distribution of the intensity fluctuations produced by a generic point source
population -- whose number counts follow a simple power law -- belongs to the
alpha-stable family of distributions. Even if source counts do not follow a
simple power law, we show that the alpha-stable model is still useful in many
astrophysical scenarios. With the alpha-stable model it is possible to totally
describe the non-Gaussian distribution with a few parameters which are closely
related to the parameters describing the source counts, instead of an infinite
number of moments. Using statistical tools available in the signal processing
literature, we show how to estimate these parameters in an easy and fast way.
We demonstrate that the model proves valid when applied to realistic point
source number counts at microwave frequencies. In the case of point
extragalactic sources observed at CMB frecuencies, our technique is able to
successfully fitting the P(D) distribution of deflections and to precisely
determining the main parameters which describe the number counts. In the case
of the Planck mission, the relative errors on these parameters are small either
at low and at high frequencies. We provide a way to deal with the presence of
Gaussian noise in the data using the empirical characteristic function of the
P(D). The formalism and methods here presented can be very useful also for
experiments in other frequency ranges, e.g. X-ray or radio Astronomy.

the network at $t=1$ is independent of the symmetry of the additional random

theories which use the results at $t=1$ to estimate quantities relevant to the
retrieval performance of the network. The symmetry of the synaptic interaction
matrix becomes effective from the second time step, explicitly through a
correlation function involving spin configurations at different times. This
suggests that the prediction of the long time behavior of the network from the
first few time steps may not be {\it always} correct. This was confirmed by the
numerical simulation which shows that the difference in the long time and the
short time behavior of the network becomes pronounced in presence of asymmetry
in the synaptic interaction matrix. It is also found in simulations that the
size of the basins of attraction of the stored patterns decreases with an
increase in the asymmetry. Moreover, the convergence time for the retrieval
increases. These results are contrary to the expectations from the earlier
studies based on the counting of fixed points. However, the convergence time
for the spurious fixed points increases faster than that for the retrieval
fixed points in the presence of asymmetry in the synapses. This is a positive
feature of the asymmetry so far as the retrieval performance of the network is
concerned.

  Information Compression by Multiple Alignment, Unification and Search",,"Journal of Universal Computer Science 6(8), 781--829, 2000",,,"cs.AI cs.CL",,"  This article introduces the idea that ""information compression by multiple
alignment, unification and search"" (ICMAUS) provides a framework within which
natural language syntax may be represented in a simple format and the parsing
and production of natural language may be performed in a transparent manner.
  The ICMAUS concepts are embodied in a software model, SP61. The organisation
and operation of the model are described and a simple example is presented
showing how the model can achieve parsing of natural language.
  Notwithstanding the apparent paradox of 'decompression by compression', the
ICMAUS framework, without any modification, can produce a sentence by decoding
a compressed code for the sentence. This is illustrated with output from the
SP61 model.
  The article includes four other examples - one of the parsing of a sentence
in French and three from the domain of English auxiliary verbs. These examples
show how the ICMAUS framework and the SP61 model can accommodate 'context
sensitive' features of syntax in a relatively simple and direct manner.

their limiting values. In this way, we obtain the picture of a cyclic universe.
By estimating the entropy gained in each big crunch and big bang, we reach the
conclusion that our universe has repeated this process about forty times after
it was created at the Planck scale. We also show that the model gives a
scale-invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations.

  The validity of the density description is confirmed by comparisons of

collisions have two competing roles: a dispersing-like effect and a clustering

that grains with lower inertia are more clusterized.

worlds. The most famous element is the measurement problem, i.e., the
measurement of a quantum system by a classical apparatus, and the concomitant
phenomena of wave packet reduction, the appearance of probability, and the
problems related to Schr\""odinger cat states. A fundamental question in this
context is whether quantum mechanics can bootstrap itself to the classical
world: is quantum mechanics self-consistent, such that the measurement process
can be understood within quantum mechanics itself, or does this process require
additional elements from the realm outside of traditional quantum mechanics?
Here, we point to a problematic aspect in the traditional Schr\""odinger cat
argument which can be overcome through its extension with a proper macroscopic
preparation device; the deliberate creation of a cat state and its
identification then turns into a non-trivial problem requiring the
determination of the evolution of a quantum system entangled with a macroscopic
reservoir. We describe a new type of wave-function correlator testing for the
appearance of Schr\""odinger cat states and discuss its implications for
theories deriving the wave function collapse from a unitary evolution.

dissipative process of spontaneous emission. It is shown that spontaneous
emission can lead to a transient entanglement between the atoms even if the
atoms were prepared initially in an unentangled state. The amount of
entanglement created in the system is quantified by using two different
measures: concurrence and negativity. We find analytical formulas for the
evolution of concurrence and negativity in the system. We also find the
analytical relation between the two measures of entanglement. The system
consists of two two-level atoms which are separated by an arbitrary distance
$r_{12}$ and interact with each other via the dipole-dipole interaction, and
the antisymmetric state of the system is included throughout, even for small
inter-atomic separations, in contrast to the small sample model. It is shown
that for sufficiently large values of the dipole-dipole interaction initially
the entanglement exhibits oscillatory behaviour with considerable entanglement
in the peaks. For longer times the amount of entanglement is directly related
to the population of the slowly decaying antisymmetric state.

In the final part, we propose an experimental scheme to measure these

Ising-type models. We analyze in particular the time evolution of initial Bell
states created in a fully polarized background and on the ground state. We find
that the pairwise entanglement propagates with a velocity proportional to the
reduced interaction for all the four Bell states. Singlet-like states are
favored during the propagation, in the sense that triplet-like states change
their character during the propagation under certain circumstances.
Characteristic for the anisotropic models is the instantaneous creation of
pairwise entanglement from a fully polarized state; furthermore, the
propagation of pairwise entanglement is suppressed in favor of a creation of
different types of entanglement. The ``entanglement wave'' evolving from a Bell
state on the ground state turns out to be very localized in space-time. Further
support to a recently formulated conjecture on entanglement sharing is given.

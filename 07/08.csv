have used a simplified model of the disk vertical structure that allows us to
quickly bring out effects related to the disk self-gravity. We find that the
often studied optical and near-infrared line profiles are produced too close to
the central object to provide significant evidence for non-Keplerian rotation.
Based on parameters relevant for the case of FU Ori, we show that
high-resolution long-wavelength spectroscopy, of the far-infrared H$_2$ pure
rotational lines (sometimes observed in ``passive'' protostellar disks) and
sub-mm CO lines, should be well suited to probe the rotation curve in the outer

twin kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs). Competing models for the

early-type galaxies are associated with globular clusters (GCs). Here, we
discuss the correlations between LMXBs and GCs in a sample of four early-type
galaxies. There is some evidence that the fraction of LMXBs associated with GCs
(f_X-GC) increases along the Hubble sequence from spiral bulges to S0s to Es to
cDs. On the other hand, the fraction of globular clusters which contain X-ray
sources appears to be roughly constant at f_GC-X ~ 4%. There is a strong
tendency for the X-ray sources to be associated with the optically more
luminous GCs. However, this correlation is consistent with a constant
probability of finding a LMXB per unit optical luminosity; it seems to result
primarily from the larger number of stars in optically luminous GCs. The
probability of finding a bright LMXB per unit optical luminosity in the GCs is
about 1.5e-7 LMXBs per L_solar,I for L_X >~ 1e38 erg/s, and rises to about
2.0e-7 LMXBs per L_solar,I at lower X-ray luminosities, L_X >~ 3e37 erg/s. This
frequency appears to be roughly constant for different galaxies, including the
bulges of the Milky Way and M31. There is a tendency for the X-ray sources to
be found preferentially in redder GCs. This seems to indicate that the
evolution of X-ray binaries in a GC is affected either by the metallicity or
age of the GC, with younger and/or more metal rich GCs having more LMXBs. There
is a weak tendency for the brightest LMXBs, whose luminosities exceed the
Eddington luminosity for a 1.4 M_solar neutron star, to avoid GCs. That may
indicate that black hole X-ray are somewhat less likely to be found in GCs, as
seems to be true in our Galaxy.

suggested that the enrichment might originate in the resonant interaction
between large-scale shear flows in the accreted H/He envelope and gravity waves
at the interface between the envelope and the underlying C/O white dwarf. The
shear flow amplifies the waves, which eventually form cusps and break. This
wave breaking injects a spray of C/O into the superincumbent H/He. Using
two-dimensional simulations, we formulate a quantitative expression for the
amount of C/O per unit area that can be entrained into the H/He at saturation.
The fraction of the envelope that is enriched depends on the horizontal
distribution of shear velocity and the density contrast between the C/O white
dwarf and the H/He layer but is roughly independent of the vertical shape of
the shear profile. Using this parameterization for the mixed mass, we then
perform several one-dimensional Lagrangian calculations of an accreting white
dwarf envelope and consider two scenarios: that the wave breaking and mixing is
driven by the convective flows; and that the mixing occurs prior to the onset
of convection. In the absence of enrichment prior to ignition, the base of the
convective zone, as calculated from mixing-length theory with the Ledoux
instability criterion, does not reach the C/O interface. As a result, there is
no additional mixing, and the runaway is slow. In contrast, the formation of a
mixed layer during the accretion of H/He, prior to ignition, causes a more
violent runaway. The envelope can be enriched by <25% of C/O by mass
(consistent with that observed in some ejecta) for shear velocities, over the
surface, with Mach numbers <0.4.

environments can dominate evolutionary processes in galaxies and affect cosmic
structure in the Universe. Only the Local Group offers the spatial resolution
to quantitatively study feedback processes on a variety of scales. Lyman
continuum radiation from hot, luminous stars ionizes HII regions and is
believed to dominate production of the warm component of the interstellar
medium (ISM). Some of this radiation apparently escapes from galaxies into the
intergalactic environment. Supernovae and strong stellar winds generate shell
structures such as supernova remnants, stellar wind bubbles, and superbubbles
around OB associations. Hot (10^6 K) gas is generated within these shells, and
is believed to be the origin of the hot component of the ISM. Superbubble
activity thus is likely to dominate the ISM structure, kinematics, and phase
balance in star-forming galaxies. Galactic superwinds in starburst galaxies
enable the escape of mass, ionizing radiation, and heavy elements. Although
many important issues remain to be resolved, there is little doubt that
feedback processes plays a fundamental role in energy cycles on scales ranging
from individual stars to cosmic structure. This contribution reviews studies of
radiative and mechanical feedback in the Local Group.

there is a unique tensor ${\bf T}$ quadratic in the magnetic flux density $\vec

the macroscopic field does indeed exert a torque on each of the microscopic
dipoles, so this state is only possible if there are material stresses which
keep the dipoles aligned with each other and misaligned with the macroscopic

was significantly reionized at redshifts as high as z~17. At this early epoch,
the first ionizing sources likely appeared in the shallow potential wells of
mini-halos with virial temperatures T < 10^4 K. Once such an ionizing source
turns off, its surrounding HII region Compton cools and recombines.
Nonetheless, we show that the ``fossil'' HII regions left behind remain at high
adiabats, prohibiting gas accretion and cooling in subsequent generations of
mini-halos. Thus, early star formation is self-limiting. We quantify this
effect to show that star formation in mini-halos cannot account for the bulk of
the electron scattering opacity measured by WMAP, which must be due to more
massive objects. We argue that gas entropy, rather than IGM metallicity,
regulates the evolution of the global ionizing emissivity, and impedes full
reionization until lower redshifts. We discuss several important consequences
of this early entropy floor for reionization. It reduces gas clumping,
curtailing the required photon budget for reionization. An entropy floor also
prevents H2 formation and cooling, due to reduced gas densities: it greatly
enhances feedback from UV photodissociation of H2. An early X-ray background
would also furnish an entropy floor to the entire IGM; thus, X-rays impede
rather than enhance H2 formation. Future 21cm observations may probe the
topology of fossil HII regions.

determinations. Low-redshift SNe Ia (z <~ 0.1) demonstrate that the Hubble
expansion is linear, that H_0 = 65 +/- 2 (statistical) km/s/Mpc, and that the
properties of dust in other galaxies are similar to those of dust in the Milky
Way. The light curves of high-redshift (z = 0.3 - 1) SNe Ia are stretched in a
manner consistent with the expansion of space; similarly, their spectra exhibit
slower temporal evolution (by a factor of 1 + z) than those of nearby SNe Ia.
The measured luminosity distances of SNe Ia as a function of redshift have
shown that the expansion of the Universe is currently accelerating, probably
due to the presence of repulsive dark energy such as Einstein's cosmological
constant (\Lambda). Combining our data with existing measurements of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) radiation and with the results of large-scale
structure surveys, we find a best fit for \Omega_m and \Omega_\Lambda of about
0.3 and 0.7, respectively. Other studies (e.g., masses of clusters of galaxies)
also suggest that \Omega_m \approx 0.3. The sum of the densities, ~1.0, agrees
with the value predicted by most inflationary models for the early Universe:
the Universe is flat on large scales. A number of possible systematic effects
(dust, supernova evolution) thus far do not seem to eliminate the need for
\Omega_\Lambda > 0. Most recently, analyses of SNe Ia at z = 1.0 - 1.7 provide
further support for current acceleration, and give tentative evidence for an
early epoch of deceleration. Current projects include the search for additional
SNe Ia at z > 1 to confirm the early deceleration, and the measurement of a few
hundred SNeIa at z = 0.2 - 0.8 to determine the equation of state of the dark
energy, w = P/(\rho c^2).

that scaling relations similar to those observed for galaxy clusters are
already defined by their dark matter hosts. The slopes however are not the
same, and among the various possibilities in principle able to bring the
simulated and the observed scaling relations in mutual agreement, we show that
the preferred solution is a luminosity dependent mass-to-light ratio (M/L ~
L^0.3), that well corresponds to what inferred observationally. We then show
that at galactic scales there is a conflict between the cosmological
predictions of structure formation, the observed trend of the mass-to-light
ratio in ellipticals, and the slope of their luminosity-velocity dispersion
relation (that significantly differs from the analogous one followed by
clusters). The conclusion is that the scaling laws of elliptical galaxies might
be the combined result of the cosmological collapse of density fluctuations at
the epoch when galactic scales became non-linear, plus important modifications
afterward due to early-time dissipative merging. Finally, we briefly discuss
the possible evolution of the cluster scaling relations with redshift.

source of 1.5 10^40 erg s^-1 in the 2-10 keV band, surrounded by hot gas at a
temperature of \sim 0.6 keV. The bolometric nuclear luminosity is at least \sim
200 times lower than expected if mass accreted on the supermassive black hole,
that HST shows to reside at the center of this galaxy, at the rate predicted by
the spherical and adiabatic Bondi accretion theory and with the high radiative
efficiency of a standard accretion disc. The low luminosity, coupled to the
observed absence of Fe-K emission in the nuclear spectrum, indicates that such
a disc is not present. This nucleus differs from bright unobscured AGNs also
for the lack of high flux variability and of prominent broad Halpha emission.
However, it is also too faint for the predictions of simple radiatively
inefficient accretion taking place at the Bondi rate; it could be too radio
bright, instead, for radiatively inefficient accretion that includes strong
mass outflows or convection. This discrepancy could be solved by the possible
presence of nuclear radio jets. An alternative explanation of the low
luminosity, in place of radiative inefficiency, could be unsteady accretion.

alpha emission line comprises 2 or more components and implies that very weak
mass transfer is occurring. The dynamical solution also implies that the dMe
star just fills its Roche lobe. Accurate masses and radii for each star were
derived: the dMe values favour the Clemens et al. (1998) mass-radius relation.
The large rotational velocity of the white dwarf (400 km/s) suggests that the
system has transferred mass in the past so that it is presently a hibernating

provides an opportunity for tests of diffusion theory.

are currently attracting much experimental and theoretical interest. Rare-earth
ions generally have small exchange interactions and large magnetic moments.
This makes it necessary to understand in detail the role of long-range magnetic
dipole-dipole interactions in these systems, in particular in the context of
spin-spin correlations that develop in the paramagnetic phase, but are often
unable to condense into a conventional long-range magnetic ordered phase. This
scenario is most dramatically emphasized in the frustrated pyrochlore
antiferromagnet material Tb2Ti207 which does not order down to 50 mK despite an
antiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss temperature Tcw ~ -20 K. In this paper we report
results from mean-field theory calculations of the paramagnetic elastic
neutron-scattering in highly frustrated magnetic systems with long-range
dipole-dipole interactions, focusing on the Tb2Ti207 system. Modeling Tb2Ti207
as an antiferromagnetic <111> Ising pyrochlore, we find that the mean-field
paramagnetic scattering is inconsistent with the experimentally observed
results. Through simple symmetry arguments we demonstrate that the observed
paramagnetic correlations in Tb2Ti207 are precluded from being generated by any
spin Hamiltonian that considers only Ising spins, but are qualitatively
consistent with Heisenberg-like moments. Explicit calculations of the
paramagnetic scattering pattern for both <111> Ising and Heisenberg models,
which include finite single-ion anisotropy, support these claims. We offer
suggestions for reconciling the need to restore spin isotropy with the Ising
like structure suggested by the single-ion properties of Tb3+.

can do things more efficiently. However, motivating the agents to abide to a
solution requires careful analysis: only some of the solutions are stable in
the sense that no group of agents is motivated to break off and form a new
coalition. This constraint has been studied extensively in cooperative game
theory. However, the computational questions around this constraint have
received less attention. When it comes to coalition formation among software
agents (that represent real-world parties), these questions become increasingly
explicit.

idea of conformal transformations with infinity represented by the conformal
boundary of space-time. Generalizing examples such as flat and Schwarzschild
space-times, it is proposed that the Penrose conformal factor be a product of
advanced and retarded conformal factors, which asymptotically relate physical
and conformal null (light-like) coordinates and vanish at future and past null
infinity respectively, with both vanishing at spatial infinity. A
correspondingly refined definition of asymptotic flatness at both spatial and
null infinity is given, including that the conformal boundary is locally a
light cone, with spatial infinity as the vertex. It is shown how to choose the
conformal factors so that this asymptotic light cone is locally a metric light
cone. The theory is implemented in the spin-coefficient (or null-tetrad)
formalism by a simple joint transformation of the spin-metric and spin-basis
(or metric and tetrad). The advanced and retarded conformal factors may be used
as expansion parameters near the respective null infinity, together with a
dependent expansion parameter for both spatial and null infinity, essentially
inverse radius. Asymptotic regularity conditions on the spin-coefficients are
proposed, based on the conformal boundary locally being a smoothly embedded
metric light cone. These conditions ensure that the Bondi-Sachs energy-flux
integrals of ingoing and outgoing gravitational radiation decay at spatial
infinity such that the total radiated energy is finite, and that the
Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum has a unique limit at spatial infinity, coinciding
with the uniquely rendered ADM energy-momentum.

muons is good enough to allow for their detection, if the mass splitting is

violation in B and in K systems is reviewed. Lattice has provided useful input
which, in conjunction with experimenatl data, leads to the conclusion that
CP-odd phase in the CKM matrix plays the dominant role in the observed
asymmetry in $B \to \psi K_s$. It is now quite likely that any beyond the SM,
CP-odd, phase will cause only small deviations in B-physics. Search for the
effects of the new phase(s) will consequently require very large data samples
as well as very precise theoretical predictions. Clean determination of {\it
all} the angles of the unitarity triangle therefore becomes essential. In this
regard $B \to K D^0$ processes play a unique role. Regarding K-decays,
remarkable progress made by theory with regard to maintenance of chiral
symmetry on the lattice is briefly discussed. First application already provide
quantitaive information on $B_K$ and the $\Delta I=1/2$ rule. The enhancement
in $Re A_0$ appears to arise solely from tree operators, esp. $Q_2$; penguin
contribution to $Re A_0$ appears to be very small. However, improved
calculations are necessary for $\epsilon^'/epsilon$ as there the contributions
of QCD penguins and electroweak penguins largely seem to cancel. There are good
reasons, though, to believe that these cancellations will not survive
improvements that are now underway. Importance of determining the unitarity
triangle purely from K-decays is also emphasized.

renormalization group parameter with the interpretation of an inverse of the
spatial size of the color charge distribution in the effective quarks and
gluons. The eigenvalue equation for H_lambda couples quark-anti-quark states
with sectors of a larger number of constituents. The coupling to states with
more than one effective gluon, and interactions in the quark-anti-quark-gluon
sector, are removed at the price of introducing an ansatz for the gluon mass,
mu^2. The simplified equation is used to evaluate a new Hamiltonian of order
alpha_lambda that acts only in the effective quark-anti-quark sector and in the

orrections and spin-independent harmonic oscillator term with frequency omega =

originates from the hole excavated in the overlapping quark self-interaction
gluon clouds by the exchange of effective gluons between the quarks. The new

bundle $G \to Q=G/H$, $H$ being a Lie subgroup. In contrast to generic
Chaplygin systems, the reductions of our LR systems onto the homogeneous space
$Q$ always possess an invariant measure.
  We study the case $G=SO(n)$, when LR systems are multidimensional
generalizations of the Veselova problem of a nonholonomic rigid body motion,
which admit a reduction to systems with an invariant measure on the (co)tangent
bundle of Stiefel varieties $V(k,n)$ as the corresponding homogeneous spaces.
  For $k=1$ and a special choice of the left-invariant metric on SO(n), we
prove that under a change of time, the reduced system becomes an integrable
Hamiltonian system describing a geodesic flow on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$.
This provides a first example of a nonholonomic system with more than two
degrees of freedom for which the celebrated Chaplygin reducibility theorem is
applicable. In this case we also explicitly reconstruct the motion on the group
SO(n).

masses travel on a eight shaped planar curve; this orbit is obtained minimizing
the action integral on the set of simple planar choreographies with some
special symmetry constraints. In this work our aim is to study the problem of
$n$ masses moving in $\RR^d$ under an attractive force generated by a potential
of the kind $1/r^\alpha$, $\alpha >0$, with the only constraint to be a simple
choreography: if $q_1(t),...,q_n(t)$ are the $n$ orbits then we impose the
existence of $x \in H^1_{2 \pi}(\RR,\RR^d)$ such that $q_i(t)=x(t+(i-1) \tau),

prove that for every $d,n \in \NN$ and $\alpha>0$, the lagrangian action
attains its absolute minimum on the planar circle. Next we deal with the
problem in a rotating frame and we show a reacher phenomenology: indeed while
for some values of the angular velocity minimizers are still circles, for
others the minima of the action are not anymore rigid motions.

  using variations on familiar one-dimensional potentials","19 pages, 5 figures","Eur. J. Phys. 23 (2002) 165",,,"quant-ph",,"  After briefly reviewing the definitions of classical probability densities
for position, $P_{CL}(x)$, and for momentum, $P_{CL}(p)$, we present several
examples of classical mechanical potential systems, mostly variations on such
familiar cases as the infinite well and the uniformly accelerated particle for
which the classical distributions can be easily derived and visualized. We
focus especially on a simple potential which interpolates between the symmetric
linear potential, $V(x) = F|x|$, and the infinite well, which can illustrate,
in a mathematically straightforward way, how the divergent, $\delta$-function
classical probability density for momentum for the infinite well can be easily
seen to arise. Such examples can help students understand the quantum
mechanical momentum-space wavefunction (and its corresponding probability
density) in much the same way that other semi-classical techniques, such as the
WKB approximation, can be used to visualize position-space wavefunctions.

states that any position measurement with noise epsilon brings the momentum
disturbance not less than hbar/2epsilon. This relation holds only for
restricted class of measuring apparatuses. Here, Heisenberg's uncertainty
relation is generalized to a relation that holds for all the possible quantum
measurements, from which conditions are obtained for measuring apparatuses to
satisfy Heisenberg's relation. In particular, every apparatus with the noise
and the disturbance statistically independent from the measured object is
proven to satisfy Heisenberg's relation. For this purpose, all the possible
quantum measurements are characterized by naturally acceptable axioms. Then, a
mathematical notion of the distance between probability operator valued
measures and observables is introduced and the basic properties are explored.
Based on this notion, the measurement noise and disturbance are naturally
defined for any quantum measurements in a model independent formulation. Under
this formulation, various uncertainty relations are also derived for
apparatuses with independent noise, independent disturbance, unbiased noise,
and unbiased disturbance as well as noiseless apparatuses and nondisturbing
apparatuses. Two models of position measurements are discussed to show that
Heisenberg's relation can be violated even by approximately repeatable position
measurements.

mechanics of Klein-Gordon fields that is based on the construction of a Hilbert
space with a relativistically invariant, positive-definite, and conserved inner
product. In particular we offer a natural construction of a position operator
and the corresponding localized and coherent states. The restriction of this
position operator to the positive-frequency fields coincides with the
Newton-Wigner operator. Our approach does not rely on the conventional
restriction to positive-frequency fields. Yet it provides a consistent quantum
mechanical description of Klein-Gordon fields with a genuine probabilistic
interpretation.

decoherent and incoherent. Unitary errors are systematic, and result in a
density matrix that differs from the desired one by a unitary operation.
Decoherent errors correspond to general completely positive superoperators, and
can only be corrected using methods such as quantum error correction.
Incoherent errors can also be described, on average, by completely positive
superoperators, but can nevertheless be corrected by the application of a
locally unitary operation that ``refocuses'' them. They are due to reproducible
spatial or temporal variations in the system's Hamiltonian, so that information
on the variations is encoded in the system's spatiotemporal state and can be
used to correct them. In this paper liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) is used to demonstrate that such refocusing effects can be built directly
into the control fields, where the incoherence arises from spatial
inhomogeneities in the quantizing static magnetic field as well as the
radio-frequency control fields themselves. Using perturbation theory, it is
further shown that the eigenvalue spectrum of the completely positive
superoperator exhibits a characteristic spread that contains information on the
Hamiltonians' underlying distribution.

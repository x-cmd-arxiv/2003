recently discovered quadruple QSO and gravitational lens HE0435-1223. Using the
Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrophotometer (PMAS), we show that all four QSO
components have very similar but not identical spectra. In particular, the
spectral slopes of components A, B, and D are indistinguishable, implying that
extinction due to dust plays no major role in the lensing galaxy. While also
the emission line profiles are identical within the error bars, as expected
from lensing, the equivalent widths show significant differences between
components. Most likely, microlensing is responsible for this phenomenon. This
is also consistent with the fact that component D, which shows the highest
relative continuum level, has brightened by 0.07 mag since Dec 2001. We find
that the emission line flux ratios between the components are in better
agreement with simple lens models than broad band or continuum measurements,
but that the discrepancies between model and data are still unacceptably large.
Finally, we present a detection of the lensing galaxy, although this is close
to the limits of the data. Comparing with a model galaxy spectrum, we obtain a
redshift estimate of z_lens=0.44+-0.02.

  Issue","Astrophys.J.598:86-96,2003","10.1086/377731",,"astro-ph",,"  All the analyses of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature maps
up--to--date show that CMB anisotropies follow a Gaussian distribution. On the
other hand, astrophysical foregrounds which hamper the detection of the CMB
angular power spectrum, are not Gaussian distributed on the sky. Therefore,
they should give a sizeable contribution to the CMB bispectrum. In fact, the
first year data of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) mission have
allowed the {\it first} detection of the extragalactic source contribution to
the CMB bispectrum at 41 GHz and, at the same time, much tighter limits than
before to non--Gaussian primordial fluctuations. In view of the above and for
achieving higher precision in current and future CMB measurements of
non--Gaussianity, in this paper we discuss a comprehensive assessment of the
bispectrum due to either uncorrelated and clustered extragalactic point sources
in the whole frequency interval around the CMB intensity peak. Our
calculations, based on current cosmological evolution models for sources, show
that the reduced angular bispectrum due to point sources, $b_{ps}$, should be
detectable in all WMAP and Planck frequency channels. We also find agreement
with the results on $b_{ps}$ at 41 GHz coming from the analysis of the first
year WMAP data. Moreover, by comparing $b_{ps}$ with the primordial reduced CMB
bispectrum, we find that only the peak value of the primordial bispectrum
(which appears at $l\simeq 200$) results greater than $b_{ps}$ in a frequency
window around the intensity peak of the CMB. The amplitude of this window
basically depends on the capability of the source detection algorithms (i.e.,
on the achievable flux detection limit, $S_{lim}$, for sources).

(Stuttgart). One simulation is axisymmetric and purely hydrodynamic, but with a
resolution of 20 points per beam-radius (ppb). The bipolar jet is injected in
the center of a spherically symmetric King profile, initially underdense to its
environment by a factor of 10,000. As expected from our previous work, the jet
starts with producing a spherical bubble around it, bounded by the bow shock.
The bubble slowly elongates, first with roughly elliptical shape, and then
forms narrower extensions in beam direction. The final aspect ratio of the bow
shock is 1.8. We have transformed the results on a 3D-rectangular grid and
integrated the emission properties to compare the results with observed central
cluster radio galaxies. In the particular case of Cygnus A, we come to
convincing consistency, morphologically, regarding the size of the influenced
region by the jet, size, and cylindrical shape of the radio cocoon, and source
age. This strongly supports our earlier hypothesis on the nature of the jet in
Cygnus A, and the derived constraints on other jet parameters like a power of
$8 \times 10^{46}$ erg/s and an age of 27 Myr. But, the simulation also clearly
shows the shortcoming of the model: The jet's beam is very unstable, reaching
the tip of the bow shock only very seldom. Also, the contact discontinuity
between shocked beam plasma and shocked ambient gas is quite disrupted by the
action of the Kelvin-Helmholtz-instability. This is not seen in observations,
and necessitates the presence of dynamically important magnetic fields or an at
least moderately relativistic flow, or both. [abridged]

morphological information from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging: the
surface brightness profile is smooth, symmetric and compact with no underlying

accounts of all the above results is a nuclear starburst that harbours a young

2 km/s, respectively) resolution of these observations, along with our
multicolor optical and near-infrared imaging, allow us to measure the shape of
the density profile of the dark matter halo with good precision. We find that
the total (baryonic plus dark matter) mass distribution of NGC 2976 follows a
rho_tot ~ r^(-0.27 +/- 0.09) power law out to a radius of 1.8 kpc, assuming
that the observed radial motions provide no support. The density profile
attributed to the dark halo is even shallower, consistent with a nearly
constant density of dark matter over the entire observed region. A maximal disk
fit yields an upper limit to the K-band stellar mass-to-light ratio (M*/L_K) of
0.09^{+0.15}_{-0.08} M_sun/L_sun,K (including systematic uncertainties), with
the caveat that for M*/L_K > 0.19 M_sun/L_sun,K the dark matter density
increases with radius, which is unphysical. Assuming 0.10 M_sun/L_sun,K <
M*/L_K < 0.19 M_sun/L_sun,K, the dark matter density profile lies between
rho_dm ~ r^-0.17 and rho_dm ~ r^-0.01. Therefore, independent of any
assumptions about the stellar disk or the functional form of the density
profile, NGC 2976 does not contain a cuspy dark matter halo. We also
investigate some of the systematic effects that can hamper rotation curve
studies, and show that 1) longslit rotation curves are far more vulnerable to
systematic errors than two-dimensional velocity fields, 2) NGC 2976 contains
large radial motions at small radii, and 3) the Halpha and CO velocity fields
of NGC 2976 agree within their uncertainties. [slightly abridged]

that at least a portion of its overall emission is produced within a compact
accretion torus. This inference is strengthened by observations of strong
linear polarization (at the 10 percent level) within this bump. No linear
polarization has been detected yet at other wavelengths. Given that radiation
from this source is produced on progressively smaller spatial scales with
increasing frequency, the mm/Sub-mm bump apparently arises within a mere
handful of Schwarzschild radii of the black hole. We have found that a small
(10-Schwarzschild-radii) magnetized accretion torus can not only account for
the spectral bump via thermal synchrotron processes, but that it can also
reproduce the corresponding polarimetric results. In addition, the quiescent
X-ray emission appears to be associated with synchrotron self-Comptonization,
while X-ray flares detected from Sgr A* may be induced by a sudden enhancement
of accretion through this torus. This picture predicts correlations among the
mm, IR, and X-ray flux densities, that appear to be consistent with recent
multi-wavelength observations. Further evidence for such a torus in Sgr A* is
provided by its radio variability. Recent monitoring of Sgr A* at cm and mm
wavelengths suggests for a spectral break at 3 mm during cm/Sub-mm flares.
Radio emission from Sgr A* is intriguing since it is circularly polarized
though no linear polarization was ever detected. We first proved that the
emission must be due to nonthermal process should the flow be bounded. It is
then suggested that the nonthermal electrons are energized very close to the

nuclear point source, NGC 4410A contains diffuse X-ray emission, including an
X-ray ridge extending out to about 12"" (6 kpc) to the northwest of the nucleus.
This ridge is coincident with an arc of optical emission-line gas, which has
previously been shown to have optical line ratios consistent with shock
ionization. This structure may be due to an expanding superbubble of hot gas
caused by supernovae and stellar winds or by the active nucleus. The Chandra
observations also show four or five possible compact ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX)
sources (L(x) >= 10^39 erg/s) associated with NGC 4410A. At least one of these

decomposed into two apparently disconnected components: a highly variable power
law and an almost constant component which contains a broad and strong iron
line. We explore a possible explanation of the puzzling lack of variability of
the iron line, by assuming that the variations of the power law component are
due to changes in the height of the primary source in the near vicinity of a
rotating black hole. Due to the bending of light in the strong field of the
central black hole, the apparent brightness of the power-law component can vary
by about a factor 4 according to its position, while the total iron line flux
variability is less than 20 percent. This behaviour is obtained if the primary
source is located within 3-4 gravitational radii ($r_{\rm g}$) from the
rotation axis with a variable height of between $\sim$ 3 and 8 $r_{\rm g}$.
These results revive the possibility that future X-ray observations of
MCG-6-30-15 can map out the strong gravity regime of accreting black holes.

the galactic host that they merge within a Hubble time. We estimate to what
extent this process could contribute to the mass of the super-massive black
holes (SMBHs) observed in galactic centres today. The relation between SMBH and
galactic bulge mass in our model displays the same slope as that found in
observations. Many MBHs will not reach the centre of the host halo, however,
but continue to orbit within it. In doing so MBHs may remain associated with
remnants of the satellite halo systems of which they were previously a part.
Using a semi-analytical approach that explicitly accounts for dynamical
friction, tidal disruption and encounters with galactic disks, we follow the
hierarchical merging of MBH systems and their subsequent dynamical evolution
inside the respective host haloes. We predict the mass and abundance of MBHs in
present-day galactic haloes, and also estimate the MBH mass accretion rates as
well as bolometric luminosities for two different accretion scenarios. MBHs
that have not undergone recent merging will retain associated dark matter cusps
that were enhanced by black hole accretion growth, and may be possible sources
of gamma rays via neutralino annihilations.

results under different circumstances. We then use this method to study cores
that are directly exposed to the interstellar radiation field (non-embedded
cores) and find similar results with previous studies. We also explore a large
number of models of cores that are embedded in the centre of a molecular cloud.
Our study indicates that the temperature profiles in embedded cores are less
steep than those in non-embedded cores. Deeply embedded cores (ambient cloud
with visual extinction larger than 15-25) are almost isothermal at around 7-8
K. The temperature inside cores surrounded by an ambient cloud of even moderate
thickness (Av~5) is less than 12 K, which is lower than previous studies have
assumed. Thus, previous mass calculations of embedded cores (for example in the
rho Ophiuchi protocluster), based on mm continuum observations, may
underestimate core masses by up to a factor of 2. Our study shows that the best
wavelength region to observe embedded cores is between 400 and 500 microns,
where the core is quite distinct from the background. We also predict that very

noninteracting spinless fermions can all be constructed out of the one-particle

developed a statistical-mechanical analogy between the density matrix
eigenstates and the many-body states of a system of noninteracting fermions.
Each density matrix eigenstate corresponds to a particular set of occupation of
single-particle pseudo-energy levels, and the density matrix eigenstate with
the largest weight, having the structure of a Fermi sea ground state,
unambiguously defines a pseudo-Fermi level. We then outlined the main ideas
behind an operator-based truncation of the density matrix eigenstates, where
single-particle pseudo-energy levels far away from the pseudo-Fermi level are
removed as degrees of freedom. We report numerical evidence for scaling
behaviours in the single-particle pseudo-energy spectrum for different block
sizes $B$ and different filling fractions $\nbar$. With the aid of these
scaling relations, which tells us that the block size $B$ plays the role of an
inverse temperature in the statistical-mechanical description of the density
matrix eigenstates and eigenvalues, we looked into the performance of our
operator-based truncation scheme in minimizing the discarded density matrix
weight and the error in calculating the dispersion relation for elementary

probing'' deals with surface acoustic waves of frequency $\nu_{\rm SAW} \simeq
0.5 - 3$ GHz and intensity $I_{\rm SAW} \simeq 0.1 - 10$ mW/mm. The
acoustically-induced stop gaps in the MC polariton spectrum drastically change
the optical response of MC polaritons. Because an acoustically pumped intrinsic
semiconductor microcavity remains in its ground electronic state, no many-body
effects screen and weaken the resonant acousto-optic Stark effect. In the
meantime, this allows us to work out an exactly-solvable model for resonant
acousto-optics of MC polaritons which deals with giant acousto-optical
nonlinearities. Finally, we discuss possible applications of the proposed
resonant acoustic Stark effect for optical modulation and switching and
describe an acousto-optic device based on a (GaAs) microcavity driven by a
surface acoustic wave.

that a number of bright solitons is produced and this can be interpreted in
terms of the modulational instability of the time-dependent macroscopic wave
function of the Bose condensate. In particular, we derive a simple formula for
the number of solitons that is in good agreement with the numerical results of
3D GPE. By investigating the long time evolution of the soliton train solving
the 1D GPE with three-body dissipation we find that adjacent solitons repel
each other due to their phase difference. In addition, we find that during the
motion of the soliton train in an axial harmonic potential the number of
solitonic peaks changes in time and the density of individual peaks shows an
intermittent behavior. Such a complex dynamics explains the ``missing

spacetime structure. In particular, they fail to distinguish between inertial

detectors undergoing circular motion in an arbitrary static spherically
symmetric spacetime, and give a necessary and sufficient condition for the
response function to vanish when the field is in the static vacuum state. By
examining two particular cases, we show that there is no relation, in general,
between the vanishing of the response function and the fact that the detector
motion is, or is not, geodesic. In static asymptotically flat spacetimes,
however, all rotating detectors are excited in the static vacuum. Thus, in this
particular case the static vacuum appears to be associated with a non-rotating
frame. The implications of these results for the equivalence principle are
considered. In particular, we discuss how to properly formulate the principle
for particle detectors, and show that it is satisfied.

(2460) are consistent with the general pattern of spontaneous breaking of
chiral symmetry in hadrons built of heavy and light quarks, as originally
suggested by us in 1992, and independently by Bardeen and Hill in 1993. The
splitting between the chiral doublers follows from a mixing between the light
constituent quark mass and the velocity of the heavy quark, and vanishes for a
zero constituent quark mass. The general strictures of spontaneous chiral
symmetry breaking constrain the axial charges in the chiral multiplet, and
yield a mass splitting between the chiral doublers of about 345 MeV when the
pion coupling to the doublers is half its coupling to a free quark. The chiral
corrections are small. This phenomenon is generic and extends to all
heavy-light hadrons. We predict the mass splitting for the chiral doublers of
the excited mesons (D1,D2). We suggest that the heavy-light doubling can be
used to address issues of chiral symmetry restoration in dense and/or hot
hadronic matter. In particular, the relative splitting between D and D* mesons
and their chiral partners decreases in matter, with consequences on charmonium
evolution at RHIC.

discuss the chiral expansion of the nucleon mass. Contrary to other claims in
the literature we show that the mass of a nucleon in heavy baryon chiral
perturbation theory has a well behaved chiral expansion up to effective
Goldstone boson masses of 400 MeV when one utilizes standard dimensional
regularization techniques. With the help of the here developed cutoff scheme we
can demonstrate a well-behaved chiral expansion for the nucleon mass up to 600
MeV of effective Goldstone Boson masses. We also discuss in detail the prize,
in numbers of additional short distance operators involved, that has to be paid
for this extended range of applicability of chiral perturbation theory with
cutoff regularization, which is usually not paid attention to. We also compare
the fourth order result for the chiral expansion of the nucleon mass with
lattice results and draw some conclusions about chiral extrapolations based on
such type of representation.

provides a nontrivial example of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR). This result
is obtained by interpretation of previous results in the field and by
exhibiting an explicit transformation between the phase space algebra for one
particle in 2+1 gravity found by Matschull and Welling and the corresponding
DSR algebra. The identification of 2+1 gravity as a $DSR$ system answers a
number of questions concerning the latter, and resolves the ambiguity of the
basis of the algebra of observables.
  Based on this observation a heuristic argument is made that the algebra of
symmetries of ultra high energy particle kinematics in 3+1 dimensions is
described by some DSR theory.

us to establish a folklore conjecture that the maximal dimension of a

scalar-valued forms. This allows us to explain the critical signatures which
occur in Borcherds' work. Many of the structures which occur at these critical
signatures are especially beautiful and have appeared independently throughout
the literature. We investigate Borcherds-Kac-Moody (BKM) algebras with
denominator formulas that are singular weight automorphic forms. The results of
these investigations suggest that all such BKM algebras are related to orbifold
constructions of vertex algebras and elements of the Monster sporadic group.

making large frequency jumps while keeping the laser in lock. A diode laser is
locked at a variable offset from a Doppler-free spectral feature of rubidium
vapor. This is done by frequency shifting the laser before sending the light to
a spectroscopy cell with an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). The frequency of the
locked laser is switched quasi-instantaneously over much more than the width of
the spectral features, i.e. the usual locking range. This is done by
simultaneously switching the AOM frequency and applying feed-forward to the
laser current. The advantage of our technique is that power loss and beam walk
caused by the AOM do not affect the main output beam, but only the small
fraction of light used for the spectroscopy. The transient excursions of the
laser frequency are only a few MHz and last approximately 0.2 ms, limited by
the bandwidth of our locking electronics. We present equations that describe
the transient behavior of the error signal and the laser frequency
quantitatively. They are in good agreement with the measurements. The technique
should be applicable to other types of lasers.

$\CP$-symmetry Hamiltonian, and it is shown that a consistent physical theory
of quantum mechanics can be built on a ${\cal C} \CP$-symmetry Hamiltonian. In
particular, we show that these theories have unitary time evolution, and
conservation probability. Furthermore, transition from quantum mechanics to
classical mechanics is investigate and it is found that the Ehrenfest theorem
is satisfied.

packet solutions of the Schr\""odinger equation for two-dimensional infinite
well and quantum billiard problems with equilateral triangle, square, and
circular footprints. These cases correspond to N=3, N=4, and $N \to \infty$
regular polygonal billiards and infinite wells, respectively. In each case the
energy eigenvalues and wavefunctions are given in terms of familiar special
functions. For the first two systems, we obtain closed form expressions for the
expansion coefficients for localized Gaussian wavepackets in terms of the
eigenstates of the particular geometry. For the circular case, we discuss
numerical approaches. We use these results to discuss the short-time,
quasi-classical evolution in these geometries and the structure of wave packet
revivals. We also show how related half-well problems can be easily solved in
each of the three cases.

  Computational Complexity (CCC 2003)",,"10.1109/CCC.2003.1214420",,"quant-ph",,"  We introduce a ``Statistical Query Sampling'' model, in which the goal of an
algorithm is to produce an element in a hidden set $Ssubseteqbit^n$ with
reasonable probability. The algorithm gains information about $S$ through
oracle calls (statistical queries), where the algorithm submits a query
function $g(cdot)$ and receives an approximation to $Pr_{x in S}[g(x)=1]$. We
show how this model is related to NMR quantum computing, in which only
statistical properties of an ensemble of quantum systems can be measured, and
in particular to the question of whether one can translate standard quantum
algorithms to the NMR setting without putting all of their classical
post-processing into the quantum system. Using Fourier analysis techniques
developed in the related context of {em statistical query learning}, we prove a
number of lower bounds (both information-theoretic and cryptographic) on the
ability of algorithms to produces an $xin S$, even when the set $S$ is fairly
simple. These lower bounds point out a difficulty in efficiently applying NMR
quantum computing to algorithms such as Shor's and Simon's algorithm that
involve significant classical post-processing. We also explicitly relate the
notion of statistical query sampling to that of statistical query learning.

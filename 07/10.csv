shows a peculiar behaviour never detected before in any other class of objects.
For [N/H] < -3 there is a plateau with [N/Si]= -1.45(\pm 0.05). We interpret
this as empirical evidence for primary N production by massive stars in young
systems where AGB stars have not yet had time to make their contribution. The
plateau provides the observational integrated yields for N production by
massive stars which are theoretically rather uncertain. High N/Si and solar
[alpha/iron-peak] ratios are observed at high redshift and place at an earlier
epoch the onset of star formation. On the other hand, low N/Si, i.e. young
objects, are observed also at relatively low redshifts. These evidences suggest
that DLAs started to be formed at a very early epoch but their formation has
been extended up to later times.

To appear in ApJ","Astrophys.J.597:48-56,2003","10.1086/378272",,"astro-ph",,"  Deuterium plays a crucial role in cosmology because the primordial D/H
abundance, in the context of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) theory, yields a
precise measure of the cosmic baryon content. Observations of D/H can limit or
measure the true primordial abundance because D is thought to be destroyed by
stars and thus D/H monotonically decreases after BBN. Recently, however, Mullan
& Linsky have pointed out that D arises as a secondary product of neutrons in
stellar flares which then capture on protons via n+p \to d + gamma, and that
this could dominate over direct D production in flares. Mullan & Linsky note
that if this process is sufficiently vigorous in flaring dwarf stars, it could
lead to significant non-BBN D production. We have considered the production of
D in stellar flares, both directly and by n capture. We find that for
reasonable flare spectra, n/d < 10 and (n+d)/6Li < 400, both of which indicate
that the n-capture channel does not allow for Galactic D production at a level
which will reverse the monotonic decline of D. We also calculate the 2.22 MeV
gamma-ray line production associated with n capture, and find that existing
COMPTEL limits also rule out significant D production in the Galaxy today.
Thus, we find flares in particular, and neutron captures in general, are not an
important Galactic source of D. On the other hand, we cannot exclude that flare
production might contribute to recent FUSE observations of large variations in
the local interstellar D/H abundance; we do, however, offer important
constraints on this possibility. Finally, since flare stars should inevitably
produce some n-capture events, a search for diffuse 2.22 MeV gamma-rays by
INTEGRAL can further constrain (or measure!) Galactic deuterium production via
n-capture.

The
epoch of the end of reionization and the Thomson scattering optical depth to
the cosmic microwave background depend on the power spectrum amplitude on small
scales and on the ionizing photon emissivity per unit mass in collapsed halos.
We calibrate the emissivity to reproduce the measured ionizing background
intensity at z=4. Models in which all CDM halos have either a constant
emissivity or a constant energy emitted per Hubble time, per unit mass, predict
that reionization ends near z~6 and the optical depth is in the range 0.05 <
tau_e < 0.09, consistent with WMAP results at the 1 to 2 sigma level. If the
optical depth is as high as 0.17 (as suggested by WMAP), halos of velocity
dispersion ~ 3-30 km/s at z>15 must have ionizing emissivities per unit mass
larger by a factor >~ 50 compared to the more massive halos that produce the
ionizing emissivity at z=4. This factor increases to 100 if the CDM power
spectrum amplitude is required to agree with the Croft et al. (2002)
measurement from the Lyman alpha forest. If tau_e >~ 0.17 were confirmed, a
higher ionizing emissivity at z>15 compared to z=4 might arise from an enhanced
star formation rate or quasar abundance per unit mass and an increased escape
fraction for ionizing photons; the end of reionization could have been delayed
to z~6 because of the suppression of gas accretion and star formation in
low-mass halos as the medium was reionized.

free-free absorption in both the unshocked stellar wind envelopes and the
shocked gas, synchrotron self-absorption, and the Razin effect. The
applicability of these calculations to modelling radio images and spectra of
colliding-wind systems is demonstrated with models of the radio emission from
the wide WR+OB binary WR147. Its synchrotron spectrum follows a power-law
between 5 and 15 GHz but turns down to below this at lower and higher
frequencies. We find that while free-free opacity from the circum-binary
stellar winds can potentially account for the low-frequency turnover, models
that also include a combination of synchrotron self-absorption and Razin effect
are favoured. We argue that the high-frequency turn down is a consequence of
inverse-Compton cooling. We present our resulting spectra and intensity
distributions, along with simulated MERLIN observations of these intensity
distributions. From these we argue that the inclination of the WR147 system to

magnitudes (Mv) of the 47 Tuc CVs suggests they have low accretion rates. The
median Fx/Fopt value for the 47 Tuc CVs is higher than that of all known

high X-ray luminosities (Lx). The latter are only seen in DQ Her systems in the

Some combination of magnetic behavior and low accretion rates may be able to
explain our observations, but the results at present are ambiguous, since no

those of the 47 Tuc CVs. The radial distribution of the X-ray detected active

underdensity of the void. We derive the values of $\Omega_M$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda}$, and $H_0$ that describe this evolution. We examine how the
growth rate of structure and scale factor in a void differ from the background
universe. Together with a prescription for the power spectrum of fluctuations,
these equations provide the initial conditions for running specialized void
simulations. The increased efficiency of such simulations, in comparison with
general-purpose simulations, allows an improvement of upwards of twenty in the
mass resolution. As a sanity check, we run a moderate resolution simulation
($N=128^3$ particles) and confirm that the resulting mass function of void
halos is consistent with other theoretical and numerical models.

spheroidal galaxies and active nuclei at their centers. Within dark matter
halos, forming at the rate predicted by the canonical hierarchical clustering
scenario, the gas evolution is controlled by gravity, radiative cooling, and
heating by feedback from supernovae and from the growing active nucleus.
Supernova heating is increasingly effective with decreasing binding energy in
slowing down the star formation and in driving gas outflows. The more massive
proto-galaxies virializing at earlier times are thus the sites of the faster
star-formation. The correspondingly higher radiation drag fastens the angular
momentum loss by the gas, resulting in a larger accretion rate onto the central
black-hole. In turn, the kinetic energy carried by outflows driven by active
nuclei can unbind the residual gas, thus halting both the star formation and
the black-hole growth, in a time again shorter for larger halos. For the most
massive galaxies the gas unbinding time is short enough for the bulk of the
star-formation to be completed before type Ia supernovae can substantially
increase the $Fe$ abundance of the interstellar medium, thus accounting for the
$\alpha$-enhancement seen in the largest galaxies. The feedback from supernovae
and from the active nucleus also determines the relationship between the
black-hole mass and the mass, or the velocity dispersion, of the host galaxy,
as well as the black-hole mass function. These and other model predictions are
in excellent agreement with observations for a number of observables which
proved to be extremely challenging for all the current semi-analytic models,
including the sub-mm counts and the corresponding redshift distributions, and
the epoch-dependent K-band luminosity function of spheroidal galaxies.

function prescription to parameterize the properties of their hosting halos and
the efficiency of halo-dependent star formation. We find that the two LBG
samples are well described by the halo model with an appropriate HOF. We obtain
constraints on properties of their hosting halos. A typical mass of hosting
halos for LBGs is 5\times10^{11}h^{-1}M_\odot and the expected number of LBGs
per halo is \sim0.5, therefore there is an approximate one-to-one
correspondence between halos and LBGs. We also find a sign of the minimum mass
of LBG hosting halos decreasing with time. We discuss implications of these
findings on the star formation history of LBGs. On the other hand, for LAEs,
our simple HOF prescription fails to reproduce simultaneously the observed
angular correlation function and the number density. This might imply either
that the distribution of LAEs within hosting halos differs from that of dark
matter, or that the strong large-scale correlation is due to the existence of
an unusual, large overdense region, and so the survey region is not a
representative of the z\sim5 universe, the definite answer should wait for a

bipolar regions or (c) of nested rings of opposite polarity. We take as an
example the young, rapid rotator AB Dor (rotation period = 0.514 days). By
adding these model polar fields into the surface field maps determined from
Zeeman-Doppler imaging, we have compared the resulting coronal structure with
the observable properties of the corona - the magnitude and rotational
modulation of the X-ray emission measure and the presence of slingshot
prominences trapped in the corona around the Keplerian co-rotation radius. We
find that only the presence of a unipolar spot has any significant effect on
the overall coronal structure, forcing much of the polar field to be open.

to a logarithmic function. The height of the microwave photoconductivity maxima
and the depth of its minima are nonmonotonic functions of the electric field.
It is pointed to the possibility of a strong widening of the maxima and minima
due to a strong sensitivity of their parameters on the electric field and the
presence of strong long-range electric-field fluctuations. The obtained
dependences are consistent with the results of the experimental observations.

particular, we focus on the effects of history on the relaxation of the excess
conductance dG. The natural relaxation law of dG is logarithmic, namely
dG=-log(t). This may be observed over more than five decades following, for
example, cool-quenching the sample from high temperatures. On the other hand,
when the system is excited from a state S_{o} in which it has not fully reached
equilibrium to a state S_{n}, the ensuing relaxation law is logarithmic only
over time t shorter than the time t_{w} it spent in S_{o}. For times t>t_{w}
dG(t) show systematic deviation from the logarithmic dependence. It was
previously shown that when the energy imparted to the system in the excitation
process is small, this leads to dG=P(t/t_{w}) (simple-aging). Here we test the
conjecture that `simple-aging' is related to a symmetry in the relaxation
dynamics in S_{o} and S_{n}. This is done by using a new experimental procedure
that is more sensitive to deviations in the relaxation dynamics. It is shown
that simple-aging may still be obeyed (albeit with a modified P(t/t_{w})) even
when the symmetry of relaxation in S_{o} and S_{n} is perturbed by a certain
degree. The implications of these findings to the question of aging, and the
energy scale associated with correlations are discussed.

transition, depending on the solution algorithm, easy-hard transitions in the
typical running time of the algorithms occur.
  We explain a statistical mechanics approach, which works by mapping VC to a
hard-core lattice gas, and then applying techniques like the replica trick or
the cavity approach. Using these methods, the phase diagram of VC could be
obtained exactly for connectivities $c<e$, where VC is replica symmetric.
Recently, this result could be confirmed using traditional mathematical
techniques. For $c>e$, the solution of VC exhibits full replica symmetry
breaking.
  The statistical mechanics approach can also be used to study analytically the
typical running time of simple complete and incomplete algorithms for VC.

transfer-matrix method developed in our preceding paper. This method allows us
to survey various statistical measures for the partition sum. The role of the
statistical measures is arousing much attention, since Pinnow and Helfrich
claimed that under a suitable statistical measure, that is, the local mean
curvature, the fluid membranes are stiffened, rather than softened, by thermal
undulations. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to observe the
effective bending moduli directly: We subjected a fluid membrane to a curved
reference plane, and from the free-energy cost due to the reference-plane
deformations, we read off the effective bending moduli. Accepting the
mean-curvature measure, we found that the effective bending rigidity gains even
in the case of very flexible membrane (small bare rigidity); it has been rather
controversial that for such non-perturbative regime, the analytical prediction
does apply. We also incorporate the Gaussian-curvature modulus, and calculated
its effective rigidity. Thereby, we found that the effective Gaussian-curvature
modulus stays almost scale-invariant. All these features are contrasted with
the results under the normal-displacement measure.

temperature $T_X$ which marks the onset of AF short-range order. Directional
fluctuations (spin waves) are described by a non-linear sigma model
(NL$\sigma$M) that we derive from the Hubbard model. At zero temperature and
weak coupling, our results are typical of a Slater antiferromagnet. The AF gap
is exponentially small; there are well-defined Bogoliubov quasi-particles
(QP's) (carrying most of the spectral weight) coexisting with a high-energy
incoherent excitation background. As $U$ increases, the Slater antiferromagnet
progressively becomes a Mott-Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The Bogoliubov bands
evolve into Mott-Hubbard bands separated by a large AF gap. A significant
fraction of spectral weight is transferred from the Bogoliubov QP's to
incoherent excitations. At finite temperature, there is a metal-insulator
transition between a pseudogap phase at weak coupling and a Mott-Hubbard
insulator at strong coupling. Finally, we point out that our results
straightforwardly translate to the half-filled attractive Hubbard model, where
the ${\bf q}=(\pi,\pi)$ charge and ${\bf q}=0$ pairing fluctuations combine to

consider a model which generalize the (flat) FRW one by introducing a first
order inhomogeneous term, whose dynamics is induced by an effective
cosmological constant. The 3-metric tensor is constituted by a dominant term,
corresponding to an isotropic-like component, while the amplitude of the first
order one is controlled by a ``small'' function $\eta(t)$.
  In a Universe filled with ultrarelativistic matter and a real
self-interacting scalar field, we discuss the resulting dynamics, up to first
order in $\eta$, when the scalar field performs a slow roll on a plateau of a
symmetry breaking configuration and induces an effective cosmological constant.
  We show how the spatial distribution of the ultrarelativistic matter and of
the scalar field admits an arbitrary form but nevertheless, due to the required
inflationary e-folding, it cannot play a serious dynamical role in tracing the
process of structures formation (via the Harrison--Zeldovic spectrum). As a
consequence, this paper reinforces the idea that the inflationary scenario is
incompatible with a classical origin of the large scale structures.

possible by the kinematics of a system of geometrical clocks whose tickings are
controlled by cavities which are expanding inertially. For the purpose of
measuring the radiation from such a source we take advantage of the physical
validity of a spacetime coordinate framework (``inertially expanding frame'')
based on such clocks. They are compatible and commensurable with the
accelerated clocks of the accelerated source. By contrast, a common Lorentz
frame with its mutually static clocks won't do: it lacks that commensurability.
Inertially expanding clocks give a physicist a window into the frame of a
source with extreme acceleration. He thus can locate that source and measure
radiation from it without being subjected to such acceleration himself. The
conclusion is that inertially expanding reference frames reveal qualitatively
distinct aspects of nature which would not be accessible if static inertial

potential and zero temperature is analyzed in QCD at strong coupling. In
agreement with other strong coupling analysis, it is found that a first order
phase transition separates a low density phase with chiral symmetry
spontaneously broken from a high density phase where chiral symmetry is
restored. In none of the phases diquark condensation takes place as an
equilibrium state, but, for any value of the chemical potential, there is a
metastable state characterized by a non-vanishing diquark condensate. The
energy difference between this metastable state and the equilibrium state
decreases with the chemical potential and is minimum in the high density phase.
The results indicate that there is attraction in the quark-quark sector also at
strong coupling, and that the attraction is more effective at high baryon
density, but for infinite coupling it is not enough to produce diquark
condensation. It is argued that the absence of diquark condensation is not a
peculiarity of the strong coupling limit, but persists at sufficiently large
finite couplings.

very much suppressed in the Standard Model, at the level of 10^{-15} for Higgs
boson masses of a few hundred GeV. Therefore, any experimental vestige of them
would immediately call for new physics. In this paper we consider the FCNC
decays of Higgs bosons into a top quark in a general two-Higgs-doublet model
(2HDM). The isolated top quark signature, unbalanced by any other heavy
particle, should help to identify the potential FCNC events much more than any
other final state. We compute the maximum branching ratios and the number of
FCNC Higgs boson decay events at the LHC collider at CERN. The most favorable
mode for production and subsequent FCNC decay is the lightest CP-even state in
the Type II 2HDM, followed by the other CP-even state, if it is not very heavy,
whereas the CP-odd mode can never be sufficiently enhanced. Our calculation
shows that the branching ratios of the CP-even states may reach 10^{-5}, and
that several hundred events could be collected in the highest luminosity runs
of the LHC. We also point out some strategies to use these FCNC decays as a
handle to discriminate between 2HDM and supersymmetric Higgs bosons.

of standard gauge field theory in the framework of the scale relativity theory.
Owing to the principle of the relativity of scales, the scale-space is not
absolute. Therefore, the scale variables are functions of the space-time
coordinates, so that we expect a coupling between the displacement in
space-time and the dilation/contraction of the scale variables, which are
identified with gauge transformations. The gauge fields naturally appear as a
new geometric contribution to the total variation of the scale variables. The
gauge charges emerge as the generators of the scale transformation group
applied to a generalized action (now identified with the scale relativistic
invariant) and are therefore the conservative quantities which find their
origin in the symmetries of the scale-space. We recover the expression for the
covariant derivative of non-Abelian gauge theory. Under the gauge
transformations, the fermion multiplets and the boson field transform in such a
way that the Lagrangian, which is here derived instead of being set as a
founding axiom, remains invariant. We have therefore obtained gauge theories as
a consequence of scale symmetries issued from a geometric fractal space-time
description, which we apply to peculiar examples of the electroweak and grand
unified theories.

  Andr\'e-Quillen Homology","12 pages",,,,"math.AC math.AT",,"  The use of homological and homotopical devices, such as Tor and
Andr\'e-Quillen homology, have found substantial use in characterizing
commutative algebras. The primary category setting has been differentially
graded algebras and modules, but recently simplicial categories have also
proved to be useful settings. In this paper, we take this point of view up a
notch by extending some recent uses of homological algebra in characterizing
Noetherian commutative algebras to characterizing simplicial commutative
algebras having finite Noetherian homotopy through the use of simplicial
homotopy theory. These characterizations involve extending the notions of
locally complete intersections and locally Gorenstein algebras to the
simplicial homotopy setting.

$D_{s}(A|R;-) = 0$ for s>2. In an earlier paper, the author posed an extended
version of this conjecture which considered A to be a simplicial commutative
R-algebra with Noetherian homotopy such that the characteristic of $\pi_{0}A$
is non-zero. In addition, a homotopy characterization of such algebras was
described. The main goal of this paper is to develop a strategy for
establishing this extended conjecture and provide a complete proof when R is
Cohen-Macaulay of characteristic 2.

allow us to simulate both strong beta-sheet and weaker attachment bonds between

vitro experiments. We argue that these constraints on rules may correspond to
underlying steric constraints on the aggregation process. We find that monomer
dominated growth of the areal aggregate is too slow to account for some
observed doubling time-to-incubation time ratios inferred from data, and so
consider aggregation dominated by relatively stable but non-infectious
oligomeric intermediates. We compare a kinetic theory analysis of oligomeric
aggregation to spatially explicit simulations of the process. We find that with
suitable rules for misfolding of oligomers, possibly due to water exclusion by
the surrounding aggregate, the resulting oligomeric aggregation model maps onto
our previous monomer aggregation model. Therefore it can produce some of the
same attractive features for the description of prion incubation time data. We
propose experiments to test the oligomeric aggregation model.

and I is almost as old as quantum mechanics itself and since decades a strongly
debated but still unresolved issue in quantum optics. The present paper
proposes a new approach to the problem, namely quantization in terms of the
group SO(1,2): The crucial point is that the phase space S^2 = {phi mod 2pi,
I>0} has the global structure S^1 x R^+ (a simple cone) and cannot be quantized
in the conventional manner. As the group SO(1,2) acts appropriately on that
space its unitary representations of the positive discrete series provide the
correct quantum theoretical framework. The space S^2 has the conic structure of
an orbifold R^2/Z_2. That structure is closely related to the center Z_2 of the
symplectic group Sp(2,R). The basic variables on S^2 are the functions h_0 = I,
h_1 = I cosphi and h_2 = -I sinphi, the Poisson brackets of which obey the Lie
algebra so(1,2). In the quantum theory they are represented by self-adjoint
generators K_0, K_1 and K_2 of a unitary representation. A crucial prediction
is that the classical Pythagorean relation h_1^2+h_2^2 = h_0^2 may be violated
in the quantum theory. For each representation one can define 3 different types
of coherent states the complex phases of which can be ""measured"" by means of
K_1 and K_2 alone without introducing any new phase operators! The SO(1,2)
structure of optical squeezing and interference properties as well as that of
the harmonic oscillator are analyzed in detail. The new coherent states can be
used for the introduction of (Husimi type) Q and (Sudarshan-Glauber type) P
representations of the density operator. The 3 operators K_0, K_1 and K_2 are
fundamental in the sense that one can construct (composite) position and

quantum systems have a physical interpretation? In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. A
66, 012108 (2002)] we investigated this question using the orthodox
interpretation of quantum mechanics. We found that the solution of a
non-Markovian SSE represents the state the system would be in at that time if a
measurement was performed on the environment at that time, and yielded a
particular result. However, the linking of solutions at different times to make
a trajectory is, we concluded, a fiction. In this paper we investigate this
question using the modal (hidden variable) interpretation of quantum mechanics.
We find that the noise function $z(t)$ appearing in the non-Markovian SSE can
be interpreted as a hidden variable for the environment. That is, some chosen
property (beable) of the environment has a definite value $z(t)$ even in the
absence of measurement on the environment. The non-Markovian SSE gives the
evolution of the state of the system ``conditioned'' on this environment hidden
variable. We present the theory for diffusive non-Markovian SSEs that have as
their Markovian limit SSEs corresponding to homodyne and heterodyne detection,
as well as one which has no Markovian limit.

  pendulum","27 pages, 8 embedded .eps figures; to appear, Annals of Physics",,"10.1016/S0003-4916(03)00171-4",,"quant-ph",,"  The rigid pendulum, both as a classical and as a quantum problem, is an
interesting system as it has the exactly soluble harmonic oscillator and the
rigid rotor systems as limiting cases in the low- and high-energy limits
respectively. The energy variation of the classical periodicity ($\tau$) is
also dramatic, having the special limiting case of $\tau \to \infty$ at the
'top' of the classical motion (i.e. the separatrix.) We study the
time-dependence of the quantum pendulum problem, focusing on the behavior of
both the (approximate) classical periodicity and especially the quantum revival
and superrevival times, as encoded in the energy eigenvalue spectrum of the
system. We provide approximate expressions for the energy eigenvalues in both
the small and large quantum number limits, up to 4th order in perturbation
theory, comparing these to existing handbook expansions for the characteristic
values of the related Mathieu equation, obtained by other methods. We then use
these approximations to probe the classical periodicity, as well as to extract
information on the quantum revival and superrevival times. We find that while
both the classical and quantum periodicities increase monotonically as one
approaches the 'top' in energy, from either above or below, the revival times
decrease from their low- and high-energy values until very near the separatrix
where they increase to a large, but finite value.

the Hamiltonian and the stochastic terms do not commute. The numerical solution
of the equations of motions allows to give precise estimates on the regime at
which the collapse of the state vector occurs, the reduction and delocalization
times, and the reduction probabilities; it also allows to quantify the effect
that an Hamiltonian which does not commute with the reducing terms has on the
collapse mechanism. We also give a clear picture of the transition from the
""microscopic"" regime (when the noise terms are weak and the Hamiltonian
prevents the state vector to collapse) to the ""macroscopic"" regime (when the
noise terms are dominant and the collapse becomes effective for very long
times). Finally, we clarify the distinction between decoherence and collapse.

  2004), pp. 403-412",,,"quant-ph",,"  The Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz rule assigns probabilities to quantum
measurement results at time t on the condition that the system is prepared in a
given way at t_1 < t and found in a given state at t_2 > t. The question
whether the rule can also be applied counterfactually to the case where no
measurement is performed at the intermediate time t has recently been the
subject of controversy. I argue that the counterfactual meaning may be
understood in terms of the true value of an observable at t. Such a value
cannot be empirically determined for, by stipulation, the measurement that
would yield it is not performed. Nevertheless, it may or may not be
well-defined depending on one's proposed interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Various examples are discussed illustrating what can be asserted at the
intermediate time without running into contradictions.

system in an intense coherent field with frequency lower than the
vacuum-induced decay width. As this additional low-frequency field is assumed
to be intense, multiphoton processes may be induced, which can be seen as
alternative transition pathways in addition to the simple spontaneous decay.
The interplay of the various interfering transition pathways influences the
decay dynamics of the two-level system and may be used to slow down the
spontaneous decay considerably. We derive from first principles an expression
for the Hamiltonian including up to three-photon processes. This Hamiltonian is
then applied to a quantum mechanical simulation of the decay dynamics of the
two-level system. Finally, we discuss numerical results of this simulation
based on a rubidium atom and show that the spontaneous emission in this system
may be suppressed substantially.

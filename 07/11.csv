density may change its sign during the evolution of the universe. This may lead
to a global collapse of the universe within the time t_c ~ 10^{10}-10^{11}
years. Our goal is to find what bounds on the future lifetime of the universe
can be placed by the next generation of cosmological observations. As an
example, we investigate the simplest model of dark energy with a linear
potential V(\phi) =V_0(1+\alpha\phi). This model can describe the present stage
of acceleration of the universe if \alpha is small enough. However, eventually
the field \phi rolls down, V(\phi) becomes negative, and the universe
collapses. The existing observational data indicate that the universe described
by this model will collapse not earlier than t_c > 10 billion years from the
present moment. We show that the data from SNAP and Planck satellites may
extend the bound on the ""doomsday"" time to t_c > 40 billion years at the 95%
confidence level.

of the neutron star atmospheric component remained unchanged. This lends
support to the idea that the power law component arises from emission at the

exploring the posterior distribution of cosmological parameters constrained by
observations of CMB anisotropies. Given an infinite amount of time, any MCMC

considerable amount of time to explore the posterior distribution fully. In the
best case, this results only in wasted CPU time, but in the worse case can lead
to underestimated confidence limits on the values of cosmological parameters.
Even for the current CMB data set, the sampler employed in the widely-used

pronounced for data sets of the quality anticipated for the Planck mission. We
thus propose a new MCMC sampler for analysing total intensity CMB observations,

dynamic widths for proposal distributions, dynamic covariance matrix sampling,
and a dedicated proposal distribution for moving along well-known degeneracy

Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data obtained 14, 26, 32, and 59 days after the
burst, show the host galaxy to have a morphology that is fairly typical of blue
galaxies at high redshift. We measure its magnitude to be R = 24.95 +/- 0.11.
We detect a break in the OA R-band light curve which is naturally accounted for
by a collimated outflow geometry. By fitting a broken power-law to the data we
find a best fit with a break 1.56 +/- 0.02 days after the burst, a pre-break
slope of alpha_1 = -0.95 +/- 0.02, and a post-break slope of alpha_2 = -2.11
+/- 0.07. The UV-optical spectral energy distribution (SED) around 14 hours
after the burst is best fit with a power-law with index beta = -0.56 +/- 0.19
reddened by an SMC-like extinction law with a modest A_V = 0.08 +/- 0.08 mag.

a decay index of alpha_X = -1.62 +/- 0.36 and a spectral index of beta_X =
-1.21 +0.10/-0.15. Interpolating between the UV-optical and X-ray implies that
the cooling frequency is located close to ~10^16 Hz in the observer frame at
the time of the observations. We argue, using the various temporal and spectral
indices above, that the most likely afterglow model is that of a jet expanding
into an external environment that has a constant mean density rather than a
wind-fed density structure. We estimate the electron energy index for this

3$ sigma level even after taking into account that the ERO distribution is
highly inhomogeneous. This is the first systematic investigation of the surface
density of EROs in the fields of radio-loud quasars above z=2, and shows that a
large number of the fields contain clumps of EROs, similar to what is seen only
in the densest areas in random-field surveys. The high surface densities and
angular distribution of EROs suggest that the excess originates in high-z
galaxy concentrations, possibly young clusters of galaxies. The fainter EROs at
K_s>19 mag show some evidence of being more clustered in the immediate 20
arcsec region around the quasars, suggesting an association with the
quasars.Comparing with predictions from spectral synthesis models, we find that
if the $K_s\approx19$ mag ERO excess is associated with the quasars at

of galaxies at $z\approx1$ lying along the line of sight to the quasars. If
this is the case, the EROs may be tracing massive structures responsible for a
magnification bias of the quasars.

the cosmological GRB 030329. The bright radio emission from SN 1998bw indicated
that it possessed some of the unique attributes expected of GRBs, namely a
large reservoir of energy in (mildly) relativistic ejecta and variable energy
input. The two popular scenarios for the origin of SN 1998bw are a typical
cosmological burst observed off-axis or a member of a new distinct class of
supernova explosions (gSNe). In the former, about 0.5% of local Type Ib/c SNe
are expected to be similar to SN1998bw; for the latter no such constraint
exists. Motivated thus, we began a systematic program of radio observations of
most reported Type Ib/c SNe accessible to the Very Large Array. Of the 33 SNe
observed from late 1999 to the end of 2002 at most one is as bright as SN
1998bw. From this we conclude that the incidence of such events is <3%.
Furthermore, analysis of the radio emission indicates that none of the observed
SNe exhibit clear engine signatures. Finally, a comparison of the SN radio
emission to that of GRB afterglows indicates that none of the SNe could have
resulted from a typical GRB, independent of the initial jet orientation. Thus,

plus BD population and explicitly taking into account a high binary proportion
and dynamical evolution in the TA groups and the ONC. The Briceno result is
reproduced almost exactly despite an identical IMF in both systems because many
BD-BD and star-BD binaries are disrupted in the ONC thus freeing BDs, while the
TA groups remain unevolved dynamically. However, the resulting populations do
not have the correct star-star, star-BD and expecially BD-BD binary properties,
even if a variable BD IMF is allowed for. The conclusion is therefore that BDs
need to be added as a separate population which has its own binary properties.
Such an extra population can have various origins which are briefly discussed
in this contribution but more fully in an associated paper.

LF) to the HII region size distribution and density wave triggering in
grand-design spiral galaxies. We suggest that the differential nebular size
distribution is described by a power law of slope ~ -4, with flattening at
radii below ~ 130 pc. This contrasts with the conventional exponential
description, but it is physically and quantitatively consistent with the
typical observed value of -2 for the HII LF slope.
  We have developed an interactive code that computes spatial isochrones for
the evolving loci of spiral density waves in disk galaxies. This allows
comparison of the nebular spatial distribution with the spatial isochrones for
simple rotation curve parameters. Our comparisons for four grand-design
galaxies suggest that the corotation radius r_co coincides with the outer ends
of the star-forming arms. This value for r_co yields the best spatial
correspondence between the HII regions and the isochrones, and also appears to
yield a coincidence between the Inner Lindblad Resonance with the radial onset
of star formation in the arms. Thus, we suggest that isochrones offer a new,
simple, and effective technique for determining r_co, and thus the spiral
pattern speed. However, application of the isochrones also demonstrates that
evolution of the nebular population is difficult to spatially isolate in these
galaxies.

obtained from Fabry-Perot interferometry in Halpha, at significantly enhanced
angular resolution compared with published studies. The main point of the work
is to examine in detail the non-circular components of the velocity field of
the gas, presumably induced by the strongly non-axisymmetric gravitational
potential of the bar. These reveal quasi-elliptical motions with speeds of
order 100 km/s aligned with the bar. It also shows how these flows swing in
towards and around the nucleus as they cross a circumnuclear resonance, from
the dominant ""x1 orbits"" outside the resonance to ""x2 orbits"" within it.
Comparing cross-sections of the residual velocity map along and across the bar
with the Halpha intensity map indicates a systematic offset between regions of
high non-circular velocity and massive star formation. To investigate further
we produce velocity gradient maps along and across the bar. These illustrate
very nicely the shear compression of the gas, revealed by the location of the
dust lanes along loci of maximum velocity gradient perpendicular to the bar.
They also show clearly how shear acts to inhibit massive star formation,
whereas shocks act to enhance it. Although the inhibiting effect of gas shear
flow on star formation has long been predicted, this is the clearest
observational illustration so far of the effect. It is also the clearest
evidence that dust picks out shock-induced inflow along bars. These
observations should be of considerable interest to those modelling massive star
formation in general.

the previously detected glitch and the large amplitude of the new spin-up place
this source among the most frequent glitchers, with large average glitch
amplitudes, similar to those of the Vela pulsar. The source shows different
recoveries after the glitches: in the first one it is well described by a long
term linear trend similar to those seen in Vela-like glitches; in the second
case the recovery is considerably faster and is better described by an
exponential plus a fractional change in the long-term spin-down rate of the
order of 1%. No recovery of the latter is detected but additional observations
are necessary to confirm this result. Observed glitch properties are compared
to those of radio pulsar glitches; current models are discussed in light of our
results. It appears that glitches may represent yet another peculiarity of

Alternative models can be applied to individual glitches but fail in explaining
both. Thus the two events may as well arise from two different mechanisms.

to global flows of charged particles, causes a large electric field along the
magnetic field lines. Migratory electrons and/or positrons are accelerated by
this field to radiate gamma-rays via curvature and inverse-Compton processes.
Some of such gamma-rays collide with the X-rays to materialize as pairs in the
gap. The replenished charges partially screen the electric field, which is
self-consistently solved together with the energy distribution of particles and
gamma-rays at each point along the field lines. By solving the set of Maxwell
and Boltzmann equations, we demonstrate that an external injection of charged
particles at nearly Goldreich-Julian rate does not quench the gap but shifts
its position and that the particle energy distribution cannot be described by a
power-law. The injected particles are accelerated in the gap and escape from it
with large Lorentz factors. We show that such escaping particles migrating
outside of the gap contribute significantly to the gamma-ray luminosity for
young pulsars and that the soft gamma-ray spectrum between 100 MeV and 3 GeV
observed for the Vela pulsar can be explained by this component. We also
discuss that the luminosity of the gamma-rays emitted by the escaping particles
is naturally proportional to the square root of the spin-down luminosity.

galaxies. Their redshifts range from 0.3--1.0, with a median redshift 0.8. The
slope of the relation shows no difference compared with the local slope.
However, there is significant evolution in the zero-point offset; an offset due
to evolution in magnitude requires a 2.4 magnitude luminosity brightening at
z=1. We see little differences of the offset with bulge fraction, which is a
good surrogate for galaxy type. Correcting for the luminosity evolution reduces
the orthogonal scatter in the Fundamental Plane to 8%, consistent with the
local scatter. This scatter is measured for our sample, and does not include
results from other studies which may have different selection effects. The
difference in the degree of evolution between our field sample and published
cluster galaxies suggests a more recent formation epoch--around z=1.5 for field
galaxies compared to z>2.0 for cluster galaxies. The magnitude difference
implies that the field early-type galaxies are about 2 Gyr younger than the
cluster ellipticals using standard single-burst models. However, the same
models imply a significant change in the rest-frame U-B color from then to
present, which is not seen in our sample. Continuous low-level star formation,
however, would serve to explain the constant colors over this large magnitude
change. A consistent model has 7% of the stellar mass created after the initial
burst, using an exponentially decaying star formation rate with an e-folding

electrodes. The magnetization dynamics is characterized by a relaxation time
$t_1$, which strongly depends on temperature, bias voltage, and gate voltage.
While a direct measure of a nanoparticle magnetization might be difficult, we
find that $t_1$ can be determined through a time resolved transport
measurement. For a suitable choice of gate voltage and bias voltage, the
magnetization performs a bias-driven Brownian motion regardless of the presence
of anisotropy.

principle for the empirical density which describes the probability of
fluctuations from the solutions of the hydrodynamic equation. The so called
quasi potential, which measures the cost of a fluctuation from the stationary
state, is then defined by a variational problem for the dynamical large
deviation rate function. By characterizing the optimal path, we prove that the
quasi potential can also be obtained from a static variational problem
introduced by Derrida, Lebowitz, and Speer.

formula for the splitting factor which is equivalent to obtaining the filling

  System",,,,,"cs.NI",,"  It starts out innocently enough - users want to monitor Online data and so
run their own copies of the detector control GUIs in their offices and at home.
But over time, the number of processes making requests for values to display on
GUIs, webpages and stripcharts can grow, and affect the performance of an
Input/Output Controller (IOC) such that it is unable to respond to requests
from requests critical to data-taking. At worst, an IOC can hang, its CPU
having been allocated 100% to responding to network requests.
  For the BaBar Online Detector Control System, we were able to eliminate this
problem and make great gains in security by moving all of the IOCs to a
non-routed, virtual LAN and by enlisting a workstation with two network
interface cards to act as the interface between the virtual LAN and the public
BaBar network. On the interface machine, we run the Experimental Physics
Industrial Control System (EPICS) Channel Access (CA) gateway software
(originating from Advanced Photon Source). This software accepts as inputs, all
the channels which are loaded into the EPICS databases on all the IOCs. It
polls them to update its copy of the values. It answers requests from
applications by sending them the currently cached value.
  We adopted the requirement that data-taking would be independent of the
gateway, so that, in the event of a gateway failure, data-taking would be
uninterrupted. In this way, we avoided introducing any new risk elements to
data-taking. Security rules already in use by the IOC were propagated to the
gateway's own security rules and the security of the IOCs themselves was
improved by removing them from the public BaBar network.

equations of two types: the four elliptic initial data (constraint) equations,

approach is to simply monitor them ({\it unconstrained} evolution).
  The problem of the 3-d computational simulation of even a single isolated
vacuum black hole has proven to be remarkably difficult. Recently, we have
become aware of two publications that describe very long term evolution, at
least for single isolated black holes. An essential feature in each of these
results is {\it constraint subtraction}. Additionally, each of these approaches
is based on what we call ""modern,"" hyperbolic formulations of the Einstein
equations. It is generally assumed, based on computational experience, that the
use of such modern formulations is essential for long-term black hole
stability. We report here on comparable lifetime results based on the much
simpler (""traditional"") $\dot g$ - $\dot K$ formulation.
  We have also carried out a series of {\it constrained} 3-d evolutions of
single isolated black holes. We find that constraint solution can produce
substantially stabilized long-term single hole evolutions. However, we have
found that for large domains, neither constraint-subtracted nor constrained
$\dot g$ - $\dot K$ evolutions carried out in Cartesian coordinates admit
arbitrarily long-lived simulations. The failure appears to arise from features
at the inner excision boundary; the behavior does generally improve with
resolution.

the constituent quark, the double distribution representation of GPDs, and a
recently proposed phenomenological constituent quark form factor. The present
approach permits to access a kinematical range corresponding to both the DGLAP

skewedness parameter. In this kinematical region, the cross sections relevant
to deeply virtual Compton scattering could be estimated by using the obtained
GPDs. As an example, the leading twist, unpolarized GPD $H$ has been
calculated. Its general relations with the non relativistic definition of the

consistently recovered from our expressions.Further natural applications of the

string theory in a maximally supersymmetric plane-wave background to N=4, d=4,
U(N) Super Yang-Mills theory in a particular large N and large R-charge limit
due to Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase. In the first part of these lectures
the duality is derived from the AdS/CFT correspondence by taking a Penrose
limit of the AdS_5 x S^5 geometry and studying the corresponding double-scaling
limit on the gauge theory side. The resulting free plane-wave superstring is
then quantized in light-cone gauge. On the gauge theory side of the
correspondence the composite Super Yang-Mills operators dual to string
excitations are identified, and it is shown how the string spectrum can be
mapped to the planar scaling dimensions of these operators. In the second part
of these lectures we study the correspondence at the interacting respectively
non-planar level. On the gauge theory side it is demonstrated that the large N
large R-charge limit in question preserves contributions from Feynman graphs of
all genera through the emergence of a new genus counting parameter - in
agreement with the string genus expansion for non-zero g_s. Effective quantum
mechanical tools to compute higher genus contributions to the scaling
dimensions of composite operators are developed and explicitly applied in a
genus one computation. We then turn to the interacting string theory side and
give an elementary introduction into light-cone superstring field theory in a
plane-wave background and point out how the genus one prediction from gauge
theory can be reproduced. Finally, we summarize the present status of the
plane-wave string/gauge theory duality.

densities can be negative only when two multi-particle states have the same

could arise, we find that the energy is that of a positive constant plus a
propagating part which oscillates between positive and negative, and the energy
can dip to negative at some places at for a certain period of time if the
quantum states are properly manipulated. It is demonstrated that the negative
energy densities satisfy the quantum inequality. Our results also reveal that
for a given particle content, the detection of negative energy is an operation
that depends on the frame where any measurement is to be performed. This
suggests that the sign of energy density for a quantum state may be a
coordinate-dependent quantity in quantum theory.

supersymmetric Dp branes in terms of the perturbative string formalism. We then
use it for deriving the corresponding supergravity solution and the Born-Infeld
action and for studying the properties of the maximally supersymmetric gauge
theories living on their worldvolume. In the last section of these lectures we
extend these results to less supersymmetric and non-conformal gauge theories by
considering fractional branes of orbifolds and wrapped branes.

possesses 30 $\kappa$-symmetries and 32 target space supersymmetries. The usual
preserved supersymmetry-$\kappa$-symmetry correspondence suggests that it
describes the excitations of a BPS state preserving all but two
supersymmetries. The model can also be formulated in any $\Sigma^{({n(n+1)\over

`higher--spin generalization' of the usual Green--Schwarz superstring. Although
the global symmetry of the model is a generalization of the super--Poincar\'e
group, ${\Sigma}^{({n(n+1)\over 2}|n)}\times\supset Sp(n)$, it may be
formulated in terms of constrained OSp(2n|1) orthosymplectic supertwistors. We
work out this supertwistor realization and its Hamiltonian dynamics.

structure. Therefore, we associate equivariant vector bundles on the projective
plane to trifiltered vector spaces. Making this Rees construction with
filtrations arising from mixed Hodge structures gives an equivalence of
categories between the category of mixed Hodge structures and a category of
equivariant vector bundles on ${\bf P}^{2}_{\bf C}$ that are semistable for a
semistability condition with respect to a divisor. Using this dictionary we can
recover geometrically some properties of mixed Hodge structures like the
abelian caracter of the category of mixed Hodge structures or the fact that
higher extensions vanish.
  Next, looking at the second Chern class of the Rees bundles, we define the
${\bf R}$-split level of the mixed Hodge structures that generalize the notion
of ${\bf R}$-split mixed Hodge structure. This invariant can be expressed in
terms of the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$ and some Hodge-type integers $s^{p,q}$
that are given by the relative position of the Hodge and conjugate filtrations.
When the Hodge numbers are constant for a family of mixed Hodge structures,
these numbers vary semicountinously. This allows to define stratifications of
the bases of variations of mixed Hodge structures.

In this paper we develop novel tools that can be used within this framework and
that are very useful for tracking problems. In particular, results for
stability analysis of parameterized time-varying discrete-time cascaded systems
are given. This class of models arises naturally when one uses an approximate
discrete-time model to design a stabilizing or tracking controller for a
sampled-data plant. While some of our results parallel their continuous-time
counterparts, the stability properties that are considered, the conditions that
are imposed and the the proof techniques that are used are tailored for
approximate discrete-time systems and are technically different from those in
the continuous-time context. We illustrate the utility of our results in the
case study of the tracking control of a mobile robot. This application is
fairly illustrative of the technical differences and obstacles encountered in
the analysis of discrete-time parameterized systems.

stratification of the space of the parameters such that on each stratum, there
is a non zero rational polynomial which is a Bernstein-Sato polynomial for any
point of the stratum. This generalizes a result of A. Leykin obtained in the
case $p=1$.

criteria that need to be met in a practical implementation. We find, however,
that the generally accepted criteria are flawed for a whole class of such
schemes.

ground-state entanglement of two spins, as defined by the concurrence, in the
XXZ- and the transverse field Ising-chain. Correlation function inequalities,
valid in any dimensions for these models, are presented outlining the regimes
where entanglement is unaffected by spontaneous symmetry breaking.

$^9Be^+$ and one $^{24}Mg^+$ ion. Since the respective cooling transitions of
these two species are separated by more than 30 nm, laser manipulation of one
ion has negligible effect on the other even when the ions are not individually
addressed. As such this is a useful system for re-initializing the motional
state in an ion trap quantum computer without affecting the qubit information.
Additionally, we have found that the mass difference between ions enables a
novel method for detecting and subsequently eliminating the effects of radio
frequency (RF) micro-motion.

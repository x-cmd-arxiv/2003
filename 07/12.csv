i) of a sample of 45 candidate field horizontal-branch (HB) stars spanning a
wide range of effective temperature, from red HB stars with Teff ~ 5000 K to
blue HB stars with Teff of 17000 K. Among the cooler blue HB stars (Teff =
7500-11500 K), we confirm prior studies showing that although a majority of
stars rotate at v sin i < 15 km/s, there exists a subset of ""fast rotators""
with v sin i as high as 30-35 km/s. All but one of the red HB stars in our
sample have v sin i < 10 km/s, and no analogous rotation bimodality is evident.
We also identify a narrow-lined hot star (Teff ~ 16000 K) with enhanced
photospheric metal abundances and helium depletion, similar to the abundance
patterns found among hot BHB stars in globular clusters, and four other stars
that may also belong in this category. We discuss details of the spectral line
fitting procedure that we use to deduce v sin i, and explore how measurements
of field HB star rotation may shed light on the issue of HB star rotation in
globular clusters.

Only supernovae are expected to illuminate material on both circumstellar and

high mass-loss rates can produce observable echoes within their circumstellar
envelopes. Echoes from novae and dwarf novae are probably detectable only from
nearby material, and only in unusually dense gas. I present characteristic

determined to be around 425 AU (HWHM) based on model fits to the CO velocity
field. The disk mass derived from the CO isotopologues with ``typical'' dense
cloud abundances is still nearly two orders of magnitude less than that
inferred from the dust emission, which is probably due to extensive molecular
depletion in the cold, dense disk midplane. N2H+ 1-0 emission has also been
detected which, along with HCO+, sets a lower limit to the fractional
ionization of 10^{-8} in the near-surface regions of protoplanetary disks. This
first detection of N2H+ in circumstellar disks has also made possible a
determination of the N2/CO ratio (~2) that is at least an order of magnitude
larger than those in the envelopes of young stellar objects and dense clouds.
The large N2/CO ratio indicates that our observations probe disk layers in
which CO is depleted but some N2 remains in the gas phase. Such differential
depletion can lead to large variations in the fractional ionization with height
in the outer reaches of circumstellar disks, and may help to explain the

of C IV and H beta appear nearly unrelated in individual objects, these FWHMs
are well correlated when averaged over sub-samples in our database. Therefore,
the lines are equally valid indicators of the average SMBH mass in quasar
samples. Our sample spans five orders of magnitude in SMBH mass, six orders of
magnitude in luminosity, and a redshift range from 0 <= z <= 5. Most lines
diminish in equivalent width with increasing black hole mass (the usual
""Baldwin Effect"") and there are no trends with redshift. Recent studies
indicate that there is a relationship between SMBH mass and the overall
bulge/spheroidal component mass of the surrounding galaxy. This relation,
together with the well-known mass-metallicity relationship among galaxies,
predicts a relationship between SMBH mass and quasar metallicity. We estimate
the metallicity in the broad emission line region by comparing several line
ratios involving nitrogen to theoretical predictions. We find that the data are
consistent with a trend between SMBH mass and metallicity, with some line

group is reproduced by stellar models with variable molecular opacities (see

original sub-solar metallicity (i.e. LMC composition). Moreover, we are able to
explain quantitatively both the N/H-He/H correlation and the N/H-C/H
anti-correlation, thus solving the discrepancy pointed out long ago by Becker &

quasars is regarded as a clock of the star formation history and, more
specifically, of the enrichment by SNIa. We investigate the iron abundance in a
sample of 22 quasars in the redshift range 3.0<z<6.4 by measuring their rest
frame UV FeII bump, which is shifted into the near-IR, and by comparing it with
the MgII 2798 flux. The observations were performed with a device that can
obtain near-IR spectra in the range 0.8-2.4 um in one shot, thereby enabling an
optimal removal of the continuum underlying the FeII bump. We detect iron in
all quasars including the highest redshift (z=6.4) quasar currently known. The
uniform observational technique and the wide redshift range allows a reliable
study of the trend of the FeII/MgII ratio with redshift. We find the FeII/MgII
ratio is nearly constant at all redshifts, although there is marginal evidence
for a higher FeII/MgII ratio in the quasars at z~6. If the FeII/MgII ratio
reflects the Fe/alpha abundance, this result suggests that the z~6 quasars have
already undergone a major episode of iron enrichment. We discuss the possible
implications of this finding for the star formation history at z>6. We also
detect a population of weak iron emitters at z~4.5, which are possibly hosted
in systems that evolved more slowly. Alternatively, the trend of the FeII/MgII
ratio at high redshift may reflect significantly different physical conditions
of the circumnuclear gas in such high redshift quasars.

is remarkably constant, T_e[OIII] = 10200K; ii) the bright inner rim and inner
pair of knots have similar densities of N_e = 6000cm^{-3}, whereas a much lower
density of N_e = 1500cm^{-3} is derived for the outer knots as well as for the
jets; iii) all the regions (rim, inner knots, jets and outer knots) are mainly
radiatively excited; and iv) there are no clear abundance changes across the

of nitrogen in the outer knots (ansae), but the inner ones (caps) and the rim
have similar N/H values that are at variance with previous results. Our data
are compared to the predictions of theoretical models, from which we conclude
that the knots at the head of the jets are not matter accumulated during the
jet expansion through the circumstellar medium, neither can their origin be
explained by the proposed HD or MHD interacting-wind models for the formation
of jets/ansae, since the densities as well as the main excitation mechanisms of
the knots, disagree with model predictions.

assume that strong interactions impose a short-range periodicicity of the

equivalently, a $4 k_F$ charge-density wave) is destroyed by impurities. The 3D
array of chains behaves differently at large and at small impurity
concentrations $N$. At large $N$, impurities divide the chains into metallic
rods. The low-temperature conductivity is due to the variable-range hopping of
electrons between the rods. It obeys the Efros-Shklovskii (ES) law and
increases exponentially as $N$ decreases. When $N$ is small, the metallic-rod
picture of the ground state survives only in the form of rare clusters of
atypically short rods. They are the source of low-energy charge excitations. In
the bulk the charge excitations are gapped and the electron crystal is pinned
collectively. A strongly anisotropic screening of the Coulomb potential
produces an unconventional linear in energy Coulomb gap and a new law of the
variable-range hopping $-\ln\sigma \sim (T_1 / T)^{2/5}$. $T_1$ remains
constant over a finite range of impurity concentrations. At smaller $N$ the
2/5-law is replaced by the Mott law, where the conductivity gets suppressed as
$N$ goes down. Thus, the overall dependence of $\sigma$ on $N$ is nonmonotonic.
In 1D, the granular-rod picture and the ES apply at all $N$. The conductivity
decreases exponentially with $N$. Our theory provides a qualitative explanation

probability density function (PDF) exists for the fluctuations in river level,

investigated in this paper are: the PDF of the river flow and river level;
moment scaling with basin area; moment to moment scaling or relative scaling;
and power spectral properties of the data. We find that the moments of the flow
scale approximately with basin area and that the seasonally adjusted flows
exhibit relative moment scaling.
  Compared to the Mississippi, the Danube shows large deviations from spatial
scaling and the power spectra show considerable dependence on system size. This
might be due to water use and regulations as well as inhomogeneities in the
basin area.

qualitatively approximated by the BHP PDF. We discuss why this coincidence

stable homotopy to itself, interacts in striking ways with chromatic aspects of
the stable category.
  Localized at a fixed prime p, let T(n) be the telescope of a v_n self map of
a finite S--module of type n. The Periodicity Theorem of Hopkins and Smith
implies that the Bousfield localization functor associated to T(n) is
independent of choices.
  Goodwillie's general theory says that to any homotopy functor F from
S--modules to S--modules, there is an associated tower under F, {P_dF}, such
that F --> P_dF is the universal arrow to a d--excisive functor.
  Our first theorem says that P_dF --> P_{d-1}F always admits a homotopy
section after localization with respect to T(n) (and so also after localization
with respect to Morava K--theory K(n)). Thus, after periodic localization,
polynomial functors split as the product of their homogeneous factors.
  This theorem follows from our second theorem which is equivalent to the
following: for any finite group G, the Tate spectrum t_G(T(n)) is weakly
contractible. This strengthens and extends previous theorems of
Greenlees--Sadofsky, Hovey--Sadofsky, and Mahowald--Shick. The Periodicity
Theorem is used in an essential way in our proof.
  The connection between the two theorems is via a reformulation of a result of
McCarthy on dual calculus.

3-manifolds by means of branched surfaces. We explain what it means for a
contact structure to be carried by a branched surface embedded in a 3-manifold.
To make the transition from contact structures to branched surfaces, we first
define auxiliary objects called sigma-confoliations and pure contaminations,
both generalizing contact structures. We study various deformations of these
objects and show that the sigma-confoliations and pure contaminations obtained
by suitably modifying a contact structure remember the contact structure up to
isotopy.
  After defining tightness for all pure contaminations in a natural way,
generalizing the definition of tightness for contact structures, we obtain some
conditions on (the embedding of) a branched surface in a 3-manifold sufficient
to guarantee that any pure contamination carried by the branched surface is
tight. We also find conditions sufficient to prove that a branched surface
carries only overtwisted (non-tight) contact structures.

the mechanism of hadronization of highly virtual quark. It is demonstrated that
when the recoiling spectator nucleon is detected in the backward hemisphere

theories are constructions of our mind, and the existence of objects in such
theories is a matter of consistency or coherence of the theory (this allows us
to study them independently of other theories), in physics its not enough that
mathematical structures are coherent or consistent, these must have a much more
tangible reference to reality. Therefore any mathematical model not necessarily
is appropriate in physics. So, what sense has the concept of a point in
physics, that elementary notion used to represent the objects of the reality.
  If we consider that in a good model of reality, the existence of a
mathematical object with a physical reference must be equivalent to the
possibility of its construction, perception and verification of physical
existence, where the refutaction of the non-existence of an object does not
necessarily mean that it is possible to find a test of its existence. Then, one
obtains that the mathematical language becomes richer in structures, where the
point concept is replaced by more intuitive and perceivable concepts. On the
one hand, this possibly can lead us to a physics without infinites, and without
paradoxes, on the other hand, one restricts the use of mathematics and the use

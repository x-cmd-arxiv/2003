cosmological minihalos overtaken by the ionization fronts which swept through
the IGM during reionization in a LCDM universe, including the effects of
radiative transfer. We demonstrate the phenomenon of I-front trapping inside
minihalos, in which the weak, R-type fronts which traveled supersonically
across the IGM decelerated when they encountered the dense, neutral gas inside
minihalos, becoming D-type I-fronts, preceded by shock waves. For a minihalo
with virial temperature T_vir < 10^4 K, the I-front gradually burned its way
through the minihalo which trapped it, removing all of its baryonic gas by
causing a supersonic, evaporative wind to blow backwards into the IGM, away
from the exposed layers of minihalo gas just behind the advancing I-front. Such
hitherto neglected feedback effects were widespread during reionization. N-body
simulations and analytical estimates of halo formation suggest that sub-kpc
minihalos such as these, with T_vir < 10^4 K, were so common as to cover the
sky around larger-mass source halos and possibly dominate the absorption of
ionizing photons. This means that previous estimates of the number of ionizing
photons per H atom required to complete reionization which neglected this
effect may be too low. Regardless of their effect on the progress of
reionization, however, the minihalos were so abundant that random lines of
sight thru the high-z universe should encounter many of them, which suggests
that it may be possible to observe the processes described here in the
absorption spectra of distant sources.

success: the mu* model of Owen and Scalapino and the T* model of Parker.
Predictions depend on pairing symmetry. For instance, the gap suppression due
to excess quasiparticle density n in the mu* model, varies as n^{3/2} in d-wave
as opposed to n for s-wave. Finally, we consider these models in the context of
S-I-N tunneling and optical excitation experiments. While we confirm that
recent pump/probe experiments in YBCO, as presently interpreted, are in
conflict with d-wave pairing, we refute the further claim that they agree with
s-wave.

constraints on the neutrino decay models. Because of the long distance scale
from cosmological supernovae to the Earth, SRN have possibility to provide much
stronger limit than the present one obtained from solar neutrino observation.
Since the currently available data are only the upper limit on the flux
integrated over $E_{\bar\nu_e}>19.3$ MeV, the decay models on which we can set
constraints is quite restricted; they must satisfy specific conditions such
that the daughter neutrinos are active species, the neutrino mass spectrum is
quasi-degenerate, and the neutrino mass hierarchy is normal. Our numerical
calculation clearly indicates that the neutrino decay model with
$(\tau_2/m,\tau_3/m)\alt (10^{10},10^{10})$ [s/eV], where $\tau_i$ represents
the lifetime of mass eigenstates $\bar\nu_i$, appears to give the SRN flux that
is larger than the current upper limit. However, since the theoretical SRN
prediction contains many uncertainties concerning a supernova rate in the
universe or simulation of supernova explosions, we cannot conclude that there
exists the excluded parameter region of the neutrino lifetime. In the near
future, further reduced upper limit is actually expected, and it will provide
more severe constraints on the neutrino decay models.

  global color symmetry model of QCD","18 pages, 3 figures","Nucl.Phys. A725 (2003) 127-138","10.1016/S0375-9474(03)01574-4",,"nucl-th",,"  With the global color symmetry model (GCM) at finite chemical potential, the
density dependence of the bag constant, the total energy and the radius of a
nucleon in nuclear matter is investigated. A relation between the nuclear
matter density and the chemical potential with the action of QCD being taken
into account is obtained. A maximal nuclear matter density for the existence of
the bag with three quarks confined within is given. The calculated results
indicate that, before the maximal density is reached, the bag constant and the
total energy of a nucleon decrease, and the radius of a nucleon increases
slowly, with the increasing of the nuclear matter density. As the maximal
nuclear matter density is reached, the mass of the nucleon vanishes and the
radius becomes infinite suddenly. It manifests that a phase transition from
nucleons to quarks takes place.

when the soliton is perturbed by amplifier noise. In additional to that from
amplitude jitter, the nonlinear phase noise due to frequency and timing jitter
is also analyzed. Because the nonlinear phase noise is not Gaussian
distributed, the overall phase jitter is also non-Gaussian. For a fixed mean
nonlinear phase shift, the contribution of nonlinear phase noise from frequency
and timing jitter decreases with distance and signal-to-noise ratio.

show that for a given past the trajectory representation does not permit some
presents while the Copenhagen predicts a finite probability for these presents
to exist. This suggests another gedanken experiment to invalidate either
Copenhagen or the trajectory representation.

equivalent to the ability to send a classical message with a unitary or
isometric operation, and use it to relate other resources in quantum
information theory. Using coherent communication, we are able to generalize
super-dense coding to prepare arbitrary quantum states instead of only
classical messages. We also derive single-letter formulae for the classical and
quantum capacities of a bipartite unitary gate assisted by an arbitrary fixed
amount of entanglement per use.

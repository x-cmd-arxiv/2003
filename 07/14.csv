within virialized halos, using a statistical sample of halos drawn from
cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. Three simulations have been analyzed,
one is the ``non-radiative'' simulation, and the other two have radiative
cooling. We find that the gas component on average has a larger spin and
contains a smaller fraction of mass with negative angular momentum than its
dark matter counterpart in the non-radiative model. As to the cooling models,
the gas component shares approximately the same spin parameter as its dark
matter counterpart, but the hot gas has a higher spin and is more aligned in
angular momentum than dark matter, while the opposite holds for the cold gas.
After the mass of negative angular momentum is excluded, the angular momentum
profile of the hot gas component approximately follows the universal function
originally proposed by Bullock et al. for dark matter, though the shape
parameter $\mu$ is much larger for hot gas and is comfortably in the range
required by observations of disk galaxies. Since disk formation is related to
the distribution of hot gas that will cool, our study may explain the fact that
the disk component of observed galaxies contains a smaller fraction of low
angular momentum material than dark matter in halos.

near the Galactic center have been performed with a parallelized tree code.
Gerhard (2001) has suggested that dynamical friction, which causes a cluster to
lose orbital energy and spiral in towards the galactic center, may explain the
presence of a cluster of very young stars in the central parsec, where star
formation might be prohibitively difficult owing to strong tidal forces. The
clusters modeled in our simulations have an initial total mass of 10^5-10^6
Msun and initial galactocentric radii of 2.5-30 pc. We have identified a few
simulations in which dynamical friction indeed brings a cluster to the central
parsec, although this is only possible if the cluster is either very massive
(~10^6 Msun), or is formed near the central parsec (<~ 5 pc). In both cases,
the cluster should have an initially very dense core (> 10^6 Msun pc-3). The
initial core collapse and segregation of massive stars into the cluster core,
which typically happens on a much shorter time scale than that characterizing
the dynamical inspiral of the cluster toward the Galactic center, can provide
the requisite high density. Furthermore, because it is the cluster core which
is most likely to survive the cluster disintegration during its journey
inwards, this can help account for the observed distribution of presumably
massive HeI stars in the central parsec.

effects of the magnetic coupling, the conductivity regime of the fluid and the
strength of the magnetic field, which is initially vertical. The conductivity
is treated as a tensor and assumed constant with height. We obtained solutions
for the structure and growth rate of global unstable modes for different
conductivity regimes, strengths of the initial magnetic field and coupling
between ionised and neutral components of the fluid. The envelopes of
short-wavelenght perturbations are determined by the action of competing local
growth rates at different heights, driven by the vertical stratification of the
disc. Ambipolar diffusion perturbations peak consistently higher above the
midplane than modes including Hall conductivity. For weak coupling,
perturbations including the Hall effect grow faster and act over a more
extended cross-section of the disc than those obtained using the ambipolar
diffusion approximation. Finally, we derived an approximate criterion for when
Hall diffusion determines the growth of the magnetorotational instability. This
is satisfied over a wide range of radii in protostellar discs, reducing the
extent of the magnetic `dead zone'. Even if the magnetic coupling is weak,
significant accretion may occur close to the midplane, rather than in the
surface regions of weakly-ionised discs.

Galaxies from the flux-limited SDSS with z\leq z_{max} and fewer than three

This criterion implies a density contrast \delta \rho/ \rho < -0.6 around void

z\leq z_{max}, from which we identify 1,010 galaxies as void galaxies. To

Updated Zwicky Catalog and the Southern Sky Redshift Survey with z_{max}=0.025

Void galaxies are significantly bluer than galaxies lying at higher density.
The population of void galaxies with M_r ~ M* +1 and brighter is on average
bluer and more concentrated (later type) than galaxies outside of voids. The
latter behavior is only partly explained by the paucity of luminous red

indicate that void galaxies should be relatively bluer, more disklike, and have
higher specific star formation rates.

D^{**} \pi(\rho), D^{**}\bar D_s^{(*)}, \bar D^{**}_sD^{(*)}$ and $\bar B_s\to
D_s^{**}\pi(\rho)$, where $D^{**}$ denotes generically a p-wave charmed meson.
The $B\to D^{**}$ transition form factors are studied in the improved version
of the Isgur-Scora-Grinstein-Wise quark model. We apply heavy quark effective
theory and chiral symmetry to study the strong decays of p-wave charmed mesons
and determine the magnitude of the $D_1^{1/2}-D_1^{3/2}$ mixing angle. Except
the decay to $D_1(2427)^0\pi^-$ the predictions for $B^-\to D^{**0}\pi^-$ agree
with experiment. The sign of $D_1^{1/2}-D_1^{3/2}$ mixing angle is found to be
positive in order to avoid a severe suppression on the production of
$D_1(2427)^0\pi^-$. The interference between color-allowed and color-suppressed
tree amplitudes is expected to be destructive in the decay $B^-\to
D_1(2427)^0\pi^-$. Hence, an observation of the ratio
$D_1(2427)^0\pi^-/D_1(2427)^+\pi^-$ can be used to test the relative signs of
various form factors as implied by heavy quark symmetry. Although the predicted
$B^-\to D_1(2420)^0\rho^-$ at the level of $3\times 10^{-3}$ exceeds the
present upper limit, it leads to the ratio
$D_1(2420)\rho^-/D_1(2420)\pi^-\approx 2.6$ as expected from the factorization
approach and from the ratio $f_\rho/f_\pi\approx 1.6$ . Therefore, it is
crucial to have a measurement of this mode to test the factorization
hypothesis. For $\bar B\to \bar D_s^{**}D$ decays, it is expected that $\bar
D_{s0}^*D\gsim \bar D_{s1}D$ as the decay constants of the multiplet
$(D_{s0}^*,D_{s1})$ become the same in the heavy quark limit.

Furthermore, we systematically study in which measurements and where in the
parameter space matter density uncertainties are most relevant. We illustrate
this discussion with examples that show the effects as functions of different
magnitudes of the matter density uncertainties. We find that matter density
uncertainties are especially relevant for large $\stheta \gtrsim 10^{-3}$.
Within the KamLAND-allowed range, they are most relevant for the precision
measurements of $\stheta$ and $\deltacp$, but less relevant for ``binary''
measurements, such as for the sign of $\ldm$, the sensitivity to $\stheta$, or
the sensitivity to maximal CP violation. In addition, we demonstrate that

  Communications of Physical Review D","Phys.Rev. D68 (2003) 061503","10.1103/PhysRevD.68.061503",,"hep-th astro-ph gr-qc hep-ph",,"  We study the late-time tails appearing in the propagation of massless fields
(scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational) in the vicinities of a
D-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. We find that at late times the fields
always exhibit a power-law falloff, but the power-law is highly sensitive to
the dimensionality of the spacetime. Accordingly, for odd D>3 we find that the
field behaves as t^[-(2l+D-2)] at late times, where l is the angular index
determining the angular dependence of the field. This behavior is entirely due
to D being odd, it does not depend on the presence of a black hole in the
spacetime. Indeed this tails is already present in the flat space Green's
function. On the other hand, for even D>4 the field decays as t^[-(2l+3D-8)],
and this time there is no contribution from the flat background. This power-law
is entirely due to the presence of the black hole. The D=4 case is special and
exhibits, as is well known, the t^[-(2l+3)] behavior. In the extra dimensional
scenario for our Universe, our results are strictly correct if the extra
dimensions are infinite, but also give a good description of the late time
behaviour of any field if the large extra dimensions are large enough.

Opt. 50 (2003) 1757","10.1080/09500340308235521","IENGF april 2002","quant-ph",,"  We present a first experimental test of the existence of Spontaneus
Parametric Up Conversion, predicted by a specific local realistic model based
on Wigner function formalism. The measurement has been made using a ccd camera
on the emission of a LiIO3 crystal pumped by a 351 nm and/or a 789 (1064) nm
lasers.
  We obtain an upper limit of 160 times on the ratio between intensity of
Spontaneus Parametric Up Conversion and Spontaneous Parametric Down conversion.

protocols for quantum authentication of $m$-length clas sical messages. The
message is encoded using a classical linear algebraic code $C[n,m,t]$. We
assume that Alice and Bob share a classical secret key, $x_{AB}$, of $n$ bits.
Alice creates $n$ qubits based on the code word and the key, that indicates the
bases used to create each qubit. The quantum states are sent to Bob through a
noiseless quantum channel. We calculate the failure probability of the protocol
considering several types of attacks.

  ApJ","Astrophys.J.598:848-857,2003","10.1086/379067",,"astro-ph",,"  We use the latest observations from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey to fit the
conditional luminosity function (CLF) formulation of the halo-model for
galaxies at z=0. This fit is then used to test the extent of evolution in the
halo occupation distribution (HOD) to z=0.8, by comparing the predicted
clustering from this CLF to preliminary results from the DEEP2 Redshift Survey.
We show that the current observations from the DEEP2 Redshift Survey are
remarkably consistent with no evolution in the CLF from z=0 to z=0.8. This
result is surprising, in that it suggests that there has been very little
change in the way galaxies occupy their host dark matter halos over half the
age of the Universe. We discuss in detail the observational constraints we have
adopted and also the various different selection effects in each survey and how
these impact on the galaxy populations encountered in each survey.

expected from the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect at large angles (\theta >

The detected correlation at low-z is in good agreement with a previous analysis
using the APM survey (z~0.15). The combined analysis of all 3 samples yields a
total significance better than 3 sigma for ISW and about 2.7 \sigma for SZ,

depends both on the value of \Omega_\Lambda and the galaxy bias b. To break
this degeneracy, we estimate the bias using the ratio between the galaxy and

identified. Their Log[N]-Log[Fp] distribution approximates a -3/2 power-law,
suggesting homogeneity and relatively nearby sources. These mostly dim bursts
account for ~ 50% of the BATSE sample of long bursts near that instrument's
trigger threshold, suggesting that this subluminous class constitutes a more
common variety than the more familiar burst sources which lie at truly
cosmological distances. Theoretical scenarios predicted such a class, motivated
by their exemplar GRB 980425 (SN 1998bw) lying at a distance of ~ 38 Mpc. The
observations are explained by invoking off-axis viewing of the GRB jet and/or
bulk Lorentz factors of order a few. Long-lag bursts show a tendency to
concentrate near the Supergalactic Plane with a quadrupole moment of
-0.10+/-0.04, similar to that for SNe type Ib/c within the same volume. The
rate of the observed subluminous bursts is of order 1/4 that of SNe Ib/c.
Evidence for a sequential relationship between SNe Ib/c and GRBs is critiqued
for two cases, as simultaneity of the SN and GRB events may be important for
detection of the expected gravitational wave signal; at most, SN to GRB delays
appear to be a few days. SN asymmetries and ultrarelativistic GRB jets suggest
the possibility of rapid rotation in the pre-collapse objects, a primary
condition required for highly non-axisymmetric SN collapse to produce strong
gravitational waves.

have a correlation length a factor of about 2 less than powerful radio galaxies

be ``unified'' by postulating that their main difference is due to their
evolution being at a different stage. It seems much more likely that these QSOs
are predominantly located in field galaxies, while the powerful radio sources
are located preferentially in early types. Furthermore, it appears that both
the extremely red objects (EROs) from the IR surveys and the more luminous
radio sources are similarly clustered and as such are the most clustered
objects known in the z>1 Universe. Even at z ~3 the red J-K galaxies from the
FIRES survey are similarly strongly clustered, at a level of about 3 times
higher than Lyman break galaxies. These clustering properties are consistent
with EROs and radio galaxies being similar objects at different stages of their
evolution. Locally, the most clustered population of objects are clusters of
galaxies. Since the progenitors of these objects -- proto-clusters -- will
therefore also be highly clustered, a good way to locate proto-clusters is to
target fields with very powerful and potentially highly clustered distant z>2

which QSO sources dominate the contribution to the UV background. To estimate
their contribution, we use the QSO luminosity functions from the 2dF and Sloan
QSO surveys. We estimate self-consistent values for the attenuation length at
the Lyman edge through the Intergalactic Medium using Particle Mesh simulations
of the LyA forest, normalised by the measured mean LyA flux. We examine the
convergence properties of the flux power spectrum and auto-correlation function
under differing assumptions regarding pressure-smoothing. Convergence to better
than 10% in the flux power spectrum at proper wavenumbers k < 0.015s/km
requires a comoving resolution of 30-60kpc/h in a comoving box of size 25Mpc/h
at z = 5, with the requirements becoming more severe at lower redshifts. We
find much better covergence properties for the relative effects of the UV
background fluctuations on the flux power spectrum. The background fluctuations
increase the large-scale power and suppress the power at intermediate scales.
At z < 4, the effect is only at the few percent level. By z > 5, however, the
large-scale power is boosted by more than 50%, suggesting the flux power
spectrum may serve as a useful tool for distinguishing QSO-dominated UV
background scenarios from those dominated by galaxies.

contributions which contribute most of the induced CMB polarisation in addition
to the intrinsic CMB quadrupole: the radiation quadrupole seen by electrons due
to their own velocity in the plane normal to the line of sight, and the
radiation quadrupole due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, which is
generated by a previous scattering elsewhere in the cores of the local and
nearby clusters. We show that inside the virial radius of a massive cluster,
this latter effect, although being second order in the optical depth, can reach
the level of the former effect. These two effects can, respectively, constrain
the projected tangential velocity and inner density profile of the gas, if they
can be separated with multi-frequency observations. As the information on the
tangential velocity of the ICM gas is combined with the kinetic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich temperature effect probing the projected radial velocity it
will be possible to constrain the dynamics of the ICM. In particular, future
polarisation observations may be able to trace out the filamentary structure of
the cooler and less dense ionized gas that has not yet been incorporated into

limits. Using 87 galaxies with reliable Chandra data, X-ray emission is
detected for galaxies down to M_B ~ -19.0, with only an upper limit determined
for galaxies at M_B ~ -18.3. The ratio of X-ray to optical luminosities is
consistent with recent determinations of the low-mass X-ray binary content of
nearby elliptical galaxies. Taken individually, in contrast, we detect
significant (3sigma) flux for only six galaxies. Of these, one is a foreground
galaxy, while two are optically-faint galaxies with X-ray hardness ratios
characteristic of active galactic nuclei. The remaining three detected galaxies
are amongst the optically-brightest cluster members, and have softer X-ray
spectra. Their X-ray flux is higher than that expected from X-ray binaries, by
a factor 2-10; the excess suggests these galaxies have retained their hot
gaseous haloes. The source with the highest L_X / L_B ratio is of unusual
optical morphology with prominent sharp-edged shells. Notwithstanding these few
exceptions, the cluster population overall exhibits X-ray properties consistent
with their emission being dominated by X-ray binaries. We conclude that in rich

strip most galaxies of their hot halo gas.

correlation exists in the (Mv, log L) plane (L is the absolute flux in the
line). In this plane, normal and RS CVn stars are distributed along two nearly
parallel straight lines with RS CVn stars being systematically brighter by
about 1 dex. Such a diagram provides an interesting tool to discriminate active
from normal stars. We finally analyse the distribution of RS CVn and of normal

results from the combination of the nonmonotonic dependence of Tc on hole
doping or hole-doping distribution among inequivalent layers, and from an
``intrinsic'' contribution. After reviewing our work on the interplay among Tc,
hole content, and pressure in the bilayered and multilayered cuprate
superconductors, we will discuss how the proximity to an electronic topological
transition (ETT) may give a microscopic justification of the ``intrinsic''
pressure dependence of Tc in the cuprates. As a function of the proximity to an
ETT, we recover a nonmonotonic behaviour of the superconducting gap at T=0,
regardless of the pairing symmetry of the order parameter. This is in agreement
with the trend observed for Tc as a function of pressure and other material
specific quantities in several high-Tc cuprates. In the case of epitaxially
strained cuprate thin films, we argue that an ETT can be driven by a
strain-induced modification of the in-plane band structure, at constant hole
content, at variance with a doping-induced ETT, as is usually assumed. We also
find that an increase of the in-plane anisotropy enhances the effect of
fluctuations above Tc on the normal-state transport properties, which is a
fingerprint of quantum criticality at T=0.

regime. As in previous analyses, the resummed exponents are reduced to
phenomenologically interesting values. Furthermore, significant preasymptotic

from the DGLAP result in the moderate small-x region, showing a shallow dip
followed by the expected power increase in the very small-x region. Finally, we
outline the extension of the resummation procedure to include the photon impact
factors.

version). Gravity is described in this approach not by one Riemannian metric
(i.e. a symmetric two-tensor field) but by a multiplet of such fields, or by a
matrix-valued symmetric two-tensor field that satisfies certain conditions. We
define the matrix extensions of standard constructions of differential geometry
including connections and curvatures, and finally, an invariant functional of
the new field that reduces to the standard Einstein action functional in the
commutative (diagonal) case. Our main idea is the analogy with Yang-Mills
theory (QCD and Standard Model). We call the new degrees of freedom of gravity
associated with the matrix structure `gravitational color' or simply
`gravicolor' and introduce a new gauge symmetry associated with this degree of
freedom. As in the Standard Model there are two possibilities. First of all, it
is possible that at high energies (say at Planckian scale) this symmetry is
exact (symmetric phase), but at low energies it is badly broken, so that one
tensor field remains massless (and gives general relativity) and the other ones
become massive with the masses of Planckian scale. Second possibilty is that
the additional degrees of freedom of gravitational field are confined within
the Planckian scale. What one sees at large distances are singlets (invariants)

$d$-dimensional Lorentz gas, with fixed, hard sphere scatterers. To evaluate
this propagator in the semi-classical region, and for times less than the
Ehrenfest time, we express its effect on an initial Gaussian wave packet in
terms of quantities analogous to those used to describe the exponential
separation of trajectories in the classical version of this system. This result
relates the spread of the wave packet to the rate of separation of classical
trajectories, characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents. We consider
applications of these results, first to illustrate the behavior of the
wave-packet auto-correlation functions for wave packets on periodic orbits. The
auto-correlation function can be related to the fidelity, or Loschmidt echo,
for the special case that the perturbation is a small change in the mass of the
particle. An exact expression for the fidelity, appropriate for this
perturbation, leads to an analytical result valid over very long time
intervals, inversely proportional to the size of the mass perturbation. For
such perturbations, we then calculate the long-time echo for semi-classical
wave packets on periodic orbits. This paper also corrects an earlier
calculation for a quantum echo, included in a previous version of this paper.
We explain the reasons for this correction.

NLSI corresponds to the zero range limit of the standard cubic and quartic
self-interactions of the scalar field. The method to treat the NLSI uses the
Fierz transformation, which enables one to express the exchange (Fock)
components in terms of the direct (Hartree) ones. The method is applied to
nuclear matter and finite nuclei. It is shown that, in the RHF formalism, the
NLSI, which are explicitly isovector-independent, generate scalar, vector and
tensor nucleon self-energies strongly density-dependent. This strong isovector
structure of the self-energies is due to the exchange terms of the RHF method.
Calculations are carried out with a parametrization containing five free
parameters. The model allows a description of both types of systems compatible

interacting with a two-level atom, is simultaneously submitted to linear and

fields in the achievement of real mesoscopic states, is to produce
highly-squeezed field states and, consequently, to increase both: i) the
distance in phase space between the components of the prepared superpositions
and ii) the mean photon number of such superpositions. When submitting the
squeezed superposition states to the action of similarly squeezed reservoirs,
we demonstrate that under specific conditions the decoherence time of the
states becomes independent of both the distance in phase space between their
components and their mean photon number. An explanation is presented to support
this remarkable result, together with a discussion on the experimental
implementation of our proposal. We also show how to produce number states with

using only linear optics elements and single photon detectors. We furthermore
generalize the scheme for producing any GHZ-like state of $n$ photons. The
input state of the scheme consists of a non-entangled state of $n$ photons.
Experimental aspects regarding the implementation of the scheme are presented.
Finally, the role of such schemes in quantum information processing with
photons is discussed.

the Schr\""odinger equation can be obtained if one can find a unit vector that
satisfies the equation obeyed by the mean of the spin operator. There exist at
least $2s+1$ cyclic solutions in any time interval. Some particular time
interval may exist in which all solutions are cyclic. The nonadiabatic
geometric phase for cyclic solutions generally contains extra terms in addition
to the familiar one that is proportional to the solid angle subtended by the
closed trace of the spin vector.

which the sender knows the quantum state to be communicated. The original paper
introducing teleportation established minimal requirements for classical
communication and entanglement but the corresponding limits for remote state
preparation have remained unknown until now: previous work has shown, however,
that it not only requires less classical communication but also gives rise to a
trade-off between these two resources in the appropriate setting. We discuss
this problem from first principles, including the various choices one may
follow in the definitions of the actual resources. Our main result is a general
method of remote state preparation for arbitrary states of many qubits, at a
cost of 1 bit of classical communication and 1 bit of entanglement per qubit
sent. In this ""universal"" formulation, these ebit and cbit requirements are
shown to be simultaneously optimal by exhibiting a dichotomy. Our protocol then
yields the exact trade-off curve for arbitrary ensembles of pure states and
pure entangled states (including the case of incomplete knowledge of the
ensemble probabilities), based on the recently established quantum-classical
trade-off for quantum data compression. The paper includes an extensive
discussion of our results, including the impact of the choice of model on the
resources, the topic of obliviousness, and an application to private quantum
channels and quantum data hiding.

mechanics to allow for dramatic increases in computational efficiency.
rf-SQUIDs show potential for quantum computing applications by forming the
qubit component of a quantum computer, through simply treating the direction of
current - clockwise or counterclockwise - as the value of the bit. rf-SQUIDs
present a major advantage over atomic-scale qubit systems - they are sensitive
to parameters that can be engineered. Flux qubits are linked through controlled
inductive coupling: the magnetic field of each junction affects the others. The
strength of this coupling can be 'tuned,' allowing for refined control over the
behaviour of the system. rf-SQUIDs can also be mass produced on-chip, making
large-scale production feasible.

to dynamical perturbations from other stars in the system. These perturbations
will strip outer planets, forming a population of free-floating planets, some
of which will be tidally captured before they evaporate from the system. For
systems with velocity dispersion of 1 km/s, Jupiter-mass planets can be
captured into orbits with periods of 0.1-0.4 days, which are generally stable
over a Gyr, assuming quadratic suppression of eddy viscosity in the convective
zones of the host stars. Under this assumption, and that most stars form
several massive planets at separations 5-50 AU, about 0.03% of stars in rich,
mature open clusters should have extremely close-in tidally captured planets.
Approximately 0.005% of field stars should also have such planets, which may be
found in field searches for transiting planets. Detection of a population of
tidally-captured planets would indicate that most stars formed in stellar
clusters. In globular clusters, the fraction of stars with tidally-captured
planets rises to 0.1% -- in conflict with the null result of the transit search
in 47 Tuc. This implies that, if the quadratic prescription for viscosity
suppression is correct, planetary formation was inhibited in 47 Tuc: less than
one planet of Jupiter-mass or greater (bound or free-floating) formed per
cluster star. Less than half of the stars formed solar-system analogs. Brown
dwarfs can also be captured in tight orbits; the lack of such companions in 47
Tuc in turn implies an upper limit on the initial frequency of brown dwarfs in
this cluster. However, this upper limit is extremely sensitive to the highly
uncertain timescale for orbital decay, and thus it is difficult to draw robust
conclusions about the low-mass end of the mass function in 47 Tuc.

objects (MACHOs) towards the Andromeda galaxy (M31). The survey aims to exploit
the high inclination of the M31 disk, which causes an asymmetry in the spatial
distribution of M31 MACHOs. Here, we investigate the effects of halo velocity
anisotropy and flattening on the asymmetry signal using simple halo models. For
a spherically symmetric and isotropic halo, we find that the underlying
pixel-lensing rate in far-disk M31 MACHOs is more than 5 times the rate of
near-disk events. We find that the asymmetry is increased further by about 30%
if the MACHOs occupy radial orbits rather than tangential orbits, but is
substantially reduced if the MACHOs lie in a flattened halo. However, even for
haloes with a minor-to-major axis ratio q = 0.3, the numbers of M31 MACHOs in
the far-side outnumber those in the near-side by a factor of ~2. We show that,
if positional information is exploited in addition to number counts, then the
number of candidate events required to confirm asymmetry for a range of
flattened and anisotropic halo models is achievable, even with significant
contamination by variable stars and foreground microlensing events. For
pixel-lensing surveys which probe a representative portion of the M31 disk, a
sample of around 50 candidates is likely to be sufficient to detect asymmetry
within spherical haloes, even if half the sample is contaminated, or to detect
asymmetry in haloes as flat as q = 0.3 provided less than a third of the sample
comprises contaminants. We also argue that, provided its mass-to-light ratio is
less than 100, the recently observed stellar stream around M31 is not
problematic for the detection of asymmetry. (Abstract slightly abridged.)

relativistic jet with a uniform (in space and time) magnetic field and
synchrotron emission from a jet with a random magnetic field in the plane of
the shock. Somewhat surprisingly we find that both scenarios can produce a
comparable level of polarization ($\sim 45-50$% for the uniform field and $\sim
30-35$% for a random field). Uniform time independent field most naturally
arises by expansion of the field from the compact object. It requires a
$10^{12}$G field at the source and a transport of the field as $\propto
R^{-1}$. It {\it does not} imply Poynting flux domination of the energy of the
wind. There is a serious difficulty however, within this scenario, accounting
for particle acceleration (which requires random magnetic fields) both for
Poynting flux and non-Poynting flux domination. Significant polarization can
also arise from a random field provided that the observer is located within
$1/\Gamma$ orientation from a narrow ($\theta_j \sim 1/\Gamma$) jet. While most
jets are wider, the jet of GRB 021206 from which strong polarization was
recently observed, was most likely very narrow. GRB 021206 is among the
strongest bursts ever. Adopting the energy-angle relation we find an estimated
angle of $<1/40$rad or even smaller. Thus, for this particular burst the
required geometry is not unusual. We conclude that the RHESSI observations
suggest that the prompt emission results from synchrotron radiation. However,
in view of the comparable levels of polarizations predicted by both the random
field and the homogeneous field scenarios these observations are insufficient
to rule out or confirm either one.

into account the internal structure, mass function and accretion rate of

the dynamical effects of spiral arms and bars. We calibrate this model against
N-body simulations and demonstrate that it is able to reproduce the N-body
heating rates to within a factor of 3 in the majority of cases. Our model gives
the distribution of disk scale-heights for galaxies of different luminosities.
For L* spiral galaxies, it predicts a median disk thickness of only 5% of the
radial scale-length if substructure is the only source of heating. The median
disk thickness increases to nearly 20% of the radial scale-length when heating
due to gravitational scattering of stars by molecular clouds is also included.
The latter value is close to the thickness estimated observationally for the
disk of the Milky Way galaxy. The distribution of disk thickness predicted by
the model is also consistent with a recent observational determination for
sub-L* galaxies by Bizyaev & Mitronova. Thus, the observed thickness of the
stellar disks of spiral galaxies seems to be entirely compatible with the
abundance of substructure in dark matter halos predicted by the standard
Lambda-dominated cold dark matter model of structure formation. In an Omega_0=1
universe, our best model of galaxy formation produces similar scale-heights, a
consequence of the fact that similar amounts of substructure are accreted by
halos during the lifetime of the disk in Omega_0=1 and Omega_0=0.3,

that background galaxies selected with I=23-26 have a redshift distribution
statistically similar to that in the HDFs. Combining strong and weak

0.1 to 5 Mpc thus providing a valuable test of the universal form proposed by

distribution with 3D slope larger than 2.4. An isothermal mass profile is
therefore strongly rejected, whereas a NFW profile with M_200= 6.1+/-1 10^14

incorporating on-chip gain. They may be operated to give an effective readout
noise much less than one electron by implementing an on-chip gain process
allowing the detection of individual photons. However, the gain mechanism is
stochastic and so introduces significant extra noise into the system. In this
paper we examine how best to process the output signal from an L3CCD so as to
minimize the contribution of stochastic noise, while still maintaining
photometric accuracy.
  We achieve this by optimising a transfer function which translates the
digitised output signal levels from the L3CCD into a value approximating the
photon input as closely as possible by applying thresholding techniques. We
identify several thresholding strategies and quantify their impact on photon
counting accuracy and effective signal-to-noise.
  We find that it is possible to eliminate the noise introduced by the gain
process at the lowest light levels. Reduced improvements are achieved as the
light level increases up to about twenty photons per pixel and above this there
is negligible improvement. Operating L3CCDs at very high speeds will keep the
photon flux low, giving the best improvements in signal-to-noise ratio.

considered confirmed black holes. Their estimated masses are found to fall in
the range 3.5 to 16 solar masses. Finally, some general remarks concerning
relation of black hole candidates to different classes of X-ray binaries such
as X-ray Novae, microquasars and high/low mass X-ray binaries are presented.

universes. Conformal embedding of closed-universe models in a de Sitter
background suggests a quantisation condition on the available conformal time.
This condition implies that the universe is closed at no greater than the 10%
level. When a massive scalar field is introduced to drive an inflationary phase
this figure is reduced to closure at nearer the 1% level. In order to enforce
the constraint on the available conformal time we need to consider conditions
in the universe before the onset of inflation. A formal series around the
initial singularity is constructed, which rests on a pair of dimensionless,
scale-invariant parameters. For physically-acceptable models we find that both
parameters are of order unity, so no fine tuning is required, except in the
mass of the scalar field. For typical values of the input parameters we predict
the observed values of the cosmological parameters, including the magnitude of
the cosmological constant. The model produces a very good fit to the most
recent CMBR data. The primordial curvature spectrum predicts the low-l fall-off
in the CMB power spectrum observed by WMAP. The spectrum also predicts a
fall-off in the matter spectrum at high k, relative to a power law. A further
prediction of our model is a large tensor mode component, with r~0.2.

field may be locked to near zero mass for one family. This can suppress the
long-range scalar force in the dark sector and eliminate evolution of the
effective cosmological constant and the mass of the nonrelativistic dark matter
particles, making the model close to Lambda CDM, until the particle number
density becomes low enough to allow the scalar field to evolve. This is a
useful example of the possibility for complexity in the dark sector.

magnetization and the differential conductance, which are characteristic of the
Kondo effect out of equilibrium. By solving a quantum Boltzmann equation, we
determine the nonequilibrium magnetization on the dot and show that the
application of both a finite bias voltage and a magnetic field induces a novel
structure of logarithmic corrections not present in equilibrium. These
corrections lead to more pronounced features in the conductance, and their form
calls for a modification of the perturbative renormalization group.

the solution, each large colloid (macroion) attracts certain number of
oppositely charged small colloids ($Z$-ion) to form a complex. If the
concentration ratio of the two colloids is such that complexes are not strongly
charged, they condense in a macroscopic aggregate. As a result, the phase
diagram in a plane of concentrations of two colloids consists of an aggregation
domain sandwiched between two domains of stable solutions of complexes. The
aggregation domain has a central part of total aggregation and two wings
corresponding to partial aggregation. A quantitative theory of the phase

grows, but the relative size of the partial aggregation domains becomes much

50% doped perovskite manganites are described from the viewpoint of the
magnetic spin ordering. In these systems, the zigzag antiferromagnetic
ordering, combined with the double-exchange physics, effectively divides the
whole sample into the one-dimensional ferromagnetic zigzag chains and results
in the anisotropy of electronic properties. The electronic structure of one
such chain is described by an effective 3$\times$3 Hamiltonian in the basis of
Mn($3de_g$) orbitals. We treat this problem analytically and consider the
following properties: (i) the nearest-neighbor magnetic interactions; (ii) the
distribution of the Mn($3de_g$) and Mn($4p$) states near the Fermi level, and
their contribution to the optical conductivity and the resonant x-ray
scattering near the Mn $K$-absorption edge. We argue that the anisotropy of
magnetic interactions in the double-exchange limit, combined with the isotropic
superexchange interactions, readily explains both the local and the global
stability of the zigzag antiferromagnetic state. The two-fold degeneracy of
$e_g$ levels plays a very important role in the problem and explains the
insulating behavior of the zigzag chain, as well as the appearance of the
orbital ordering in the double-exchange model. Importantly, however, the charge
ordering itself is expected to play only a minor role and is incompatible with
the ferromagnetic coupling within the chain. We also discuss possible effects
of the Jahn-Teller distortion and compare the tight-binding picture with
results of band structure calculations in the local-spin-density approximation.

approximated by integrals. The approximation fails in small cavities or at very
low temperature, when the ratio $x$ between the energy quantum and thermal
energy is larger or equal to unity. In addition, the exact calculation, which
is based on number theoretical concepts, shows excess low frequency noise in
thermodynamical quantities, that the continuous approximation fails to predict.
It is first shown that Riemann zeta function is essentially the Mellin
transform of the partition function $Z(x)$ of the non degenerate (one
dimensional) perfect gas. Inverting the transform leads to the conventional
perfect gas law. The degeneracy has two aspects. One is related to the wave
nature of particles: this is accounted for from quantum statistics, when the de
Broglie wavelength exceeds the mean distance between particles. We emphasize
here the second aspect which is related to the degeneracy of energy levels. It
is given by the number of solutions $r_3(p)$ of the three squares diophantine
equation, a highly discontinuous arithmetical function. In the conventional
approach the density of states is proportional to the square root of energy,
that is $r_3(p)\simeq 2 \pi p^{1/2}$. We found that the exact density of states
relates to the class number in the quadratic field $Q(\sqrt{-p})$. One finds

``dressed-dressed'' interaction between two neutral objects, each an electron
surrounded by its full-coupling exchange-correlation hole. For the effective
interaction between two electrons of antiparallel spin in a high-density
uniform electron gas of arbitrary spin polarization, we confirm that this
picture is qualitatively correct. In contrast, the ``bare-dressed'' interaction
is too repulsive, and does not have the expected symmetry $V_{\ud}(r) =
V_{\du}(r)$. The simple original Overhauser model interaction, independent of
the relative spin polarization $\zeta$, does not capture the $\zeta$-dependence
of the correlation contribution to $g(r=0)$.

allowing the formulation of Wick's theorem for superoperators, giving a

Green's functions. Backward propagations and the analytic continuations using
artificial times (Keldysh loops and Matsubara contours) are avoided. A
generating functional for nonlinear response functions unifies quantum field

B(Y(1S) --> phi f2'(1525)) = (7 +3-2(stat) +-1(syst)) x 10**-6 and B(Y(1S) -->
K1(1400) Kbar) = (14 +4-3(stat) +-2(syst)) x 10**-6. Production of K1(1270)
Kbar in Y(1S) decay is suppressed relative to that of K1(1400) Kbar. These
results add another piece to the challenging ``rho-pi puzzle'' of the
charmonium system, placing constraints on models of how quantum chromodynamics
should be applied to heavy quarkonia. All results are preliminary.

the consideration of the non-forward amplitude, plus the systematic use of
boundary conditions that ensure that only a finite number of $j^P$ intermediate
states (with their tower of radial excitations) contribute. A study of these
sum rules shows that it is possible to bound the curvature $\sigma^2 =
\xi''(1)$ of the elastic Isgur-Wise function $\xi (w)$ in terms of its slope
$\rho^2 = - \xi '(1)$. Besides the bound $\sigma^2 \geq {5 \over 4} \rho^2$,
previously demonstrated, we find the better bound $\sigma^2 \geq {1 \over 5} [4
\rho^2 + 3(\rho^2)^2]$. We show that the quadratic term ${3 \over 5}
(\rho^2)^2$ has a transparent physical interpretation, as it is leading in a
non-relativistic expansion in the mass of the light quark. At the lowest
possible value for the slope $\rho^2 = {3 \over 4}$, both bounds imply the same
bound for the curvature, $\sigma^2 \geq {15 \over 16}$. We point out that these
results are consistent with the dispersive bounds, and, furthermore, that they
strongly reduce the allowed region by the latter for $\xi (w)$.

D3-brane playing the role of the boundary to this space. The motion of the
probe D3-brane in the bulk, induces a cosmological evolution on the brane. As
the brane crosses the horizon of the bulk black hole, it probes the holography
of the dual CFT. We test the holographic principle and we find corrections to
CFT/FRW relations in various physical cases: for radially moving, spinning and
electrically charged D3-brane and for a NS/NS B-field in the bulk.

objects. The effective quantum gravitational theory can lead to a modification
of Einstein's equations due to the lack of local Lorentz-symmetry. We explore
the generalized gravity with global instead of local Lorentz symmetry in first
order of a systematic derivative expansion. At this level diffeomorphisms and
global Lorentz symmetry allow for two new invariants in the gravitational
effective action. The one which arises in the one loop approximation to spinor
gravity is consistent with all present tests of general relativity and
cosmology. This shows that local Lorentz symmetry is tested only very partially
by present observations. In contrast, the second possible new coupling is
severely restricted by present solar system observations.

summatory functions $\sigma_k(n)$ of the power of divisors, with $k=-1$ for the
free energy, $k=0$ for the number of particles and $k=1$ for the internal
energy. Low frequency contributions are calculated using Mellin transform
methods. In particular the internal energy per mode diverges as
$\frac{\tilde{E}}{kT}=\frac{\pi^2}{6 x}$ with $x=\frac{h \nu}{kT}$ in contrast
to the Planck energy $\tilde{E}=kT$. The theory is applied to calculate
corrections in black body radiation and in the Debye solid. Fractional energy
fluctuations are found to show a $1/\nu$ power spectrum in the low frequency
range. A satisfactory model of frequency fluctuations in a quartz crystal

beads coated with polymerization enzymes spontaneously breaks the symmetry of
its spherical shape, and yields a ``comet'' pushing the bead forward. We
propose a mechano-chemical coupling mechanism for the initialization of this
symmetry breaking. Key assumptions are that the dissociation of the gel takes
place mostly in the region of the external surface, and that the rates of the
dissociation depends on the tensile stress in the gel. We analyze a simplified
two-dimensional model with a circular substrate. Our analysis shows that the
symmetric steady state is always unstable against the inhomogeneous modulation
of the thickness of the gel layer, for any radius of the circular substrate. We
argue that this model represents the essential feature of the three-dimensional
systems for a certain range of characteristic lengths of the modulation. The
characteristic time of the symmetry breaking process in our model depends
linearly on the radius of curvature of the substrate surface, which is
consistent with experimental results, using spherical latex beads as substrate.
Our analysis of the symmetry breaking phenomenon demonstrates aspects of
mechano-chemical couplings that should be working in vivo as well as in vitro.

construct LOCC data hiding schemes for bits and qubits that are much more

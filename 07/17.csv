(dimensionless) variable is here eta = [G m^2 N]/[V^{1/3} T] (which is kept
fixed in the thermodynamic limit). We succeed in this way to obtain the
expansion of the grand canonical partition function in powers of the fugacity.
The corresponding cluster coefficients behave in the thermodynamic limit as
[eta/N]^{j-1} c_j where c_j are pure numbers. They are expressed as integrals
associated to tree cluster diagrams. A bilinear recurrence relation for the
coefficients c_j is obtained from the mean field equations in the Abel form. In
this way the large j behaviour of the c_j is calculated. This large j behaviour
provides the position of the nearest singularity which corresponds to the
critical point (collapse) of the self-gravitating gas in the grand canonical
ensemble. Finally, we discuss why other attempts to define a thermodynamic
limit for the self-gravitating gas fail.

carry out numerical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of warped, viscous

develop into a highly warped steady state in which the disk attains a fixed

inner radius (near the magnetosphere boundary). As the system parameters (such
as accretion rate) change, the disk can switch between a completely flat state

be responsible for a variety of quasi-periodic oscillations or radiation flux

stellar-dynamical evolution of a massive black-hole binary at the center of a
spherical galaxy. We focus on the dependence of the hardening rate on the
relaxation timescale of the parent galaxy. A simple theoretical argument
predicts that a binary black hole creates the ``loss cone'' around it. Once the
loss cone is formed, the hardening rate is determined by the rate at which
field stars diffuse into the loss cone. Therefore the hardening timescale
becomes proportional to the relaxation timescale. Recent N-body simulations,
however, have failed to confirm this theory and various explanations have been
proposed. By performing simulations with sufficiently large N (up to $10^6$)
for sufficiently long time, we found that the hardening rate does depend on N.
Our result is consistent with the simple theoretical prediction that the
hardening timescale is proportional to the relaxation timescale. This
dependence implies that most massive black hole binaries are unlikely to merge
within the Hubble time through interaction with field stars and gravitational
wave radiation alone.

provides one of the most efficient methods to deduce regular magnetic fields
from radio astronomical observations. Since the Faraday rotation measure RM is
proportional to an integral, along the line of sight, of magnetic field
weighted with thermal electron density, RM is believed to yield the regular
magnetic field averaged over large volume. Here we show that this is not the
case in a turbulent medium where fluctuations in magnetic field and electron
density are not statistically independent, and so contribute to RM. For
example, in the case of pressure equilibrium, magnetic field can be
anticorrelated with plasma density to produce a negative contribution. As a
result, the strength of the regular magnetic field obtained from RM can be
underestimated if the fluctuations in electron density and magnetic field are
neglected. The anticorrelation also reduces the standard deviation of RM. We
further discuss the effect of the positive correlations where the standard
treatment of RM leads to an overestimated magnetic field. Because of the
anisotropy of the turbulent magnetic field, the regular magnetic fields
strength, obtained from synchrotron emission using standard formulae, can be
overestimated. A positive correlation between cosmic-ray number density and
magnetic field leads to an overestimate of the strengths of the regular and
total fields. These effects can explain the difference between the strengths of
the regular Galactic magnetic field as indicated by RM and synchrotron
emissivity data and reconcile the magnetic field strength in the Solar vicinity
with typical strength of regular magnetic fields in external galaxies.

star--forming galaxies at z>2 form stars with an average specific rate at least

implies that UV bright star--forming galaxies are substancial contributors to

spot size is several particle diameters, so cages of nearest neighbors tend to
remain intact over large distances. The spot hypothesis relates diffusion and
cage-breaking to volume fluctuations and spatial velocity correlations, in
agreement with new experimental data. It also predicts density waves caused by
weak spot interactions. Spots enable fast, multiscale simulations of dense
flows, in which a small, internal relaxation enforces packing constraints
during spot-induced motion. In the continuum limit of the model, tracer
diffusion is described by a new stochastic differential equation, where the
drift velocity and diffusion tensor are coupled non-locally to the spot
density. The same mathematical formalism may also find applications to glassy
relaxation, as a compelling alternative to void (or hole) random walks.

scaling properties. Below the transition, the traffic jam is macroscopic in the
sense that the length of the queue scales linearly with system size. Above the
transition, only a power-law shaped queue remains. Its density profile scales
as $\delta \rho\sim x^{-\nu}$ with $\nu={1/3}$, and $x$ is the distance from
the obstacle. We construct a heuristic argument, indicating that the exponent
$\nu={1/3}$ is universal and independent of the dynamic exponent of the
underlying dynamic process. Fast bonds create only power-law shaped depletion
queues, and with an exponent that could be equal to $\nu={2/3}$, but the
numerical results yield consistently somewhat smaller values $\nu\simeq
0.63(3)$. The implications of these results to faceting of growing interfaces
and localization of directed polymers in random media, both in the presence of
a columnar defect are pointed out as well.

agent updates by a single step random grouping in which all participants adopt

Here we show that the introduction of contrarians may give rise to interesting
dynamics generated phases and even to a critical behavior at a contrarian
concentration $a_c$. For $a<a_c$ an ordered phase is generated with a clear cut
majority-minority splitting. By contrast when $a>a_c$ the resulting disordered
phase has no majority: agents keep shifting opinions but no symmetry breaking
(i.e., the appearance of a majority) takes place. Our results are employed to
explain the outcome of the 2000 American presidential elections and that of the

On this basis the ``hung elections scenario'' is predicted to become a common

behavior of grains can be described through hydrodynamic equations accounting
for dissipation among the interacting particles. A basis for the derivation of
hydrodynamic equations and explicit expressions appearing in them is provided
by the Boltzmann kinetic theory conveniently modified to account for inelastic
binary collisions. The goal of this review is to derive the hydrodynamic
equations for a binary mixture of smooth inelastic hard spheres. A normal
solution to the Boltzmann equation is obtained via the Chapman-Enskog method
for states near the {\em local} homogeneous cooling state. The mass, heat, and
momentum fluxes are obtained to first order in the spatial gradients of the
hydrodynamic fields, and the set of transport coefficients are determined in
terms of the restitution coefficients and the ratios of mass, concentration,
and particle sizes. As an example of their application, the dispersion
relations for the hydrodynamic equations linearized about a homogeneous state
are obtained and the conditions for stability are identified as functions of
the wave vector, the dissipation, and the parameters of the mixture. The
analysis shows that the homogeneous reference state is unstable to long enough
wavelength perturbations and consequently becomes inhomogeneous for long times.
The relationship of this instability to the validity of hydrodynamics is
discussed.

constraints) coupled to two quasi-linear scalar wave equations. The remaining

equations. Difference equations then appear mainly as an approximation which
can be used for a numerical analysis. As such, they have to fulfill certain
conditions to ensure that the numerical solutions can reliably be used as
approximations to solutions of the differential equation. There are, however,
also systems where a difference equation is deemed to be fundamental, mainly in
the context of quantum gravity. Since difference equations in general are
harder to solve analytically than differential equations, it can be helpful to
introduce an approximating differential equation as a continuum approximation.
In this paper implications of this change in view point are analyzed to derive
the conditions that the difference equation should satisfy. The difference
equation in such a situation cannot be chosen freely but must be derived from a
fundamental theory. Thus, the conditions for a discrete formulation can be
translated into conditions for acceptable quantizations. In the main example,
loop quantum cosmology, we show that the conditions are restrictive and serve
as a selection criterion among possible quantization choices.

function of the vector current on the lattice in the Landau gauge and using
both Wilson-clover and overlap actions. In order to be able to identify lattice
artifacts and to reach large momenta we use a range of lattice spacings. The
lattice artifacts turn out to be exceedingly large in this study. We present a
new and very efficient method to eliminate the hypercubic (anisotropy)
artifacts based on a systematic expansion on hypercubic invariants which are
not SO(4) invariant. A simpler version of this method has been used in previous
works. This method is shown to be significantly more efficient than the popular
``democratic'' methods. It can of course be applied to the lattice simulations
of many other physical quantities. The analysis indicates a hierarchy in the
size of hypercubic artifacts: overlap larger than clover and propagator larger
than vertex function. This pleads for the combined study of propagators and
vertex functions via Ward identities.

geometric deformation of the O(3) sigma model, and give a new interpretation to
its ultra-violet limit by gluing together two copies of Witten's
two-dimensional black hole in the asymptotic region. We also provide some new
solutions that describe the renormalization group flow of negatively curved
spaces in different patches, which look like a cane in the infra-red region.
Finally, we revisit the transition of a flat cone C/Z_n to the plane, as
another special solution, and note that tachyon condensation in closed string
theory exhibits a hidden relation to the infinite dimensional algebra G(d/dt;1)
in the regime of gravity. Its exponential growth holds the key for the
construction of conserved currents and their systematic interpretation in
string theory, but they still remain unknown.

to a family of supersymmetric flux configurations which interpolates between
imaginary self-dual fluxes and fluxes similar to the Polchinski-Strassler kind.
For multiple M5-branes, the IIB configurations are related to fluxes for
twisted sector fields in orbifolds. The dual M5-brane picture also provides a
geometric interpretation for several properties of flux configurations (like
the supersymmetry conditions, their contribution to tadpoles, etc), and for
many non-trivial effects in the IIB side. Among the latter, the dielectric
effect for probe D3-branes is dual to the recombination of probe M5-branes with
background ones; also, a picture of a decay channel for non-supersymmetric
fluxes is suggested.

distance, correlation functions and the population sequence of each strategy.
When the three payoff parameters take nearly values each other, the complex
patterns mainly appear and as the difference of parameter values are enlarged,
some peculiar strategy trends to be dominant gradually. An interesting fact is
that the strongest strategy in the payoff do not necessarily dominate the
latice world. There are even the cases where the weakest strategy in the payof
dominate. Generally many cases have some period much shoter than the dimension
of the configuration space.

including regular one and two dimensional networks, scale free networks, small
world networks, tree networks, and random networks. For small coupling
strengths nodes show turbulent behavior but form phase synchronized clusters as
coupling increases. We identify two different ways of cluster formation,
self-organized clusters which have mostly intra-cluster couplings and driven
clusters which have mostly inter-cluster couplings. The synchronized clusters
may be of dominant self-organized type, dominant driven type or mixed type
depending on the type of network and the parameters of the dynamics. There are
some nodes of the floating type that show intermittent behaviour between
getting attached to some clusters and evolving independently. The residence
times of a floating node in a synchronized cluster show an exponential
distribution. We define different states of the coupled dynamics by considering
the number and type of synchronized clusters. For the local dynamics governed
by the logistic map we study the phase diagram in the plane of the coupling
constant ($\epsilon$) and the logistic map parameter ($\mu$). For large
coupling strengths and nonlinear coupling we find that the scale free networks
and the Caley tree networks lead to better cluster formation than the other
types of networks with the same average connectivity. For most of our study we
use the number of connections of the order of the number of nodes which allows
us to distinguish between the two mechanisms of cluster formation. As the
number of connections increases the number of nodes forming clusters and the
size of the clusters in general increase.

The effective Lagrangian is characterized by density dependent coupling
strengths, determined by chiral one- and two-pion exchange and by QCD sum rule
constraints for the large isoscalar nucleon self-energies that arise through
changes of the quark condensate and the quark density at finite baryon density.
This approach is tested in the analysis of the equations of state for symmetric
and asymmetric nuclear matter, and of bulk and single-nucleon properties of
finite nuclei. In comparison with purely phenomenological mean-field
approaches, the built-in QCD constraints and the explicit treatment of pion
exchange restrict the freedom in adjusting parameters and functional forms of
density dependent couplings. It is shown that chiral (two-pion exchange)
fluctuations play a prominent role for nuclear binding and saturation, whereas
strong scalar and vector fields of about equal magnitude and opposite sign,
induced by changes of the QCD vacuum in the presence of baryonic matter,
generate the large effective spin-orbit potential in finite nuclei.

scattering from atoms of several elements is caused primarily by shape
resonances corresponding to the formation of temporary negative ions. It is
shown that such cross sections are expressible analytically in terms of a
constant background added to a ""generalized Fano profile"" [Durand Ph, et al

cases (sodium, magnesium and mercury), a detailed consideration proves that
this representation is accurate in a fairly wide energy range. Moreover, the
related momentum transfer cross sections are tailor-made for studying ""elastic""
electron transport in terms of the two-term solution of the Boltzmann equation:
Not only are the resulting swarm transport coefficients adjustable to the
experimental values, but above all they are calculable very easily because the
unnormalized energy distribution is obtainable analytically. The ample saving
in computational effort is exploited in order to test the Wannier-Robson
""momentum-transfer approximation""; it is found that, in these cases of
resonance-dominated cross sections, the latter method can be so accurate that
it can be used to recover the momentum transfer cross section from experimental
data algebraically. In the margin, a model profile is presented that gives rise
to negative differential conductivity.

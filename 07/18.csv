NGC 6240. The 0.3-10 keV spectrum can be successfully modelled with: (i) three
collisionally ionized plasma components with temperatures of about 0.7, 1.4,
and 5.5 keV; (ii) a highly absorbed direct power-law component; and (iii) a
neutral Fe K_alpha and K_beta line. We detect a significant neutral column
density gradient which is correlated with the temperature of the three plasma
components. Combining the XMM-Newton spectral model with the high spatial
resolution Chandra image we find that the temperatures and the column densities
increase towards the center.
  With high significance, the Fe K line complex is resolved into three distinct
narrow lines: (i) the neutral Fe K_alpha line at 6.4 keV; (ii) an ionized line
at about 6.7 keV; and (iii) a higher ionized line at 7.0 keV (a blend of the Fe
XXVI and the Fe K_beta line). While the neutral Fe K line is most probably due
to reflection from optically thick material, the Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission
arises from the highest temperature ionized plasma component.
  We have compared the plasma parameters of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy
NGC 6240 with those found in the local starburst galaxy NGC 253. We find a
striking similarity in the plasma temperatures and column density gradients,
suggesting a similar underlying physical process at work in both galaxies.

built in accordance with the requirements of the Lunar Laser Ranging
observational accuracy. We extended this model to the spin-orbit couplings of
the terrestrial planets including Mercury; the updated model is called SONYR
(acronym of Spin-Orbit N-BodY Relativistic model). An accurate rotation of
Mercury has been then obtained. Moreover, the conception of the SONYR model is
suitable for analyzing the different families of hermean rotational librations.
We accurately identify the non-linear relations between the rotation of Mercury
and its dynamical figure (\cmr2, $C_{20}$, and $C_{22}$). Notably, for a
variation of 1% on the \cmr2 value, signatures in the $\phi$ hermean libration
in longitude as well as in the $\eta$ obliquity of the planet are respectively
0.45 arcseconds (as) and 2.4 milliarcseconds (mas). These determinations
provide new constraints on the internal structure of Mercury to be discussed

three possible environments: 1) white dwarfs orbiting a low-mass black hole; 2)
white dwarfs encountering a massive black hole in a dense globular cluster; and
3) white dwarfs passing a supermassive black hole in a dense galactic core. We
estimate the rate at which such events could occur out to a redshift of z = 1.
Event rates are estimated to be significantly less than the rate of normal Type
Ia supernovae for all three classes. Nevertheless, such events may be frequent
enough to warrant a search for this new class of supernova. We propose several

the spectral region that is examined and can be as high as 60 m/s at 5600 A and
as low as 7 m/s in the 5900 A region. RV measurements of individual spectral
lines can show even higher RV amplitudes. The acoustic cross-sections of the
atmosphere, i.e. the phase and amplitude of the pulsations, as a function of
optical depth is found for spectral lines of Ca, Cr, Fe, La, Ce, Gd, Er and Nd.
This analysis shows that pulsation phase is variable through the atmosphere and
that Nd III lines pulsate almost 180 degrees out-of-phase with those of Nd II
features and are formed significantly higher in the stellar atmosphere. This
conclusively establishes the presence of at least one radial node to the
pulsations in the upper stellar atmosphere. The histogram of pulsational phases
for all individual spectral feature shows a bi-modal Gaussian distribution with
17% of the lines having a pulsational phase approximatels 165 degrees
out-of-phase with most other spectral lines. This is also consistent with the
presence of a radial node in the stellar atmosphere. The accumulation of phase
due to a running wave component can explain the 165 degree phase difference as
well as the broader width (by a factor of two) of one of the Gaussian
components of the phase distribution.

two degrees of freedom, namely, band index, as characterized by angular
momentum, and orbit, as characterized by position or momentum. The band-index
state, obtained by tracing over the orbital degree of freedom, is found to be a
pure state, hence the band-index and orbital degrees of freedom are separated
in this state. We propose some basic ideas on spatially separating the electron
and the hole, so that the entanglement of band-indices, or angular momenta, is
between spatially separated electron and hole.

liquid, supports both gapless fermionic and bosonic quasiparticle excitations.
The RFL is accessed using a re-formulation of 2d electrons consisting of
fermionic quasiparticles and $hc/2e$ vortices interacting with a mutual
long-ranged statistical interaction. In the presence of a strong
vortex-antivortex (i.e. roton) hopping term, the RFL phase emerges as an exotic
yet eminently tractable new quantum ground state. The RFL phase exhibits a
``Bose surface'' of gapless roton excitations describing transverse current
fluctuations, has off-diagonal quasi-long-ranged order (ODQLRO) at zero
temperature (T=0), but is not superconducting, having zero superfluid density
and no Meissner effect. The electrical resistance {\it vanishes} as $T \to 0$
with a power of temperature (and frequency), $R(T) \sim T^\gamma$ (with $\gamma
>1$), independent of the impurity concentration. The RFL phase also has a full
Fermi surface of quasiparticle excitations just as in a Landau Fermi liquid.
Electrons can, however, scatter anomalously from rotonic ""current
fluctuations'' and ""superconducting fluctuations'', leading to ""hot"" and ""cold""
spots. Fermionic quasiparticles dominate the Hall electrical transport. We also
discuss instabilities of the RFL to a conventional Fermi liquid and a
superconductor. Precisely {\it at} the instability into the Fermi liquid state,
the exponent $\gamma =1$, so that $R(T) \sim T$. Upon entering the
superconducting state the anomalous quasiparticle scattering is strongly

given to the nature of the optical gap, the temperature scale responsible for
its destruction, and the consequent clear distinction between indirect and

standard thermodynamics. In this work we compute the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer
complexity of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model at the quenched level, by using
the BRST supersymmetry. We show that the complexity calculated at K steps of
replica symmetry breaking is strictly related to the static free energy at K+1
steps of replica symmetry breaking. The supersymmetry therefore provides a
prescription to obtain the complexity of the TAP states from the standard
static free energy, even in models which are solved by more than one step of
replica symmetry breaking. This recipe states that the complexity is given by
the Legendre transform of the static free energy, where the Legendre parameter
is the largest replica symmetry breaking point of the overlap matrix.

the global solar data further narrows down the allowed LMA region and splits it
into two allowed zones -- a low $\Delta m^2$ region (low-LMA) and high $\Delta
m^2$ region (high-LMA). We demonstrate through a projected analysis that with
an exposure of 3 kton-year (kTy) \kl can remove this ambiguity.

correspondence. As string quantization on general backgrounds with fluxes is
very difficult, one often uses the duality at the level of canonical fields of
supergravity and the corresponding half-BPS operators in SYM, since they both
belong to the shortest multiplets of the superconformal group SU(2,2|4). In
addition to half-BPS operators, there are others with non-renormalization
properties. One such class of operators is the quarter-BPS operators, which are
dual to threshold bound states of elementary supergravity excitations. Their
scaling dimension is also determined by their internal quantum numbers.
Extended superspace methods make it simple to identify and remove descendant
pieces from quarter-BPS candidates. We also compute three-point functions
involving quarter-BPS operators, and explain how their non-renormalization
translates into statements about the dual supergravity quantities. But we can
go beyond discussing protected operators. The GS superstring on AdS(5) x S(5)
can be quantized exactly in the limit where the AdS(5) radius R goes to
infinity and the R-charge J scales like R^2. BMN states are then dual to single
trace operators with certain phases inserted (BMN operators). BMN operators are
another natural generalization of half-BPS operators. The perturbative
expansion of scaling dimensions of BMN operators is in powers of gN/J^2.
Moreover, one can do perturbation theory around the infinite R, J ~ R^2 limit.
Both expansions have the same regime of validity in string theory and in SYM.
We calculate the first 1/R^2 and 1/J corrections, and find complete agreement
between the dual quantities.

Since the recollision time is locked to the tunneling ionization time which
occurs only within fraction of an optical cycle, the peaks in the D$^+$ kinetic
energy spectra provides a measure of the time when the recollision occurs. This
collision dynamics forms the basis of the molecular clock where the clock can
be read with attosecond precision, as first proposed by Corkum and coworkers.
By analyzing each of the elementary processes leading to the fragmentation

is responsible for the formation of gas pressure distribution in the
magnetosphere. Plasma pressure, in turn, determines - within the framework of a
given magnetic field model - the density of bulk currents in the magnetosphere.
With a knowledge of the bulk currents as a function of coordinates, we can
calculate the field-aligned currents as a divergence of bulk currents. On the
other hand, specifying the convection model is equivalent to specifying the
electric field model. Since within the approximation of equipotential field
lines the electric field is common to the magnetosphere and ionosphere, bulk
currents and field-aligned currents in the ionosphere can be formally
calculated subject to the condition that ionospheric conductivity is wholly
determined by electron precipitation from the magnetosphere. The precipitation
intensity is readily inferred from the same magnetospheric model. Thus we have
two systems of field-aligned currents. One system is calculated from the model
of plasma pressure distribution in the magnetosphere, and the other is inferred
from a given model of the electric field and the electroconductivity model
calculated from electron precipitation. This brings up the question: How can
these two systems of field-aligned currents be reconciled? From previous
studies it is known that magnetospheric convection ""adjusts itself"" to the
level of energy losses in the ionosphere. Based on this, an attempt can be made
to achieve a conjugation of the aforementioned two systems of field-aligned
currents. This paper is devoted to analyzing such an attempt.

This eliminates the need for synchronization and developing a tunable high

any jitter in the arrival time of the electron bunches. The concept is based on
the generation of optical radiation in a master oscillator-power FEL amplifier
(MOPA) configuration. X-ray radiation is generated in an X-ray undulator
inserted between the modulator and radiator sections of the optical MOPA
scheme. An attractive feature of the FEL amplifier scheme is the absence of any

first stage is a conventional soft X-ray SASE FEL. Its gain is controlled in
such a way that the maximum energy modulation of the electron beam at the exit
is about equal to the local energy spread, but still far away from saturation.
When the electron bunch passes through the dispersion section this energy
modulation leads to effective compression of the particles. Then the bunched
electron beam enters the tapered undulator and produces strong radiation in the
process of coherent deceleration. We demonstrate that a frequency doubler
scheme can be integrated into the SASE FEL at the TESLA Test Facility at DESY,
and will allow to reach 3 nm wavelength with GW-level of output peak power.
This would extend the operating range of the FEL into the so-called water

  in results, conjectures added","IEEE-Transactions on Information Theory 51 (2005), 2812-2835",,,"quant-ph math.ST stat.TH",,"  There exist numerous proofs of Bell's theorem, stating that quantum mechanics
is incompatible with local realistic theories of nature. Here we define the
strength of such nonlocality proofs in terms of the amount of evidence against
local realism provided by the corresponding experiments. This measure tells us
how many trials of the experiment we should perform in order to observe a
substantial violation of local realism. Statistical considerations show that
the amount of evidence should be measured by the Kullback-Leibler or relative
entropy divergence between the probability distributions over the measurement
outcomes that the respective theories predict. The statistical strength of a
nonlocality proof is thus determined by the experimental implementation of it
that maximizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence from experimental (quantum
mechanical) truth to the set of all possible local theories. An implementation
includes a specification with which probabilities the different measurement
settings are sampled, and hence the maximization is done over all such setting
distributions.
  We analyze two versions of Bell's nonlocality proof (his original proof and
an optimized version by Peres), and proofs by Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt,
Hardy, Mermin, and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger. We find that the GHZ proof is
at least four and a half times stronger than all other proofs, while of the
two-party proofs, the one of CHSH is the strongest.

one or more readings of the expectation value of an observable. The system is
assumed to be a finite dimensional quantum control system for which we can

We investigate to what extent, by an appropriate sequence of evolutions and
measurements, we can obtain information on the initial state of the system. We
present a system theoretic viewpoint of this problem in that we study the {\it
observability} of the system. In this context, we characterize the equivalence
classes of indistinguishable states and propose algorithms for state

error correction, multi-party quantum communication, and quantum computation
within the framework of the one-way quantum computer. We characterize and
quantify the genuine multi-particle entanglement of such graph states in terms
of the Schmidt measure, to which we provide upper and lower bounds in graph
theoretical terms. Several examples and classes of graphs will be discussed,
where these bounds coincide. These examples include trees, cluster states of

concatenated [7,1,3]-CSS code, and a graph associated with the quantum Fourier

stabilizer formalism. For graphs of up to seven vertices we provide complete
characterization modulo local unitary transformations and graph isomorphies.

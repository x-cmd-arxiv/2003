characterized by the local spatial density of galaxies, estimated from the
distance to the 5th nearest neighbour. Extensive simulations have been made to
estimate correction factors for the local density due to sample incompleteness.
We discriminate the galaxies in distinct spectral classes -- passive,
star-forming, and short starburst galaxies -- by the use of the equivalent
widths of [{\sc O ii}]$\lambda$3727 and H$\delta$. The frequency of galaxies of
different classes are then evaluated as a function of the environment. We show
that the fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases with increasing density,
whereas passive galaxies present the opposite behaviour. The fraction of short
starburst galaxies -- that suffered a starburst at $\sim$ 200 Myr ago -- do not
present strong environmental dependence. The fraction of this class of galaxies
is also approximately constant with galaxy luminosity, except for the faintest
bins in the sample, where their fraction seems to increase. We find that the
star-formation properties are affected in all range of densities present in our
sample (that excludes clusters), what supports the idea that star-formation in
galaxies is affected by the environment everywhere. We suggest that mechanisms
like tidal interactions, which act in all environments, do play a relevant role
on the star-formation in galaxies.

series: one may, for instance, wish to estimate what the power spectrum of the
combined data sets might have been, or one may wish to estimate the
significance of a particular peak that shows up in two or more power spectra.
Also, one may occasionally need to search for a complex of peaks in a single
power spectrum, such as a fundamental and one or more harmonics, or a
fundamental plus sidebands, etc. Visual inspection can be revealing, but it can
also be misleading. This leads one to look for one or more ways of forming
statistics, which readily lend themselves to significance estimation, from two
or more power spectra. The familiar chi-square statistic provides a convenient
mechanism for combining variables drawn from normal distributions, and one may
generalize the chi-square statistic to be any function of any number of
variables with arbitrary distributions. In dealing with power spectra, we are
interested mainly in exponential distributions. One well-known statistic,
formed from the sum of two or more variables with exponential distributions,
satisfies the gamma distribution. We show that a transformation of this
statistic has the convenient property that it has an exponential distribution.
We introduce two additional statistics formed from two or more variables with
exponential distributions. For certain investigations, we may wish to study the
minimum power (as a function of frequency) drawn from two or more power
spectra. In other investigations, it may be helpful to study the product of the
powers. We give numerical examples and an example drawn from our solar-neutrino

by means of a two-dimensional procedure that makes it possible for us to
compare the DE analysis to the results of a compression method. As done with
the compression method, we analyze two pairs of samples, one biotic and the
other a-biotic. Each pair consists of a target, the putative stromatolite
sample, and of its surrounding matrix. We use two different procedures,
referring to single colors and to a color combination, respectively. We apply
the DE method to both procedures and we find the same result, this being that
the scaling index of the time series stemming from the biotic target yields a
scaling index larger than the scaling indices of the other three curves. We
argue that the DE analysis confirms the results of the compression method.

generaltwo-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). In those textures the flavor changing
neutral currentsare naturally suppressed. Motivated by a phenomenologically
successful texturewith four texture zeros in the standard model, we propose a
predictive ansatz for the Yukawa coupling matrices with the same texture in the
general 2HDM. Compared with the six texture-zero based ansatz proposed by Cheng
and Sher, it is in a better agreement with the data of quark mixings and CP
violation. The four texture-zero based ansatz predicts a different hierarchy in
the Yukawa coupling matrix elements. As a consequence, in the lepton sector,
the related Yukawa couplings are less constrained by the experimental upper
bound of $\mu\to e\gamma$, which allows significantly larger predictions for
other processes. The contributions from neutral scalar interactions to the
lepton number violation decay modes $\ell\to \ell_{1}\ell_{2}\ell_{3}$ are
calculated in both ansatz. It is shown that the predictions from the four
texture-zero based ansatz could be two order of magnitude greater than that
from the six texture-zero based one. The branching ratio of $\mu\to 3e$ and
$\tau\to 3\mu$ can reach $7.5 \times 10^{-17}$ and $1.3\tiems 10^{-10}$
respectively. The predicted ratio of $Br(\mu\to 3e)/Br(\tau\to 3e)$ is also
larger and almost parameter independent. Those differences make the two ansatz
to be easily distinguished by the future experiments.

manifold of dimension n and let H^{1,1} denote the (1,1) part of its real
second cohomology. On this space, we have an degree n form given by cup
product. Let K denote the open cone of Kahler classes in H^{1,1}, and K_1 the
level set consisting of classes in K on which the n-form takes value one. This
is a Riemannian manifold, with tangent space at a given point being the
primitive classes of type (1,1), and metric defined via the Hodge Index
Theorem. In the Calabi-Yau case (and probably more generally), we conjecture
that K_1 has non-positive sectional curvatures. This would place new
restrictions on the possible location of the Kahler cone in cohomology, giving
potentially useful information as to which differentiable manifolds may support
Calabi-Yau structures. The conjecture is motivated by a Mirror Symmetry
argument in Section 1. This argument suggests that one should develop a mirror
version of the Weil-Petersson theory of complex moduli. The outline of such a
theory is described in Sections 2-4, and the conjecture is verified under
certain extra assumptions. In Section 5, we investigate in more detail the case
when X is a Kahler threefold with h^{1,1} = 3, where we only have one sectional
curvature on K_1 to consider. We prove a formula (5.1) relating this curvature
to the classical invariants of the ternary cubic form, and we discuss various

if charge transport also exist in DNA chains with different base pairs. In this
paper we address this problem in its simple case, an homogeneous chain except
for a single different base pair, what we call a base-pair inhomogeneity, and
its effect on charge transport. Radial polarons experience either reflection or
trapping. However, twist polarons are good candidates for charge transport
along real DNA. This transport is also very robust with respect to weak
parametric and diagonal disorder.

Brillouin Scattering in long scale-length plasmas is presented. The method is
based on a decomposition of the hydrodynamics variables in long- and
short-wavelength components. It makes it possible to describe the
self-consistent coupling between the plasma hydrodynamics, Stimulated Brillouin
Scattering, and the generation of harmonics of the excited ion acoustic wave
(IAW). This description is benchmarked numerically and proves to be reliable
even in the case of an undamped ion acoustic wave. The momentum transferred
from the electromagnetic waves to the plasma ions is found to induce a plasma
flow which modifies the resonant three wave coupling between the IAW and the
light waves. A novel picture of SBS arises, in which both IAW harmonics and
flow modification reduce the coherence of SBS by inducing local defects in the
density and velocity profiles. The spatial domains of Stimulated Brillouin
activity are separated by these defects and are consequently uncorrelated,
resulting in a broad and structured spectrum of the scattered light and in a
temporally chaotic reflectivity.

polarization optics can, under certain conditions, show sharp changes and
reversals as a function of wavelength, a phenomenon originating in the
occurrence of phase singularities, earlier observed in interference
experiments. It was shown that a proposed flat lens capable of focussing light
with pure geometric phase shifts can switch from being convex to a concave lens

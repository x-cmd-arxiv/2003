none of the three infrared components of T Tau coincide with the compact radio
source that has apparently been ejected recently from the system (Loinard,
Rodriguez, and Rodriguez 2003). The compact radio source and one of the three
infrared objects, T Tau Sb, have distinct paths that depart from orbital or
uniform motion between 1997 and 2000, perhaps indicating that their interaction
led to the ejection of the radio source. The path that T Tau Sb took between
1997 and 2003 may indicate that this star is still bound to the presumably more
massive southern component, T Tau Sa. The radio source is absent from our
near-infrared images and must therefore be fainter than K = 10.2 (if located
within 100 mas of T Tau Sb, as the radio data would imply), still consistent
with an identity as a low-mass star or substellar object.

stellar evolution models in the 0.7-1.1 M_sun mass range and accurately
measured properties of binary stars with components in this mass range. We
study one of these objects, the eclipsing binary UV Piscium, which is
particularly interesting because Popper (1997) derived age estimates for each
component which differed by more than a factor of two. In an attempt to solve
this significant discrepancy (a difference in age of 11 Gyr), we compute a
large grid of stellar evolution models with the CESAM code for each component.
By fixing the masses to their accurately determined values (relative error
smaller than 1% for both stars), we consider a wide range of possible
metallicities Z (0.01 to 0.05), and Helium content Y (0.25 to 0.34)
uncorrelated to Z. In addition, the mixing length parameter alpha_MLT is left
as another free parameter. We obtain a best fit in the T_eff-radius diagram for
a common chemical composition (Z, Y)=(0.012, 0.31), but a different MLT
parameter alpha_MLT_A = 0.95+-0.12(statistical)+0.30(systematic) and
alpha_MLT_B = 0.65+-0.07(stat)+0.10(syst). The apparent age discrepancy found
by Popper (1997) disappears with this solution, the components being coeval to
within 1%. This suggests that fixing alpha_MLT to its solar value (~1.6), a
common hypothesis assumed in most stellar evolutionary models, may not be
correct. Secondly, since alpha_MLT is smaller for the less massive component,
this suggests that the MLT parameter may decrease with stellar mass, showing
yet another shortcoming of the mixing length theory to explain stellar
convection. This trend needs further confirmation with other binary stars with
accurate data.

on a theory. A two-dimensional charged stringy black hole is investigated in

totally nonnegative part of a Grassmannian, denoted Gr_{kn}+, and showed that
this set of cells is isomorphic as a graded poset to many other interesting
graded posets. The main result of this paper is an explicit generating function
which enumerates the cells in Gr_{kn}+ according to their dimension. As a
corollary, we give a new proof that the Euler characteristic of Gr_{kn}+ is 1.
Additionally, we use our result to produce a new q-analog of the Eulerian
numbers, which interpolates between the Eulerian numbers, the Narayana numbers,
and the binomial coefficients.

initial state is an arbitrary pure quantum state $|\phi>$ of $n$ qubits. It is
shown that the optimal time to perform the measurement is independent of $|
\phi>$, namely, it is identical to the optimal time in the original algorithm
in which $| \phi > = | 0>$, with the same number of marked states, $r$. The
probability of success $P_{\rm s}$ is obtained, in terms of the amplitudes of
the state $| \phi>$, and is shown to be independent of $r$. A class of states,
which includes fixed points and cycles of the Grover iteration operator is
identified. The relevance of these results in the context of using the success
probability as an entanglement measure is discussed. In particular, the
Groverian entanglement measure, previously limited to a single marked state, is
generalized to the case of several marked states.

algorithm is studied. This type of noise may result from tiny fluctuations and
drift in the parameters of the (quantum) components performing the computation.
The resulting operations are still unitary, but not precisely those assumed in
the design of the algorithm. Here we focus on the effect of such noise in the
Hadamard gate $W$, which is an essential component in each iteration of the
quantum search process. To this end $W$ is replaced by a noisy Hadamard gate
$U$. The parameters of $U$ at each iteration are taken from an arbitrary
probability distribution (e.g. Gaussian distribution) and are characterized by
their statistical moments around the parameters of $W$. For simplicity we
assume that the noise is unbiased and isotropic, namely all noise variables in
the parametrization we use have zero average and the same standard deviation
$\epsilon$. The noise terms at different calls to $U$ are assumed to be
uncorrelated. For a search space of size $N=2^n$ (where $n$ is the number of
qubits used to span this space) it is found that as long as $\epsilon <
O(n^{-{1/2}} N^{-{1/4}})$, the algorithm maintains significant efficiency,
while above this noise level its operation is hampered completely. It is also
found that below this noise threshold, when the search fails, it is likely to
provide a state that differs from the marked state by only a few bits. This
feature can be used to search for the marked state by a classical
post-processing, even if the quantum search has failed, thus improving the
success rate of the search process.

that two testable inequalities for the statistical predictions of two-qubit

that quantum mechanics respects a nonlocal classical realism, and it is
locality that is incompatible with experimental observations and quantum
mechanics.

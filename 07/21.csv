discuss possible observational consequences. The structure and stability of
very massive stars are reviewed. Because of high accretion rates, quasar disks
are massive and the fringes of their optically luminous parts are prone to
fragmentation. Starting from a few hundred solar masses, a dominant fragment
will grow to the isolation mass, which is a significant fraction of the disk
mass, more quickly than the fragment contracts onto the stellar main sequence.
A gap will form in the disk and the star will migrate inward on the accretion
timescale, which is comparable to the star's main sequence lifetime. By
interrupting the gas supply to the inner disk, the gap may temporarily dim and
redden the quasar. The final stages of stellar migration will be a strong
source of low-frequency gravitational waves.

that the ratio of extinction to X-ray absorption is 0.1-0.7 times that expected

than an existence of black holes contradicts to the equivalence principle. In
such the model, Newton's constant is proportional to $H^{2}/T^{4},$ where $H$
is the Hubble constant, $T$ is an equivalent temperature of the graviton

show that conditions leading to isotropisation fall into 3 classes,

$I$ model reaches a stable isotropic state due to the presence of several
massive scalar fields minimally coupled to the metric with a perfect fluid for
class 1 isotropisation. The conditions are written in terms of some functions
$\ell$ of the scalar fields. Two types of theories are studied. The first one
deals with scalar tensor theories resulting from extra-dimensions
compactification, where the Brans-Dicke coupling functions only depend on their
associated scalar fields. The second one is related to the presence of complex
scalar fields. We give the metric and potential asymptotical behaviours
originating from class 1 isotropisation. The results depend on the domination
of the scalar field potential compared to the perfect fluid energy density. We
give explicit examples showing that some hybrid inflation theories do not lead
to isotropy contrary to some high-order theories, whereas the most common forms
of complex scalar fields undergo a class 3 isotropisation, characterised by
strong oscillations of the $\ell$ functions.

(sin^2\theta_13) and to the type of mass hierarchy/ordering (sign[Delta
m^2_13]). These observables are: the ratio of average energies of the spectra,
r_E =<E>/<\bar E >, the ratio of widths of the energy distributions, r_Gamma =
Gamma/\bar Gamma, the ratios of total numbers of nu_e and antinu_e events at
low energies, S, and in the high energy tails, R_tail. I show that regions in
the space of observables r_E, r_Gamma, R_tail exist in which certain mass
hierarchy and intervals of sin^2\theta_13 can be identified or discriminated.
Finally, I discuss the potential of studying regeneration effects on nu_e and
antinu_e in the matter of the Earth and point out that both the observation or
exclusion of these effects lead to model-independent information on
sin^2\theta_13 and the mass hierarchy. The extraction of this information would
highly benefit from the presence of a new, large, long lived nu_e detector, and
from the progress of theoretical predictions of the fluxes and energy spectra
of the neutrinos originally produced in the star.

energy-momentum tensor in classical field theory, with emphasis on a geometric
point of view. The necessity of ``improving'' the expressions provided by the
canonical Noether procedure is addressed and given an adequate geometric
framework. The main new ingredient is the explicit formulation of a principle
of ``ultralocality'' with respect to the symmetry generators, which is shown to
fix the ambiguity inherent in the procedure of improvement and guide it towards
a unique answer: when combined with the appropriate splitting of the fields
into sectors, it leads to the well-known expressions for the current as the
variational derivative of the matter field Lagrangian with respect to the gauge
field and for the energy-momentum tensor as the variational derivative of the
matter field Lagrangian with respect to the metric tensor. In the second case,
the procedure is shown to work even when the matter field Lagrangian depends
explicitly on the curvature, thus establishing the correct relation between
scale invariance, in the form of local Weyl invariance ``on shell'', and
tracelessness of the energy-momentum tensor, required for a consistent
definition of the concept of a conformal field theory.

composite quantum system? It has been shown that all two-body Hamiltonian
evolutions can be simulated using \emph{any} fixed two-body entangling
$n$-qubit Hamiltonian and fast local unitaries. By \emph{entangling} we mean
that every qubit is coupled to every other qubit, if not directly, then
indirectly via intermediate qubits. We extend this study to the case where
interactions may involve more than two qubits at a time. We find necessary and
sufficient conditions for an arbitrary $n$-qubit Hamiltonian to be
\emph{dynamically universal}, that is, able to simulate any other Hamiltonian
acting on $n$ qubits, possibly in an inefficient manner. We prove that an
entangling Hamiltonian is dynamically universal if and only if it contains at
least one coupling term involving an \emph{even} number of interacting qubits.
For \emph{odd} entangling Hamiltonians, i.e., Hamiltonians with couplings that
involve only an odd number of qubits, we prove that dynamic universality is
possible on an encoded set of $n-1$ logical qubits. We further prove that an
odd entangling Hamiltonian can simulate any other odd Hamiltonian and classify
the algebras that such Hamiltonians generate. Thus, our results show that up to
local unitary operations, there are only two fundamentally different types of
entangling Hamiltonian on $n$ qubits. We also demonstrate that, provided the
number of qubits directly coupled by the Hamiltonian is bounded above by a
constant, our techniques can be made efficient.

"quant-ph/0307149","Scott Aaronson","Scott Aaronson","Lower Bounds for Local Search by Quantum Arguments","20 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC",,"  The problem of finding a local minimum of a black-box function is central for
understanding local search as well as quantum adiabatic algorithms. For
functions on the Boolean hypercube {0,1}^n, we show a lower bound of
Omega(2^{n/4}/n) on the number of queries needed by a quantum computer to solve
this problem. More surprisingly, our approach, based on Ambainis' quantum
adversary method, also yields a lower bound of Omega(2^{n/2}/n^2) on the
problem's classical randomized query complexity. This improves and simplifies a
1983 result of Aldous. Finally, in both the randomized and quantum cases, we
give the first nontrivial lower bounds for finding local minima on grids of
constant dimension greater than 2.

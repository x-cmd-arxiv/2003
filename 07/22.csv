luminosity-to-mass (L/M) ratio of ~ 300 low-z quasars and luminous Seyfert 1
nuclei. We analyze: (1) whether radio-quiet and radio-loud objects show
systematic differences in terms of M and L/M; (2) the influence of M and L/M on
the shape of the H-beta broad component line profile; (3) the significance of
the so-called ""blue outliers"" i.e., sources showing a significant blueshift of
the [OIII] 4959, 5007 lines with respect to the narrow component of H-beta
which is used as an estimator of the quasar reference frame. We show that M and
L/M distributions for RQ and RL sources are likely different for samples
matched in luminosity and redshift. Line profile comparisons for median spectra
computed over narrow ranges of M and L/M indicate that a Lorentz function
provides a better fit for higher L/M sources and a double Gaussian for lower
L/M values. A second (redshifted) Gaussian component at low L/M appears as a
red asymmetry frequently observed in radio-loud and radio-quiet sources with
broader (FWHM > 4000 km/s) H-beta broad component profiles. This component
becomes stronger in larger mass and lower L/M sources. No specific influence of
radio loudness on the H-beta broad component profile is detected, although
equivalent widths of H-beta broad component and especially of [OIII] 4959,5007
are larger for radio-loud sources. We identify five more ""blue outlier""
sources. Since these sources are, on average, one magnitude brighter than other
AGNs with similar mass, they are accreting at an Eddington ratio that is 2-3
times higher. We hint at evolutionary effects that explain some of these
results and reinforce the ""Eigenvector 1"" correlations.

the source breakdown includes Broad Line AGN, Narrow Emission-Line Galaxies,
and optically ``normal'' galaxies. All the ten sources at z>1 are

density profiles including the NFW profile, a modified NFW profile proposed by
Hayashi et al.(2003) to account for the effects of tidal stripping, and an
isothermal sphere with a core. We find that the gamma-ray flux expected from
these models may be detectable by GLAST for a significant part of the
neutralino parameter space. The prospects for existing and upcoming Atmospheric
Cherenkov Telescopes are less optimistic, as unrealistically long exposures are
required for detection. However, the effects of adiabatic compression due to
the baryonic component may improve the chances for detection by ACTs. The
maximum flux we predict is well below EGRET's measurements and thus EGRET does
not constrain the parameter space. The expected synchrotron emission generally
lies below the observed radio emission from the LMC in the frequency range of
19.7 to 8550 MHz. As long as <sigma v> <2x 10^-26 cm^3 s^-1 for a neutralino
mass of 50 GeV, the observed radio emission is not primarily due to neutralinos
and is consistent with the assumption that the main source is cosmic rays. We
find that the predicted fluxes, obtained by integrating over the entire LMC,
are not very strongly dependent on the inner slope of the halo profile, varying
by less than an order of magnitude for the range of profiles we considered.

relatively bright (K'~19) secondary point source 0.4"" or 400 pc in projection
southwest of the radio nucleus. The object is also visible in archival Hubble
Space Telescope optical images, although it is easily confused with the
underlying structure of the host. Although the near infrared colors of this
secondary point source are roughly consistent with those of an L-dwarf, its
spectrum and optical-to-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) virtually
rule out the possibility that it may be any foreground projected object. We
conclude that the secondary point source is likely to be an extragalactic
object associated with Cygnus A. We consider several interpretations of the
nature of this object, including: a young star cluster peering through the dust
at the edge of one of the ionization cones; an older, large globular cluster; a
compact cloud of dust or electrons that is acting as a mirror of the hidden
active nucleus; and the dense core of a gas stripped satellite galaxy that is
merging with the giant elliptical host. The data presented here are most
consistent with the minor merger scenario. The spectra and SED of the object
suggest that it may be a densely packed conglomeration of older stars heavily
extincted by dust, and its high luminosity and compact nature are consistent
with those of a satellite that has been stripped to its tidal radius. Further
spectroscopic observations are nevertheless necessary to confirm this
possibility.

and spectral types for radio sources brighter than R=21.5mag (total of 82).
Sources with R<21.5mag and spiral galaxy SEDs (34) are grouped into two
redshift bins with a median of z=0.240 and 0.455 respectively. Stacking
analysis for both the 0.5-2 and 2-8keV bands is performed on these subsamples.
A high confidence level signal (>3.5sigma) is detected in the 0.5-2keV band
corresponding to a mean flux of ~3e-16cgs for both subsamples. This flux
translates to mean luminosities of ~5e40 and 1.5e41cgs for the z=0.240 and
0.455 subsamples respectively. Only a marginally significant signal (2.6sigma)
is detected in the 2-8keV band for the z=0.455 subsample. We argue that the
stacked signal above is dominated by star-formation. The mean L_X/L_B ratio and
the mean L_X of the two subsamples are found to be higher than optically
selected spirals and similar to starbursts. We also find that the mean L_X and
L_1.4 of the faint radio sources studied here are consistent with the L_X-L_1.4
correlation of local star-forming galaxies. Moreover, the X-ray emissivity of
sub-mJy sources to z~0.3 is found to be elevated compared to local HII
galaxies. The observed increase is consistent with L_X evolution of the form
(1+z)^3. Assuming that our sample is indeed dominated by starbursts this is
direct evidence for evolution of such systems at X-ray wavelengths. Using an
empirical L_X to SFR conversion we estimate a global SFR density at z~0.3 of
\~0.029M_o/yr/Mpc in agreement with previous studies.

black holes in merging galactic bulges do indeed merge. Otherwise the ejection
of supermassive black holes by gravitational slingshot would lead to excessive

explosion center. At 50 d, SN1993J is almost unresolved with a radius of 520
AU. The shell structure becomes discernible at 175 d. The brightness of the
ridge of the projected shell is not uniform, but rather varies by a factor of
two, having a distinct maximum to the south-east and a minimum to the west.
Over the next ~350 d, this pattern appears to rotate counter-clockwise. After
two years, the structure becomes more complex with hot spots developing in the
east, south, and west. The pattern of modulation continues to change, and after
five years the three hot spots have shifted somewhat. After nine years, the
radio shell has expanded to a radius of 19,000 AU. The brightness in the center
of the images is lower than expected for an optically thin, spherical shell.
Absorption in the center is favored over a thinner shell in the back and/or

structures within tidal tails. Six regions of tidal debris in the four classic
``Toomre Sequence'' mergers: NGC 4038/39 (``Antennae''), NGC 3256, NGC 3921,
and NGC 7252 (``Atoms for Peace'') have been studied in order to explore how
the star formation depends upon the local and global physical conditions. These
mergers sample a range of stages in the evolutionary sequence and tails with
and without embedded tidal dwarf galaxies. The six tails are found to contain a
variety of stellar structures, with sizes ranging from those of globular
clusters up to those of dwarf galaxies. From V and I WFPC2 images, we measure
the luminosities and colors of the star clusters. NGC 3256 is found to have a
large population of blue clusters (0.2 < V-I < 0.9), particularly in its
Western tail, similar to those found in the inner region of the merger. In
contrast, NGC 4038/39 has no clusters in the observed region of the tail, only
less luminous point sources likely to be individual stars. A significant
cluster population is clearly associated with the prominent tidal dwarf
candidates in the eastern and western tails of NGC 7252. The cluster-rich
Western tail of NGC 3256 is not distinguished from the others by its dynamical
age or by its total HI mass. However, the mergers that have few clusters in the
tail all have tidal dwarf galaxies, while NGC 3256 does not have prominent
tidal dwarfs. We speculate that star formation in tidal tails may manifest
itself either in small structures like clusters along the tail or in large
structures such as dwarf galaxies, but not in both. Also, NGC 3256 has the
highest star formation rate of the four mergers studied, which may contribute
to the high number of star clusters in its tidal tails.

349+2 performed in February 2001 and covering the broad energy range 0.12-200
keV. The light curve obtained from these observations shows a large flaring
activity, the count rate varying from ~130 to ~260 counts/s, indicating that
the source was in the flaring branch during these observations. The average
spectrum is well described by a soft blackbody and a Comptonized component. To
well fit the energy spectrum three gaussian lines are needed at 1.2 keV, 2.6
keV, and 6.7 keV with corresponding equivalent widths of 13 eV, 10 eV, and 39
eV, probably associated to L-shell emission of Fe XXIV, Ly-alpha S XVI, and Fe
XXV, respectively. These lines may be produced at different distances from the
neutron star, which increase when the count rate of the source increases. An
absorption edge is also needed at 9 keV with an optical depth of ~3 10^{-2}.
  From the Color-Color Diagram (CD) we selected five zones from which we
extracted the corresponding energy spectra. The temperatures of the blackbody
and of the Comptonized component tend to increase when the intensity of the
source increases. We discuss our results comparing them to those obtained from
a previous BeppoSAX observation, performed in March 2000, during which the
source was a similar position of its Z-track. In particular we find that,
although the source showed similar spectral states in the 2000 and the 2001
observations, a hard tail, that was significantly detected in March 2000, is
not observed in these recent observations.

afterglows from long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Here we use it to investigate the
so-called early afterglows from short GRBs, which arises from blast waves that
are not decelerated considerably by their surrounding medium. We consider a
nearby medium loaded with $e^{\pm}$ pairs (Beloborodov 2002). The temporal
behaviors show first a soft-to-hard spectral evolution, from the optical to
hard X-ray, and then a usual hard-to-soft evolution after the blast waves begin
to decelerate. The light curves show variability, and consist of two peaks. The
first peak, due to the pair effect, can be observed in the X-ray, though too
faint and too short in the optical. The second peak will be easily detected by
{\it Swift}. We show that detections of the double-peak structure in the light
curves of early afterglows are very helpful to determine all the shock
parameters of short GRBs, including both the parameters of the relativistic
source and the surroundings. Besides, from the requirement that the
forward-shock emission in short GRBs should be below the BATSE detection
threshold, we give a strong constraint on the shock model parameters. In
particular, the initial Lorentz factor of the source is limited to be no more
than $\sim 10^3$, and the ambient medium density is inferred to be low, $n\la
10^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$.

Galactic superluminal jet sources share the common spectral characteristic that
they have unusually high disk temperatures which cannot be explained in the
framework of the standard optically thick accretion disk in the Schwarzschild
metric. On the other hand, the standard accretion disk around the Kerr black
hole might explain the observed high disk temperature, as the inner radius of
the Kerr disk gets smaller and the disk temperature can be consequently higher.
However, we point out that the observable Kerr disk spectra becomes
significantly harder than Schwarzschild disk spectra only when the disk is
highly inclined. This is because the emission from the innermost part of the
accretion disk is Doppler-boosted for an edge-on Kerr disk, while hardly seen
for a face-on disk. The Galactic superluminal jet sources are known to be
highly inclined systems, thus their energy spectra may be explained with the
standard Kerr disk with known black hole masses. For ULXs, on the other hand,
the standard Kerr disk model seems implausible, since it is highly unlikely
that their accretion disks are preferentially inclined, and, if edge-on Kerr
disk model is applied, the black hole mass becomes unreasonably large (> 300
M_solar). Instead, the slim disk (advection dominated optically thick disk)
model is likely to explain the observed super-Eddington luminosities, hard
energy spectra, and spectral variations of ULXs. We suggest that ULXs are
accreting black holes with a few tens of solar mass, which is not unexpected
from the standard stellar evolution scenario, and that their X-ray emission is
from the slim disk shining at super-Eddington luminosities.

of matter which can arise in correlated electron systems in 2+1-dimensions.
These states are characterized by particle-like excitations exhibiting exotic
braiding statistics. $P$ and $T$ invariance are maintained by a `doubling' of
the low-energy degrees of freedom which occurs naturally without doubling the
underlying microscopic degrees of freedom. The simplest examples have been the
subject of considerable interest as proposed mechanisms for high-$T_c$
superconductivity. One is the `doubled' version (i.e. two opposite-chirality
copies) of the U(1) chiral spin liquid. The second example corresponds to $Z_2$
gauge theory, which describes a scenario for spin-charge separation. Our main
concern, with an eye towards applications to quantum computation, are richer
models which support non-Abelian statistics. All of these models, richer or
poorer, lie in a tightly-organized discrete family. The physical inference is
that a material manifesting the $Z_2$ gauge theory or a doubled chiral spin
liquid might be easily altered to one capable of universal quantum computation.
These phases of matter have a field-theoretic description in terms of gauge
theories which, in their infrared limits, are topological field theories. We
motivate these gauge theories using a parton model or slave-fermion
construction and show how they can be solved exactly. The structure of the
resulting Hilbert spaces can be understood in purely combinatorial terms. The
highly-constrained nature of this combinatorial construction, phrased in the
language of the topology of curves on surfaces, lays the groundwork for a
strategy for constructing microscopic lattice models which give rise to these
phases.

flow when monochromatic sources of equal strength (at the filter frequency) are
simultaneously turned on at both ends. This result is conjectured to be general
for one dimensional scattering. It is also shown that although simultaneous

model which has very interesting properties when the relevant ions are located
at sites with high (e. g. cubic) symmetry. In that case, if the crystal field
splitting is large one may consider excitations confined to the lowest
threefold degenerate $t_{2g}$ orbital states. When the electron hopping matrix
element ($t$) is much smaller than the on-site Coulomb interaction energy
($U$), the Hubbard model can be mapped onto the well-known effective
Hamiltonian (at order $t^{2}/U$) derived by Kugel and Khomskii (KK). Recently
we have shown that the KK Hamiltonian does not support long range spin order at
any nonzero temperature due to several novel hidden symmetries that it
possesses. Here we extend our theory to show that these symmetries also apply
to the underlying three-band Hubbard model. Using these symmetries we develop a
rigorous Mermin-Wagner construction, which shows that the three-band Hubbard
model does not support spontaneous long-range spin order at any nonzero
temperature and at any order in $t/U$ -- despite the three-dimensional lattice
structure. Introduction of spin-orbit coupling does allow spin ordering, but
even then the excitation spectrum is gapless due to a subtle continuous
symmetry. Finally we showed that these hidden symmetries dramatically simplify
the numerical exact diagonalization studies of finite clusters.

weights of one and two-particle states with bond alternation all the way up to
the limit of the uniform chain ($\lambda=1$). In agreement with Schmidt and

standard Kibble-Zurek formalism caused by the existence of the unperfections in
the system. We know that the distribution of kinks created during a second
order phase transition in pure systems is determined solely by the correlation
length at freeze-out time. The correlation length at that instant of time
intuitively describes the size of the defect and therefore the number density
of defects is limited by the possibility of holding kinks in a unit volume. On
the other hand if the system is populated by the impurities then kinks emerge
mainly in knots of the force distribution which correspond to extremes of the
impurity potential i.e. positions of imperfections. The purpose of this report
is to show that, due to existence of the strong gradients of the impurity
potential, kinks can be created mainly in the close vicinity of the impurities.
It seems that this simple mechanism can be responsible for occurrence, in the
number density formula, the additional length scale describing the impurity
distribution. We know that in pure systems, as a consequence of kink-antikink
annihilation, the number density of kinks decrease in time. In contradiction to
pure systems, kinks produced in the systems populated by impurities could be
confined by the impurity centers and therefore they may not disappear from the
system and may remain above the level established by thermal nucleation of
pairs.

ferromagnetic quantum wires. Due to the transverse confinement, conduction
channels arise. In the presence of a domain wall, spin up and spin down
electrons in these channels become coupled. For very short domain walls or at
high longitudinal kinetic energy, this coupling is weak, leads to very few spin
flips, and a perturbative treatment is possible. For very long domain wall
structures, the spin follows adiabatically the local magnetization orientation,
suppressing the effect of the domain wall on the total transmission, but
reversing the spin of the electrons. In the intermediate regime, we numerically
investigate the spin-dependent transport behavior for different shapes of the
domain wall. We find that the knowledge of the precise shape of the domain wall
is not crucial for determining the qualitative behavior. For parameters

relatively fast disappearance of the feature associated with the pi-band gap at

to increase linearly with field. Field dependences of the order parameters

applied parallel and perpendicular to the film, at T = 4.2 K. In perpendicular

  Calibration","6 pages, 6 PostScript figures",,,,"cs.CV",,"  The common approach to radial distortion is by the means of polynomial
approximation, which introduces distortion-specific parameters into the camera
model and requires estimation of these distortion parameters. The task of
estimating radial distortion is to find a radial distortion model that allows
easy undistortion as well as satisfactory accuracy. This paper presents a new
piecewise radial distortion model with easy analytical undistortion formula.
The motivation for seeking a piecewise radial distortion model is that, when a
camera is resulted in a low quality during manufacturing, the nonlinear radial
distortion can be complex. Using low order polynomials to approximate the
radial distortion might not be precise enough. On the other hand, higher order
polynomials suffer from the inverse problem. With the new piecewise radial
distortion function, more flexibility is obtained and the radial undistortion
can be performed analytically. Experimental results are presented to show that
with this new piecewise radial distortion model, better performance is achieved
than that using the single function. Furthermore, a comparable performance with
the conventional polynomial model using 2 coefficients can also be
accomplished.

lowest glueball masses and the mass ratio. Evidence that rotational symmetry is
established more accurately for the Symanzik improved anisotropic action is
presented. The discretization errors in the static potential and the
renormalization of the bare anisotropy are found to be only a few percent
compared to errors of about 20-25% for the unimproved gauge action. Evidence of
scaling in the string tension, antisymmetric mass gap and the mass ratio is
observed in the weak coupling region and the behaviour is tested against
analytic and numerical results obtained in various other Hamiltonian studies of
the theory. We find that more accurate determination of the scaling
coefficients of the string tension and the antisymmetric mass gap has been
achieved, and the agreement with various other Hamiltonian studies of the

configuration in the lightcone worldsheet description of planar Tr\Phi^3 field
theory. Then, using a mean field formalism, we take the remaining planar
diagrams into account in an average way. The fishnet spin configuration
requires two mean fields \phi,\phi' where the fishnet diagram is the case
\phi=1,\phi'=0. For general values of these fields, the system is then
approximated as a light-cone quantized string with a field dependent effective
string tension T_{eff}(\phi,\phi'). We also calculate the worldsheet energy
density E(\phi,\phi'), and find the field values that minimize it in the
presence of a transverse space infra-red cutoff \epsilon>0. The criterion for
string formation is that the tension in this minimum energy state remains
non-zero as \epsilon goes to 0. In the most simple-minded implementation of the
mean field method, we find that the tension vanishes for weak and moderate
coupling, but for very large coupling stays non-zero. A more elaborate
treatment, taking temporal correlations into account, removes this ``phase
transition'' and the string tension of the minimum energy state vanishes for
all values of the coupling when \epsilon goes to 0. Our mean field analysis
thus suggests that the ``fishnet phase'' of Tr\Phi^3 theory is unstable, and
there is no string formation for any value of the coupling. This is probably a
reasonable outcome given the instability of the underlying theory.

Hopf algebraic techniques are used to deal with this complexity and show that
the Schwinger-Dyson equations are modified in a non-trivial way. The hierarchy
of Green functions is derived for degenerate systems, and the case of a single
electron in a two-fold degenerate orbital is calculated in detail.

in terms of generalized fields. Recently, a superfields approach of obtaining
solutions of the Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation is also established.
Superfields formalism is usually applied to topological quantum field theories.
However, generalized fields method is suitable to find solutions of the
Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation either for topological quantum field
theories or the usual gauge theories like Yang-Mills theory. We show that by
truncating some components of superfields with appropriate actions, generalized
fields formalism of the usual gauge theories result. We demonstrate that for
some topological quantum field theories and the relativistic particle both of
the methods possess the same field contents and yield similar results. Inspired
by the observed relations we give the solution of the BV-master equation for
on-shell N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory utilizing superfields.

relatively soft photons, not hard enough to create an electron-positron pair,

magnetic field B exceeds the critical value of Bcr=m^2/e=4.4 10^13 Gauss. Three
leading terms in the asymptotic expansion of the one-loop polarization operator
in a constant magnetic field are found for B>>Bcr, and the corresponding
refraction index is shown to depend only on the propagation direction of the
photon relative to the external field. It is established, that the refraction
index for one of polarization modes unlimitedly grows with the field, while the
other is saturated at a moderate level. The photon capture effect is extended
to soft photons. The results may be essential in studying reflection,
refraction and splitting of X-rays, light and radio waves by magnetic fields of
magnetars, as well as in considering emission of such waves by charged

important to discretise stochastic partial differential equations carefully, as

partons proliferate via secondary radiative $gg \to ggg$ processes until the
thermalization is reached for some assumptions. The extended system is
thermalized at about $t=1.6$ fm/$c$ with $T = 570$ MeV and stays in equilibrium
for about 2 fm/$c$ with breaking temperature $T = 360$ MeV in the rapidity

a model which is based on the assumption that a nucleus-nucleus collision is a
superposition of isotropically decaying thermal sources at a given freeze out
temperature. The freeze-out temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions is fixed
from the inverse slope of the transverse momentum spectra of hadrons in
nucleon-nucleon collision. The successive collisions in the nuclear reaction
leads to gain in transverse momentum, as the nucleons propagate in the nucleus
following a random walk pattern. The average transverse rapidity shift per
collision is determined from the nucleon-nucleus collision data. Using these
information we obtain parameter free result for the transverse momentum
distribution of produced hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions. It is observed
that such a model is able to explain the transverse mass spectra of produced
pions at SPS energies. However it fails to satisfactorily explain the
transverse mass spectra of kaons and protons. This indicates the presence of
collective effect which cannot be accounted for by the initial state collision
broadening of transverse momentum of produced hadrons, the basis of random walk
model.

aperture mass statistic for weak lensing surveys which is insensitive to
masking effects of survey geometry or variable survey depth. The calculation is
the higher order analog of the formula given by Schneider et al (2002) which
has been used to compute the variance of the aperture mass from several lensing
surveys. As our formula requires the three-point shear correlation function, we
also present an efficient tree-based algorithm for measuring it. We show how
our algorithm would scale in computing time and memory usage for future lensing
surveys. Finally, we apply the procedure to our CTIO survey data, originally
described in Jarvis et al (2003). We find that the skewness is positive
(inconsistent with zero) at the 2 sigma level. However, the signal is too noisy
from this data to usefully constrain cosmology.

(Gamma = 2.5) components. X-ray reflection models yield improved fits. A
strong, relativistic Fe K-alpha emission line is revealed, indicating that the
inner disk extends to the innermost stable circular orbit. The breadth of the

significant angular momentum. Absorption lines from H-like and He-like O, and
He-like Ne and Mg are detected, as well as lines which are likely due to Ne II

absorption with the coronal phase of the interstellar medium. A scenario
wherein the absorption lines are due to an intrinsic AGN-like warm-absorber
geometry -- perhaps produced by a disk wind in an extended disk-dominated state
-- may be more viable. We compare our results to Chandra observations of the

confirm the presence of an excess absorbing column N_H ~ 4 x 10^21 cm^-2 at the

both the Chandra and archival ROSAT PSPC data, we obtain very good fits for
both a partially covered neutral absorber and a low-ionization (U = 0.03)

MgII absorber. Based on a moderate resolution (80 km/s) MMT spectrum we show
that the absorber is highly saturated and has a covering fraction less than

scientific use of the Arecibo telescope in a VLBI observation with the VLBA.
The high- and low-resolution radio continuum images reveal several new
continuum structures in the nuclear region of this galaxy. At ~100 mas
resolution, we distinguish six continuum structures extending over 1.4 arcsec,
with a total flux density of 138 mJy. Only three of these structures were known
previously. All these structures seem to be related to AGN activity. At the
full resolution of the array, we only detect two of the six continuum
structures. Both are composed of several compact components with brightness
temperatures on the order of $10^{7}$ K. While it is possible that one of these
compact structures could host an AGN, they could also be shock-like features
formed by the interaction of the jet with compact interstellar clouds in the
nuclear region of this galaxy. Complex H I absorption is detected with our VLBI
array at both high and low angular resolution. Assuming that the widest H I
feature is associated with a rotating H I disk or torus feeding a central AGN,
we estimate an enclosed dynamical mass of ~7 x 10^7 M_sun, comparable to the
value derived from the hidden broad H$\beta$ emission in this galaxy. The
narrower H I lines could represent clumpy neutral hydrogen structures in the H
I torus. The detection of H I absorption toward some of the continuum
components, and its absence toward others, suggest an inclined H I disk or

Synchrotron-Self Compton (SSC) radiation from relativistically moving
homogeneous plasma blobs. In the context of these models, the blob Lorentz
factors needed to reproduce the corrected for absorption by the diffuse IR
background (DIRB) TeV emission are large ($\delta \gtrsim 50$). The main reason
for this is that stronger beaming eases the problem of the lack of $\sim$ IR-UV
synchrotron seed photons needed to produce the de-absorbed $\sim $ few TeV peak
of the spectral energy distribution (SED). However, such high Doppler factors
are in strong disagreement with the unified scheme, according to which BLs are
FR I radio galaxies with their jets closely aligned to the line of sight. Here,
motivated by the detection of sub-luminal velocities in the sub-pc scale jets
of the best studied TeV blazars, MKN 421 and MKN 501, we examine the
possibility that the relativistic flows in the TeV BLs decelerate. In this
case, the problem of the missing seed photons is solved because of Upstream
Compton (UC) scattering, a process in which the upstream energetic electrons
from the fast base of the flow `see' the synchrotron seed photons produced in
the slow part of the flow relativistically beamed. Modest Lorentz factors
($\Gamma \sim 15$), decelerating down to values compatible with the recent
radio interferometric observations, reproduce the $\sim $ few TeV peak energy
of these sources. Furthermore, such decelerating flows are shown to be in
agreement with the BL - FR I unification, naturally reproducing the observed
BL/FR I broad band luminosity ratios.

SPIN technique is based on the detection and comparison of the fringe
characteristics (complex visibility) between two perpendicular directions of
polarization. In particular, we demonstrate that the SPIN technique is very
sensitive to the beta parameter from the so-called 'beta velocity law' for
optically thin winds. Moreover, the location where the bulk of polarization is

sequence OB star winds is still very demanding (inferior to 0.5%), but the
signal expected from denser winds or extended atmospheres is well within the
capabilities of existing interferometers. The visibility curves obtained in two

by more than 35%. The signal expected from the extended circumstellar

ordering kinetics. We explain why the retrival of the scaling properties of
$R(t,s)$ from those of TRM and ZFC is not trivial. Preasymptotic contributions
generate a long crossover in TRM, while ZFC is affected by a dangerous
irrelevant variable. Lack of understanding of both these points has generated
some confusion in the literature. The full picture relating the exponents of
all the quantities involved is explicitely illustrated in the framework of the
large $N$ model. Following this scheme, an assessment of the present status of
numerical simulations for the Ising model can be made. We reach the conclusion
that on the basis of the data available up to now, statements on the scaling
properties of $R(t,s)$ can be made from ZFC but not from TRM. From ZFC data for
the Ising model with $d=2,3,4$ we confirm the previously found linear
dependence on dimensionality of the exponent $a$ entering $R(t,s) \sim
s^{-(1+a)}f(t/s)$. We also find evidence that a recently derived form of the

the coupled tight-binding systems. We calculate reflection- and transmission
coefficients in cases where, besides propagating states, one or two evanescent

the disordered systems. We observe important qualitative changes in these

the evanescent modes for transmission and reflection in the various scattering
channels. In particular, the localization lengths are generally significantly
larger than the values obtained when evanescent modes are absent. Effects
associated with disorder mediated coupling between propagating and evanescent

model for the strong running coupling has recently been developed. Its
underlying idea is to impose the analyticity requirement on the perturbative
expansion of the renormalization group $\beta$ function for restoring the
correct analytic properties of the latter. The proposed model possesses a
number of appealing features. Namely, the analytic invariant charge has no
unphysical singularities at any loop level; it contains no free parameters; it
has universal behavior both in ultraviolet and infrared regions at any loop
level; and it possesses a fair higher loop and scheme stability. The extension
of this model to the timelike region revealed the asymmetrical behavior of the
running coupling in the intermediate- and low-energy domains of spacelike and
timelike regions, that is essential when one handles the experimental data. The
developed approach enables one to describe, in a consistent way, various strong
interaction processes both of perturbative and intrinsically nonperturbative
nature.

interactions are generated by vector meson exchange within the framework of the
standard $SU(3)_V\times SU(3)_A$ invariant effective Lagrangian. In the atomic
sector, the energy levels and decay widths of kaonium are determined by an
eigenvalue equation of the Kudryavtsev--Popov type, with the strong interaction
effects entering through the complex scattering length for $K\bar K$ scattering
and annihilation. The presence of two scalar mesons, $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$,
leads to a ground state energy for the kaonium atom that is shifted above the
point Coulomb value by a few hundred eV. The effect on the lifetime for the
kaonium decay into two pions is much more dramatic. This lifetime is reduced by
two orders of magnitude from $0.8\times 10^{-16}$ sec for annihilation in a
pure Coulomb field down to $3.1\times 10^{-18}$ sec when the strong
interactions are included. The analysis of the two photon decay width of the

In quantum gauge theory of gravity, gravitational gauge interactions of complex
scalar field can be formulated based on gauge principle. After spontaneous
symmetry breaking, if the vacuum of the complex scalar field is not stable and
uniform, there will be a mass term of gravitational gauge field. When
gravitational gauge field propagates in this unstable vacuum of the complex

demonstrate that it can be construed as a toy model for describing and
explaining the basic features of physics in a noncommutative spacetime from a
field theory perspective. The noncommutativity is induced internally through
constraints and does not require external interactions. We show that the
noncommutative space-time is to be interpreted as having an {\it internal}
angular momentum throughout. Subsequently, the elementary excitations - {\it
i.e.} point particles - living on this plane are endowed with a {\it spin}.
This is explicitly demonstrated for the zero-momentum Fourier mode. The study
of these excitations reveals in a natural way various {\it stringy} signatures
of a noncommutative quantum theory, such as dipolar nature of the basic
excitations \cite{jab} and momentum dependent shifts in the interaction point
\cite{big}. The observation \cite{sw} that noncommutative and ordinary field
theories are alternative descriptions of the same underlying theory, is
corroborated here by showing that they are gauge equivalent.
  Also, treating the present model as an explicit example, we show that, even
classically, in the presence of additional constraints, (besides the usual ones
due to reparameterization invariances), the equivalence between Nambu-Goto and
Polyakov formulations is subtle.

conformally flat situations and masses corresponding to Weyl invariant actions,
the propagator is powerlike in the sum of the chordal distances with respect to
AdS(d+1) and S(d'+1). In these cases we analyze its source structure. In all
other cases the propagator depends on both chordal distances separately. There
an explicit formula is found for certain special mass values. For pure AdS we
show how the well known propagators in the Weyl invariant case can be expressed
as linear combinations of simple powers of the chordal distance. For AdS(5) x
S(5) we relate our propagator to the expression in the plane wave limit and
find a geometric interpretation of the variables occurring in the known
explicit construction on the plane wave. As a byproduct of comparing different
techniques, including the KK mode summation, a theorem for summing certain
products of Legendre and Gegenbauer functions is derived.

  Hydration of Aqueous Biomolecular Assemblies","19 pages, 14 figures, one figure added, submitted to Rev. Mod. Phys",,,"LA-UR-03-2144","physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph",,"  Hydrophobic hydration plays a crucial role in self-assembly processes over
multiple length-scales, but the extrapolation of molecular-scale models to
larger length-scale hydration phenomena is sometimes not warranted.
Scaled-particle theories are based upon an interpolative view of that issue. We
revisit the scaled-particle theory proposed thirty years ago by Stillinger,
adopt a practical generalization, and consider the implications for hydrophobic
hydration in light of our current understanding. The generalization is based
upon identifying a molecular length, implicit in previous applications of
scaled-particle models, that provides an effective radius for joining
microscopic and macroscopic descriptions. We demonstrate that the generalized
theory correctly reproduces many of the anomalous thermodynamic properties of
hydrophobic hydration for molecularly sized solutes, including solubility
minima and entropy convergence, successfully interpolates between the
microscopic and macroscopic extremes, and provides new insights into the
underlying molecular mechanisms. The results are discussed in terms of
length-scales associated with component phenomena; in particular we first
discuss the micro-macroscopic joining radius identified by the theory, then we
discuss in turn the Tolman length that leads to an analogous length describing
curvature corrections of a surface area model of hydrophobic hydration free
energies, and the length-scales on which entropy convergence of hydration free
energies are expected.

turbulence is studied systematically using Fourier coefficients in the

are random and independent, the Fourier coefficients tend to Gaussian and

However, if energy-containing motions are intermittent or contaminated with
bounded-amplitude motions such as wavy wakes, the Fourier coefficients tend to
non-Gaussian and dependent of each other. Velocity fluctuations accordingly
tend to non-Gaussian. These situations are found in our experiment of a
rough-wall boundary layer.

(laser or microwave) field. We show that the classically unstable ""asymmetric

maximum interelectronic angle are anchored, can be stabilized by means of a
resonant driving where the frequency of the electromagnetic field equals the
frequency of Kepler-like oscillations along the orbit. A static magnetic field,
oriented parallel to the oscillating electric field of the driving, can be used
to enforce the stability of the configuration with respect to deviations from
collinearity. Quantum Floquet calculations within a collinear model of the
driven two-electron atom reveal the existence of nondispersive wave packets
localized on the stabilized asymmetric stretch orbit, for double excitations
corresponding to principal quantum numbers of the order of N > 10.

second-order relativistic cross sections are compared with data as obtained
from a relativistic long-wavelength approximation as well as from the scaling

contraction may lower the two-photon ionization cross sections by a factor of

probability that the i-th symbol in the chain equals zero (or unity) is a
linear function of the number of unities among the preceding N symbols. The
correlation and distribution functions as well as the variance of number of
symbols in the words of arbitrary length L are obtained analytically and
numerically. A self-similarity of the studied stochastic process is revealed
and the similarity group transformation of the chain parameters is presented.
The diffusion Fokker-Planck equation governing the distribution function of the
L-words is explored. If the persistent correlations are not extremely strong,
the distribution function is shown to be the Gaussian with the variance being
nonlinearly dependent on L. The applicability of the developed theory to the
coarse-grained written and DNA texts is discussed.

detected, jet orientation and pattern/flow speed are considerably constrained.
In this case modeling efforts can place strong limits on conditions in the jet
and in the external environment. This can be done by modeling the spatial
development of helical structures which are sensitively dependent on these
conditions. Along an expanding jet this sensitivity manifests itself in
predictable changes in pattern speed and observed wavelength. In general,
twists of low frequency relative to the local resonant frequency are advected
along the expanding jet into a region in which the twist frequency is high
relative to the local resonant frequency. The wave speed can be very different
in these two frequency regimes. Potential effects include helical twists with a
nearly constant apparent wavelength, an apparent wavelength scaling
approximately with the jet radius for up to two orders of magnitude of jet
expansion, or multiple twist wavelengths with vastly different intrinsic scale
and vastly different wave speeds that give rise to similar observed twist
wavelengths but with very different observed motion. In this paper I illustrate
the basic intrinsic and observed behavior of these structures and show how to
place constraints on jet conditions in superluminal jets using the apparent
structures and motions in the inner 3C 120 jet.

However, in the parallel direction the stability is a serious problem still to
be explained. Interstellar turbulence may allow the generation of Alfv\'en
waves that propagate through the clouds in the magnetic field direction. These
regions also present great amounts of dust particles which can give rise to new
wave modes, or modify the pre-existing ones. The dust-cyclotron damping affects
the Alfv\'en wave propagation near the dust- cyclotron frequency. On the other
hand, the clouds present different grain sizes, which carry different charges.
In this sense, a dust particle distribution has several dust-cyclotron
frequencies and it will affect a broad band of wave frequencies. In this case,
the energy transfer to the gas is more efficient than in the case where the
ion-cyclotron damping is considered alone. This effect becomes more important
if a power law spectrum is considered for the wave energy flux, since the major
part of the energy is concentrated in low-frequency waves. In this work we
calculate the dust- cyclotron damping in a dusty and magnetized dwarf molecular
cloud, as well as determine the changes in the Alfv\'en wave flux. Then, we use
these results to study the gravitational stability of the cloud. We show that,
considering the presence of charged dust particles, the wave flux is rapidly
damped due to dust-cyclotron damping. Then the wave pressure acts in a small
length scale, and cannot explain the observable cloud sizes, but can explain
the existence of small and dense cores.

describe the structure of the initial gas cores as virialized,

allow for rotation of the gas core, assuming angular momentum conservation
inside the sonic point of the flow. In the typical case, most mass then reaches
the star via an accretion disk. The structure of the inner region of this disk
is described with the standard theory of viscous disks, but with allowance for
the substantial energies absorbed in ionizing and dissociating the gas. The
size of the protostar and its luminosity depend upon the accretion rate, the
energetics of the accreting gas, and the ability of the radiation to escape
from the stellar accretion shock. We combine these models for the infall rate,
inner disk structure, and protostellar evolution to predict the radiation field
that is the basis for radiative feedback processes acting against infall (Paper
II). For realistic initial angular momenta, the photosphere of the protostar is
much smaller and hotter than in the spherical case, leading to stronger
radiative feedback at earlier stages in the evolution. In particular, once the
star is older than its Kelvin-Helmholtz time, contraction towards the main
sequence causes a rapid increase in ionizing and far-ultraviolet luminosity at
masses ~30Msun in the fiducial case. Since the cores out of which the first

dynamically unimportant at lower masses, we conclude that the first stars

the universe is an important systematic uncertainty in the use of standard
candles in cosmology. There are two different descriptions of weak lensing
amplification, one uses a local smoothness parameter $\tilde{\alpha}$, the
other uses reduced convergence $\eta= 1+ \kappa/|\kappa_{min}|$ (where $\kappa$
is convergence). The $\tilde{\alpha}$ description involves Dyer-Roeder distance
$D_A(\tilde{\alpha}|z)$ ($\tilde{\alpha}=1$ corresponds to a smooth universe);
it is simple and convenient, and has been used by the community to illustrate
the effect of weak lensing on point sources such as type Ia supernovae. Wang
(1999) has shown that the $\tilde{\alpha}$ description can be made realistic by
allowing $\tilde{\alpha}$ to be a local variable, the local smoothness
parameter. The $\eta$ description has been used by Wang, Holz, & Munshi (2002)
to derive a universal probability distribution (UPDF) for weak lensing
amplification. In this paper, we bridge the two different descriptions of weak
lensing amplification by relating the reduced convergence $\eta$ and the local
smoothness parameter $\tilde{\alpha}$. We give the variance of $\tilde{\alpha}$
in terms of the matter power spectrum, thus providing a quantitative guidance
to the use of Dyer-Roeder distances in illustrating the effect of weak lensing.
The by-products of this work include a corrected definition of the reduced
convergence, and simple and accurate analytical expressions for
$D_A(\tilde{\alpha}|z)$. Our results should be very useful in studying the weak
lensing of standard candles.

variance, sigma_XS^2, are examined. Their statistical properties, relationship
to the power spectrum, and uses for investigating the nature of the variability
processes are discussed. We demonstrate that sigma_XS^2 (or similarly F_var)
shows large changes from one part of the light curve to the next, even when the
variability is produced by a stationary process. This limits the usefulness of
these estimators for quantifying differences in variability amplitude between
different sources or from epoch to epoch in one source. Some examples of the
expected scatter in the variance are tabulated for various typical power
spectral shapes, based on Monte Carlo simulations. The excess variance can be
useful for comparing the variability amplitudes of light curves in different
energy bands from the same observation. Monte Carlo simulations are used to
derive a description of the uncertainty in the amplitude expected between
different energy bands (due to measurement errors). Finally, these estimators
are used to demonstrate some variability properties of the bright Seyfert 1

The semiclassical limit of the cluster methods is analyzed by applying them to
the Falikov-Kimball model in the limit of infinite Hubbard interaction U where
they map to different classical cluster schemes for the Ising model.
Furthermore the Cutkosky-t'Hooft-Veltman cutting equations are generalized and
derived for non translation invariant systems using the Schwinger-Keldysh
formalism. This provides a general setting to discuss causality properties of
cluster methods. To illustrate the method, we prove that PCDMFT is causal while
the nested cluster schemes (NCS) in general and the pair scheme in particular

of shear-banding. In the present paper, we focus on the temporal fluctuations
of the flow field recorded in the coexistence domain. These striking dynamics
are very slow (100--1000s) and cannot be due to external mechanical noise.
Using velocimetry coupled to structural measurements, we show that these
fluctuations are due to a motion of the interface separating the two
differently sheared bands. Such a motion seems to be governed by the
fluctuations of $\sigma^\star$, the local stress at the interface between the
two bands. Our results thus provide more evidence for the relevance of the

interparticle interaction parameters consistent with a given set of
experimental data. Recently, Rutledge has shown (Phys. Rev. E63, 021111 (2001))
that such problems can be generally expressed in terms of a grand canonical
ensemble of polydisperse particles. Within this framework, one identifies a
polydisperse attribute (`pseudo-species') $\sigma$ corresponding to some
appropriate generalized coordinate of the system to hand. Associated with this
attribute is a composition distribution $\bar\rho(\sigma)$ measuring the number
of particles of each species. Its form is controlled by a conjugate chemical
potential distribution $\mu(\sigma)$ which plays the role of the requisite
interparticle interaction potential. Simulation approaches to the inverse
problem involve determining the form of $\mu(\sigma)$ for which
$\bar\rho(\sigma)$ matches the available experimental data. The difficulty in
doing so is that $\mu(\sigma)$ is (in general) an unknown {\em functional} of
$\bar\rho(\sigma)$ and must therefore be found by iteration. At high particle
densities and for high degrees of polydispersity, strong cross coupling between
$\mu(\sigma)$ and $\bar\rho(\sigma)$ renders this process computationally
problematic and laborious. Here we describe an efficient and robust {\em
non-equilibrium} simulation scheme for finding the equilibrium form of
$\mu[\bar\rho(\sigma)]$. The utility of the method is demonstrated by
calculating the chemical potential distribution conjugate to a specific
log-normal distribution of particle sizes in a polydisperse fluid.

gravitational wave (GW) transient events from detector noise. They can be
divided into two generic classes: the coincidence method and the coherent
analysis. The former uses lists of selected events provided by each
interferometer belonging to the network and tries to correlate them in time to
identify a physical signal. Instead of this binary treatment of detector
outputs (signal present or absent), the latter method involves first the
merging of the interferometer data and looks for a common pattern, consistent
with an assumed GW waveform and a given source location in the sky. The
thresholds are only applied later, to validate or not the hypothesis made. As
coherent algorithms use a more complete information than coincidence methods,
they are expected to provide better detection performances, but at a higher
computational cost. An efficient filter must yield a good compromise between a
low false alarm rate (hence triggering on data at a manageable rate) and a high
detection efficiency. Therefore, the comparison of the two approaches is
achieved using so-called Receiving Operating Characteristics (ROC), giving the
relationship between the false alarm rate and the detection efficiency for a
given method. This paper investigates this question via Monte-Carlo
simulations, using the network model developed in a previous article.

benefit from the neutrino and optical emissions associated to the supernova
explosion, in order to discover and study GW radiation in an event already
detected independently. This article aims at presenting some realistic

theory, pressure is naturally defined locally, a point which is obvious in
terms of the stress-tensor but is hidden in the usual thermodynamic approach.

Love mode has been investigated because of its high gravimetric sensitivity.
The acoustic signal launched and detected in the waveguide by electrical
transducers is accompanied by an electromagnetic wave; the interaction of the
two signals, easily enhanced by the open structure of the sensor, creates
interference patterns in the transfer function of the sensor. The influence of
these interferences on the gravimetric sensitivity is presented, whereby the
structure of the entire sensor is modelled. We show that electromagnetic
interferences generate an error in the experimental value of the sensitivity.
This error is different for the open and the closed loop configurations of the
sensor. The theoretical approach is completed by the experimentation of an
actual Love mode sensor operated under liquid in open loop configuration. The

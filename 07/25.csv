extracted in 60-sec bins; this shows a modulation on the orbital period, with a
maximum near photometric phase 0.93 and a minimum half an orbit later. No other
periodic variability was found in the light curve data. We also extracted

in the profile shapes and velocity shifts of the emission lines during an

nuclear reaction network of unprecedented size, up to 1300 isotopes. Sequences
of up to 15 bursts are followed for two choices of accretion rate and
metallicity. At 0.1 Eddington (and 0.02 Eddington for low metallicity),
combined hydrogen-helium flashes occur. The rise times, shapes, and tails of
these light curves are sensitive to the efficiency of nuclear burning at
various waiting points along the rp-process path and these sensitivities are
explored. The bursts show ""compositional inertia"", in that their properties
depend on the fact that accretion occurs onto the ashes of previous bursts
which contain left-over hydrogen, helium and CNO nuclei. This acts to reduce
the sensitivity of burst properties to metallicity. For the accretion rates
studied, only the first anomalous burst in one model produces nuclei as heavy
as A=100, other bursts make chiefly nuclei with A~64. The amount of carbon
remaining after hydrogen-helium bursts is typically <1% by mass, and decreases
further as the ashes are periodically heated by subsequent bursts. At the lower
accretion rate of 0.02 Eddington and solar metallicity, the bursts ignite in a
hydrogen-free helium layer. At the base of this layer, up to 90% of the helium
has already burned to carbon prior to the unstable ignition. These
helium-ignited bursts have briefer, brighter light curves with shorter tails,
very rapid rise times (<0.1 s), and ashes lighter than the iron group.

oblique magnetic fields and arbitrary flow speeds. For ultrarelativistic and
nonrelativistic shocks, the jump conditions may be solved analytically. For
mildly relativistic shocks, analytic solutions are obtained for isotropic
pressure using an approximation for the adiabatic index that is valid in high
sonic Mach number cases. In the more general case of gyrotropic pressure, the
jump conditions cannot be solved analytically without additional assumptions,
and the effects of gyrotropic pressure are investigated by parameterizing the
distribution of pressure parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. Our
numerical solutions reveal that relatively small departures from isotropy
(e.g., about 20%) produce significant changes in the shock compression ratio,
r, at all shock Lorentz factors, including ultrarelativistic ones, where an
analytic solution with gyrotropic pressure is obtained. In particular, either
dynamically important fields or significant pressure anisotropies can incur
marked departures from the canonical gas dynamic value of r=3 for a shocked
ultrarelativistic flow and this may impact models of particle acceleration in
gamma-ray bursts and other environments where relativistic shocks are inferred.
The jump conditions presented apply directly to test-particle acceleration, and
will facilitate future self-consistent numerical modeling of particle
acceleration at oblique, relativistic shocks.

respectively. At wide separations, both distributions are well described by

similar slopes (and similar normalizations as well) argues for similarity of

binaries obey a single power law out to ~1 pc permits strong constraints on
halo dark-matter candidates. At somewhat closer separations (10""<\theta<25""),
the disk distribution shows a pronounced flattening, which is detected at very
high statistical significance and is not due to any obvious systematic effect.

The eclipse ingress and egress are well resolved for the first time in any

emitting region. We find good fits to a simple linear eclipse model, giving
ingress/egress durations of 30+/-3 sec. Remarkably this is shorter than the
ingress/egress duration of the sharp eclipse in the optical as measured by Wood
et al. (1989) and ascribed to the white dwarf (43+/-2 sec). We also find that
the X-ray eclipse is narrower than the optical eclipse by 14+/-2 sec, which is

properties of the energy momentum tensor on the right hand side of the Einstein

the Einstein field equations allow the existence of highly red shifted,

magnetic moments since they do not have trapped surfaces that lead to event
horizons and curvature singularities. Since MECO lifetimes are orders of

formation history. But this background is overwhelmed by foregrounds, which
bias the CIB mean flux and auto correlation measurement severely. Since
dominant foregrounds do not correlate with the large scale structure, the cross
correlation of CIB with galaxies is free of such foregrounds and presents as an
unbiased measure of the star formation history. This also allows the
measurement of CIB based on integrated intensity, whose theoretical prediction
is based on energy conservation, thus is fairly model independent and robust.
The redshift information of CIB sources can be directly recovered with the aid
of galaxy photometric redshifts. In the far IR region, correlation signal is
around 10% at degree scale. Combining FIRAS and SDSS, the cross correlation can
be measured with 20% accuracy (statistical and systematics errors) at $l\sim
40$. Such measurement would allow the measurement of star formation rate with
comparable accuracies to $z\sim 1$. Future CIB experiments with $1^{\circ}$
resolution are able to measure the star formation rate with 10% accuracy to
$z\sim 1.5$. Secondary CMB anisotropies arising from the large scale structure
correlate with CIB. The correlation strength is about $0.5\mu$K at $\sim
10^{\circ}$ (the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect) and $\sim -0.3\mu$K at $\sim
1^{\circ}$ (the Sunyaev Zeldovich effect, Rayleigh-Jeans regime). FIRAS+WMAP

which would clearly help to resolve this issue, have so far been sparse. This
paper reports on new submm observations of seven BALQSOs. The strongest
influence on the observed flux is found to be the redshift, with the two
highest redshift sources appearing intrinsically more submm-luminous than the
lower redshift ones. Since this trend is also seen in other high redshift AGN,
including non-BAL quasars it implies that the dust emission properties of these
systems are no different from those of the general AGN population, which is
difficult to reconcile with the evolutionary interpretation of the BAL
phenomenon.

stars is explained quantitatively with a chemical evolution model of the local
Galaxy that considers - for the first time - the metallicity-dependent
contribution from intermediate mass stars. Previous models that simulate the
variation of Mg isotopic ratios with metallicity in the solar neighbourhood
have attributed the production of Mg25 and Mg26 exclusively to hydrostatic
burning in massive stars.
  These models match the data well for [Fe/H]>-1.0 but severely underestimate
Mg25/Mg24 and Mg26/Mg24 at lower metallicities. Earlier studies have noted that
this discrepancy may indicate a significant role played by intermediate-mass
stars. Only recently have detailed calculations of intermediate-mass stellar
yields of Mg25 and Mg26 become available with which to test this hypothesis. In
an extension of previous work, we present a model that successfully matches the
Mg isotopic abundances in nearby Galactic disk stars through the incorporation
of nucleosynthesis predictions of Mg isotopic production in asymptotic giant
branch stars.

degree wide band along the celestial equator. A new analysis of SDSS data for a
larger field now reveals that the tails of Pal 5 have a much larger spatial
extent and can be traced over an arc of 10 deg across the sky, corresponding to
a projected length of 4 kpc at the distance of the cluster. The number of
former cluster stars found in the tails adds up to about 1.2 times the number
of stars in the cluster. The radial profile of stellar surface density in the
tails follows approximately a power law r^gamma with -1.5 < gamma < -1.2.
  The stream of debris from Pal 5 is significantly curved, which demonstrates
its acceleration by the Galactic potential. The cluster is presently near the
apocenter but has repeatedly undergone disk crossings in the inner part of the
Galaxy leading to strong tidal shocks. Our results suggest that the observed
debris originates mostly from mass loss within the last 2 Gyrs. The cluster is
likely to be destroyed after the next disk crossing, which will happen in about
100 Myr. (abridged)

two rapidly rotating cool stars at several epochs, by using stellar surface
features (both cool spots and magnetic regions) as tracers of the large scale
latitudinal shear that distorts the convective envelope in this type of stars.
We also report definite evidence that this differential rotation is different
when estimated from cool spots or magnetic regions, and that it undergoes
temporal fluctuations of potentially large amplitude on a time scale of a few
years. We consider these results as further evidence that the dynamo processes
operating in these stars are distributed throughout the convective zone rather
than being confined at its base as in the Sun. By comparing our observations
with two very simple models of the differential rotation within the convective
zone, we obtain evidence that the internal rotation velocity field of the stars
we investigated is not like that of the Sun, and may resemble that we expect
for rapid rotators. We speculate that the changes in differential rotation
result from the dynamo processes (and from the underlying magnetic cycle) that
periodically converts magnetic energy into kinetic energy and vice versa. We
emphasise that the technique outlined in this paper corresponds to the first
practical method for investigating the large scale rotation velocity field
within convective zones of cool active stars, and offers several advantages
over asteroseismology for this particular purpose and this specific stellar
class.

frustrates the q=0 instabilities and supports the formation of incommensurate
charge-density waves (CDW). Upon reducing doping from half-filling and for
small electron-phonon coupling g the CDW instability first occurs in the
antisymmetric channel but both instability lines merge with increasing g. While
LRC forces always suppress the phase separation instability in the symmetric
channel, the CDW period in the antisymmetric sector tends to infinity (q_c ->

spherically trapped Bose-Fermi mixture at finite temperature in the
collisionless regime. The excitation frequencies of the condensate are
calculated self-consistently using the static Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory
within the Popov approximation. The frequency shifts and damping rates due to
the coupled dynamics of the condensate, noncondensate, and degenerate Fermi gas
are also taken into account by means of the random phase approximation and
linear response theory. In our treatment, the dipole excitation remains close
to the bare trapping frequency for all temperatures considered, and thus is
consistent with the generalized Kohn theorem. We discuss in some detail the
behavior of monopole and quadrupole excitations as a function of the Bose-Fermi
coupling. At nonzero temperatures we find that, as the mixture moves towards
spatial separation with increasing Bose-Fermi coupling, the damping rate of the
monopole (quadrupole) excitation increases (decreases). This provides us a
useful signature to identify the phase transition of spatial separation.

environment, and when acting in that environment it will frequently need to
quantify its uncertainty. For example, if the agent wishes to employ the
expected-utility paradigm of decision theory to guide its actions, it will need
to assign degrees of belief (subjective probabilities) to various assertions.
Of course, these degrees of belief should not be arbitrary, but rather should
be based on the information available to the agent. This paper describes one
approach for inducing degrees of belief from very rich knowledge bases, that
can include information about particular individuals, statistical correlations,
physical laws, and default rules. We call our approach the random-worlds
method. The method is based on the principle of indifference: it treats all of
the worlds the agent considers possible as being equally likely. It is able to
integrate qualitative default reasoning with quantitative probabilistic
reasoning by providing a language in which both types of information can be
easily expressed. Our results show that a number of desiderata that arise in
direct inference (reasoning from statistical information to conclusions about
individuals) and default reasoning follow directly {from} the semantics of
random worlds. For example, random worlds captures important patterns of
reasoning such as specificity, inheritance, indifference to irrelevant
information, and default assumptions of independence. Furthermore, the
expressive power of the language used and the intuitive semantics of random
worlds allow the method to deal with problems that are beyond the scope of many
other non-deductive reasoning systems.

observables, neither time-dependent measurements nor tagging is necessary.
Should a signal for new physics be found, one can place a lower limit on the
size of the new-physics parameters, as well as bound its effect on the
measurement of the B^0--Bbar^0 mixing phase.

probability of an intermediate pseudoscalar color-singlet $b\bar{b}$ state
(coupling to the dominant Fock state of the Upsilon via a magnetic dipole
transition) and a soft (undetected) photon; b) the annihilation width of the
$b\bar{b}$ pair into two leptons, mediated by a non-standard CP-odd Higgs boson
of mass about 10 GeV, introducing a quadratic dependence on the lepton mass in
the partial width. The process would be unwittingly ascribed to the $\Upsilon$
leptonic channel thereby (slightly) breaking lepton universality. A possible
mixing of the pseudoscalar Higgs and bottomonium resonances is also considered.
Finally, several experimental signatures to check out the validity of the
conjecture are discussed.

locally-flat knots to PL knots that are not necessarily locally-flat. We
introduce three families of generalized Alexander polynomials and study their
properties. For knots with point singularities, we obtain a classification of
these polynomials that is complete except for one special low-dimensional case.
This classification extends existing classifications for PL locally-flat knots.
For knots with higher-dimensional singularities, we further extend the
necessary conditions on the invariants. We also construct several varieties of
singular knots to demonstrate realizability of certain families of polynomials
as generalized Alexander polynomials. These constructions, of independent
interest, generalize known knot constructions such as frame spinning and twist
spinning.

for the core fragments, together with the cross sections have been measured for

perturbation theory. The projectile structure has been taken into account via
shell model calculations employing the psd-interaction of Warburton and Brown.

  rigidly deformed rotational bands","10 pages, 8 figures. Submited to PRC",,,,"nucl-th",,"  Using Chandrasekhar's S-type coupling between rotational and intrinsic
vortical modes one may simply reproduce the HFB dynamical properties of
rotating nuclei within Routhian HF calculations free of pairing correlations
yet constrained on the relevant so-called Kelvin circulation operator. From the
analogy between magnetic and rotating systems, one derives a model for the
quenching of pairing correlations with rotation, introducing a critical angular
velocity -- analogous to the critical field in supraconductors -- above which
pairing vanishes. Taking stock of this usual model, it is then shown that the
characteristic behavior of the vortical mode angular velocity as a function of
the global rotation angular velocity can be modelised by a simple two parameter
formula, both parameters being completely determined from properties of the
band-head (zero-spin) HFB solution. From calculation in five nuclei, the
validity of this modelised Routhian approach is assessed. It is clearly shown
to be very good in cases where the evolution of rotational properties is only
governed by the coupling between the global rotation and the pairing-induced
intrinsic vortical currents. It therefore provides a sound ground base for
evaluating the importance of coupling of rotation with other modes (shape
distortions, quasiparticle degrees of freedom).

the process they also perform work. Recent studies indicate that motor enzymes
perform work with specific intermediate steps in their catalyzed reactions,
challenging the classic view (in Brownian motor models) that work can only be

motor models) has emerged in which motors perform work with biochemical
transitions, but many of these models lack a solid physicochemical foundation.
In this paper, I develop a self consistent framework for chemical motor models.
This novel framework accommodates multiple pathways for free energy transfer,
predicts rich behaviors from the simplest multi motor systems, and provides
important new insights into muscle and motor function.

perturbation method of strained parameters more widely known in classical
quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry as the stationary perturbation
technique. The focus here is on the mode conversion at the points of virtual
phase matching (otherwise called anticrossings or avoided crossings) associated
with the maximum conversion efficiency. The method is shown to provide a
convenient tool to deal with intermodal interactions at anticrossings --
interactions induced by any kind of perturbation in dielectric index profile of
the waveguide, embracing optical inhomogeneity, magnetization of arbitrary
orientation, and nonlinearity. Closed-form analytic expressions are derived for
the minimum value of mode mismatch and for the length of complete mode
conversion (the coupling length, or the beat length) in generic waveguiding
systems exhibiting anticrossings. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the
method, these general expressions are further applied to the case of TE -- TM
mode conversion in (i) a multilayer gyrotropic waveguide under
piecewise-constant, arbitrarily oriented magnetization, and (ii) an
optically-inhomogeneous planar dielectric waveguide -- an example which the
standard coupled-mode theory fails to describe.

  submitted to PCCP",,"10.1039/B308813H",,"physics.chem-ph",,"  Intermolecular dynamics of highly excited DCO (X^2A') is studied from a
classical-quantum perspective using the effective spectroscopic Hamiltonian
proposed recently by Trollch and Temps (Z. Phy. Chem. 215, 207 (2001)). This
work focuses on the polyads P = 3 and P = 4 corresponding to excitation
energies E_v ~ 5100 cm^-1 and 7000 cm^-1 respectively. The majority of states
belonging to these polyads are dynamically assigned, despite extensive
stochasticity in the classical phase space, using the recently proposed
technique of level velocities. A wavelet based time-frequency analysis is used
to reveal the nature of phase space transport and the relevant dynamical
bottlenecks. The local frequency analysis clearly illustrates the existence of
mode-specific IVR dynamics i.e., differing nature of the IVR dynamics ensuing
from CO stretch and the DCO bend bright states. In addition the role of the
weak Fermi resonance involving the CO stretch and DCO bend modes is
investigated. A key feature of the present work is that the techniques utilized
for the analysis i.e., parametric variations and local frequency analysis are
not limited by the dimensionality of the system. This study, thus, explores the
potential for understanding IVR in large molecules from both time domain and
frequency domain perspectives.

then combine these results with our earlier work focusing on the role of
population II stars in galaxies with virial temperatures >10^4K at redshifts

primordial stellar sources contribute significantly to early reionisation.

star formation occurs via an accretion disk that is turbulent, initially
because of local gravitational instability, we calculate the disk structure for
realistic accretion rates. We predict that local gravitational viscosity is
able to drive accretion, without the disk fragmenting. We then estimate the
rate of dynamo amplification of seed magnetic field. Turbulence in a stratified
disk can be helical, with different signs of the helicity in each hemisphere.
This provides a key ingredient for production of global scale magnetic fields
whose sign of flux is sustained over many orbit times. The resulting fields can
drive collimated protostellar outflows that reduce the star formation
efficiency from the initial gas cloud, especially once the protostar has
contracted to the main sequence, at ~100 Msun. We estimate that the outflows
are powerful enough to eject some material from the host dark matter halo and
to initiate relatively strong magnetization of the local intergalactic medium.
Close to the protostar, the outflow acts to shield the disk and equatorial
regions from radiative feedback, such as ionizing photons, and this may enable
accretion up to relatively large stellar masses. We conclude that magnetic
fields cannot be ignored from models of primordial star formation.

properties of the baryons and address the issue of mass-to-light (M/L) ratio in
groups and clusters of galaxies. We measure a median mass-to-light ratio of 224
h70 M/L (solar) in the rest frame B_j band, in good agreement with other
measurements based on X-ray determined masses. There is no trend in M/L with
X-ray temperature and no significant trend for mass to increase faster than
luminosity: M \propto \L_{B,j}^{1.08 +/- 0.12}. This implied lack of
significant variation in star formation efficiency suggests that gas cooling
cannot be greatly enhanced in groups, unless it drops out to form baryonic dark
matter. Correspondingly, our results indicate that non-gravitational heating
must have played a significant role in establishing the observed departure from
self-similarity in low mass systems. The median baryon fraction for our sample

observation to measure the power spectrum at low frequencies. For the 3 epochs
at which we obtained Chandra/RXTE observations, the 0.5-20 keV energy spectrum
is consistent with a spectral model consisting of a power-law with interstellar

0.05 to 1.93 +/- 0.13 (90% confidence errors), indicating that the source
softens at low luminosities. The power spectra are characterized by strong
(20-35% fractional rms) band-limited noise, which we model as a zero-centered
Lorentzian. Including results from an RXTE study of XTE J1650-500 near the
transition to the low-hard state by Kalemci et al. (2003), the half-width of

spectral and timing parameters evolve with luminosity, it is notable that the
general shapes of the energy and power spectra remain the same, indicating that
the source stays in the low-hard state. This implies that the X-ray emitting

large number of cosmological parameters including a time-dependent equation of
state. With redshifts surveys combined with cosmic microwave background

doped holes reside predominantly in the plane of the bilayer. In the type A

properties in narrow gap InMnAs films and superlattices in ultrahigh magnetic
fields oriented along [001]. In n-type InMnAs films and superlattices, we find
that the e-active CR peak field is pinned at low electron densities and then
begins to shift rapidly to higher fields above a critical electron
concentration allowing the electron density to be accurately calibrated. In
p-type InMnAs, we observe two h-active CR peaks due to heavy and light holes.
The lineshapes depend on temperature and line broadening. The light hole CR
requires higher hole densities and fields. Analyzing CR lineshapes in p-films

couples to the proton. The second concerns unitarity corrections to the BFKL
equation which describes the pomeron, a Reggeon with the quantum numbers of the
vacuum.
  In the first part of this thesis, the odderon exchange contribution to
elastic proton-proton and proton-antiproton scattering is computed. A
geometrical transverse-space model of the proton is constructed to investigate
the influence of a possible diquark cluster in the proton on the odderon-proton
coupling. The average size of this cluster is determined by comparison with
experimental data. Furthermore, the validity of two odderon-proton impact
factors from the literature is tested.

vertices occur in the Generalised Leading Logarithmic Approximation used to
unitarise scattering amplitudes describing the exchange of a perturbative
pomeron. A number of basic functions of which such pomeron vertices are
composed is treated systematically in momentum and position space. Their
conformal transformation properties in impact parameter space are derived. The
vertices are expressed as a number of integrals and cast into the form of

density). The postulate that a classical ensemble is subject to nonclassical
fluctuations of the field momentum density, of a strength determined solely by
the field uncertainty, is shown to lead to a unique modification of the
ensemble Hamiltonian. The modified equations of motion are equivalent to the
quantum equations for a bosonic field, and thus this exact uncertainty
principle provides a new approach to deriving and interpreting the properties
of quantum ensembles. The examples of electromagnetic and gravitational fields
are discussed. In the latter case the exact uncertainty approach specifies a
unique operator ordering for the Wheeler-DeWitt and Ashtekar-Wheeler-DeWitt

and the fermionic condensate associated with a massive spinor field obeying the
MIT bag boundary condition on a spherical shell in the global monopole
spacetime. In order to do that it was used the generalized Abel-Plana summation
formula. As we shall see, this procedure allows to extract from the vacuum
expectation values the contribution coming from to the unbounded spacetime and
explicitly to present the boundary induced parts. As to the boundary induced
contribution, two distinct situations are examined: the vacuum average effect
inside and outside the spherical shell. The asymptotic behavior of the vacuum
densities is investigated near the sphere center and surface, and at large
distances from the sphere. In the limit of strong gravitational field
corresponding to small values of the parameter describing the solid angle
deficit in global monopole geometry, the sphere-induced expectation values are
exponentially suppressed. As a special case we discuss the fermionic vacuum
densities for the spherical shell on background of the Minkowski spacetime.
Previous approaches to this problem within the framework of the QCD bag models
have been global and our calculation is a local extension of these
contributions.

on the well-mixedness condition, in terms of the properties of a random
velocity field with second order structure functions scaling linearly in the
space time increments. This interpretation allows direct association of the
drift and noise terms entering the model, with the geometry of the turbulent
fluctuations. In particular, the well known non-uniqueness problem in the
well-mixedness approach is solved in terms of the antisymmetric part of the
velocity correlations; its relation with the presence of non-zero mean helicity
and other geometrical properties of the flow is elucidated. The well-mixedness
condition appears to be a special case of the relation between conditional
velocity increments of the random field and the one-point Eulerian velocity
distribution, allowing generalization of the approach to the transport of
non-tracer quantities. Application to solid particle transport leads to a model
satisfying, in the homogeneous isotropic turbulence case, all the conditions on
the behaviour of the correlation times for the fluid velocity sampled by the
particles. In particular, correlation times in the gravity and in the inertia
dominated case, respectively, longer and shorter than in the passive tracer
case; in the gravity dominated case, correlation times longer for velocity
components along gravity, than for the perpendicular ones. The model produces,
in channel flow geometry, particle deposition rates in agreement with
experiments.

is a consequence of functional and unitary invariance principles belonging to

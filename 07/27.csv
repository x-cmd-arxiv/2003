  Sloan Digital Sky Survey Early Data Release","23 figures, submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Cosmologically distributed compact dark matter objects with masses in the
approximate range of 0.001 to 1 solar masses can amplify the continuum emission
of a quasar through gravitational microlensing, without appreciably affecting
its broad emission lines. This will produce a statistical excess of weak-lined
quasars in the observed distribution of spectral line equivalent widths, an
effect that scales with the amount of compact dark matter in the universe.
Using the large flux-limited sample of quasar spectra from the Early Data
Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), I demonstrate the absence of a
strong microlensing signal. This leads to a constraint on the cosmological
density of compact objects of Omega_c < 0.03, relative to the critical density,
on Jupiter- to solar-mass scales. For compact objects clustered in galaxy
halos, this limit is expected to be weaker by at most a factor of two. I also
forecast the improvements to this constraint that may be possible in a few
years with the full SDSS quasar catalog.

galactic spiral structures offer synthesized and comprehensive views of nearby
disk galaxies. In the presence of a massive dark-matter halo, the density-wave
dynamics on galactic scales involves the stellar disk, the gas disk of
interstellar medium (ISM), the magnetic field, and the cosmic-ray gas (CRG). In
this paper, we explore the dynamic and electromagnetic interplay between the
magnetized ISM disk and CRG disk so that structural and diagnostic features of
optical, infrared, and synchrotron radio-continuum emissions from a spiral
galaxy can be physically understood. On timescales of galactic density waves,
cosmic rays collectively may be treated as a relativistically hot tenuous gas
fluid that is tied to the large-scale mean magnetic field in transverse bulk
motions but moves otherwise differently along the magnetic field relative to
the ISM. For both fast and slow magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) density waves in a
composite disk system of magnetized ISM and CRG, the minute CRG mass density
enhancement is phase shifted relative to the enhancement of parallel magnetic
field. Owing to an extremely small number of cosmic rays, the large-scale
magnetic field enhancement dominates in synchrotron radio-continuum emissions
(as if the CRG is almost unperturbed) for spiral structural manifestations. In
addition to the fast and slow MHD density waves, there also exists a
suprathermal MHD wave mode by which CRG adjusts itself with an effective
suprathermal sound speed close to the speed of light c.

reported. We focus on the oxygen line complex between 17 and 24 A as measured
with the RGS spectrometers. Accurate absorption column densities and emission
line fluxes are obtained. We explore several options for the geometry and
physical form of the emitting and absorbing gas. The lack of change in
ionization in the absorber despite an increase in continuum flux during the
observation restricts the high-ionization (O-K) and the low-ionization (Fe-M)
gas to distances of at least 0.5 pc and 2.8 pc, respectively, away from the
central source. Given the P-Cygni type profiles in the resonance spectral lines
and the similar velocity widths, column densities, and ionization structure
inferred separately from the emission and absorption lines, it is tempting to
relate the X-ray narrow-line emitting plasma with the X-ray absorbing gas.
Under this assumption, the scenario of dense clumped clouds can be ruled out.
Conversely, extended ionization cones (r > 10 pc) are consistent with the
observation independent of this assumption. These findings are in stark
contrast with the picture of numerous clumpy (n_e > 10^9 cm^-3) clouds drawn
recently from UV spectra, but it is consistent with the extended X-ray emission
cones observed directly in Seyfert 2 galaxies.

range yields total proton and deuteron capture rates in good agreement with
former results.

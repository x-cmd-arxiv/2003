by XMM-Newton European Photon Imaging Camera between 0.3-10 keV, is presented
here. The broadband spectrum of the source is dominated at low energies (E < 2
keV) by a strong excess of emission and by complex emission/absorption features
between 5.5-8.0 keV. The soft X-ray spectrum is consistent with ionized
absorption found by the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (Sako et al. (2001)).
We focus on the 2-10 keV spectrum which shows clear evidence for a broad,
complex FeK alpha line, previously unseen by ASCA, and for an Fe K-shell edge
detected at ~7.3-7.4 keV (rest-frame). The presence of this edge could be
explained by either partial covering or ionized/relativistic reflection models,
with the latter being preferred and with a resulting power law slope of Gamma
\~2.2. The line profile is complex, with a broad bump between ~ 5.5-6.5 keV and
a narrow emission line at ~ 7 keV, separated by a sharp drop at ~ 6.8 keV. This
profile is compatible with two possible scenarios: i) a broad, ionized and
gravitationally redshifted Laor diskline plus a narrow and ionized emission
line; ii) a broad, ionized and single Schwarzschild (double-peaked) diskline
with a superimposed narrow absorption line.

sub-degree scale CMB temperature anisotropy measured by the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We calculate the genus from the foreground-subtracted

negative and positive threshold levels and the asymmetry parameter to quantify
the deviation from the Gaussian relation. At WMAP Q, V, and W bands, the genus
and genus-related statistics imply that the observed CMB sky is consistent with
Gaussian random phase field. However, from the genus measurement on the
Galactic northern and southern hemispheres, we have found two non-Gaussian
signatures at the W band resolution (0.35 degree scale), i.e., the large
difference of genus amplitudes between the north and the south and the positive
genus asymmetry in the south, which are statistically significant at 2.6 sigma
and 2.4 sigma levels, respectively. The large genus amplitude difference also
appears in the WMAP Q and V band maps, deviating the Gaussian prediction with a
significance level of about 2 sigma. The probability that the genus curves show
such a large genus amplitude difference exceeding the observed values at all Q,
V, and W bands in a Gaussian sky is only 1.4%. Such non-Gaussian features are
reduced as the higher Galactic cut is applied, but their dependence on the
Galactic cut is weak. We discuss possible sources that can induce such
non-Gaussian features, and conclude that the CMB data with higher
signal-to-noise ratio and the accurate foreground model are needed to
understand the non-Gaussian signatures.

galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field North (HDFN) using a new technique,
_pixel-z_, that combines predictions of evolutionary synthesis models with
photometric redshift template fitting. Each spectral energy distribution
template is a result of modeling of the detailed physical processes affecting
gas properties and star formation efficiency. The criteria chosen to generate
the SED templates is that of sampling a wide range of physical characteristics
such as age, star formation rate, obscuration and metallicity. A key feature of
our method is the sophisticated use of error analysis to generate error maps
that define the reliability of the template fitting on pixel scales and allow
for the separation of the interplay among dust, metallicity and star formation
histories. This technique offers a number of advantages over traditional
integrated color studies. As a first application, we derive the star formation
and metallicity histories of galaxies in the HDFN. Our results show that the
comoving density of star formation rate, determined from the UV luminosity
density of sources in the HDFN, increases monotonically with redshift out to at
least redshift of 5. This behavior can plausibly be explained by a smooth
increase of the UV luminosity density with redshift coupled with an increase in
the number of star forming regions as a function of redshift. We also find that
the information contained in individual pixels in a galaxy can be linked to its
morphological history. Finally, we derive the metal enrichment rate history of
the universe and find it in good agreement with predictions based on the
evolving HI content of Lyman-alpha QSO absorption line systems.

into overdensities that strongly excite the cluster's g-modes. These modes damp

self-regulate their numerical resolution, i.e. the number of SPH particles; the
latter is calculated using the Jeans condition (Bate & Burkert 1997) and the
local hydrodynamic conditions of the gas. We apply our SPH with Particle
Splitting code to cloud-cloud collision simulations. Chapter 2 lists the
properties of our standard SPH code. Chapter 3 discusses the efficiency of the
standard code as this is applied to simulations of rotating, uniform clouds
with m=2 density perturbations. Chapter 4 [astro-ph/0203057] describes the new
method and the tests that it has successfully been applied to. It also contains
the results of the application of Particle Splitting to the case of rotating
clouds as those of Chapter 3, where, with great computational efficiency, we
have reproduced the results of FD codes and SPH simulations with large numbers
of particles. Chapter 5 gives a detailed account of the cloud-cloud collisions
studied, starting from a variety of initial conditions produced by altering the
cloud mass, cloud velocity and the collision impact parameter. In the majority
of the cases studied, the collisions produced filaments (similar to those
observed in ammonia in nearby Star Forming Regions) or networks of filaments;
groups of protostellar cores have been produced by fragmentation of the
filaments. The accretion rates at these cores are comparable to those of Class
0 objects. Due to time-step constraints the simulations stop early in their
evolution. The star formation efficiency of this mechanism is extrapolated in
time and is found to be 10-20%.

color of the red sequence shows an intrinsic scatter of 0.02 mag across
clusters, suggesting that either galaxies on the red sequence formed a long
time ago (z>2) or else their star formation is universally delayed with
preservation of a small spread in age formation. The latter possibility is
ruled out by the mere existence of galaxies at high redshift. While the old age
of ellipticals was already been claimed for a small heterogeneous collection of
clusters, most of which are rich ones, we found that it holds for ten to one
hundred large sample, representative of all clusters and groups detected on the
EDR-SDSS. Hence we suggest the possible universality of the color of the
galaxies on the red sequence. The observed red sequence color does not depend
on cluster/group richness at a level of 0.02 mag, while a ~0.23 mag effect is
expected according to the hierarchical prediction. Therefore, the stellar
population of red sequence galaxies is similar in clusters and groups, in spite
of different halo histories. Finally, since the observed rest--frame color of
the red sequence does not depend on environment and redshift, it can be used as
a distance indicator, with an error sigma_z=0.018. [Abridged]

the viscosity parameter and accretion rate. In particular we always find the
occurrence of the collapse of the disc: the instability develops always towards
a collapsed gas pressure dominated disc and not towards the expansion. This
result is valid for all initial configurations we tested. We find significant
convective heat flux that increases the instability development time, but is
not strong enough to inhibit the disc collapse. A physical explanation of the
lack of the expansion phase is proposed considering the role of the radial heat
advection. Our finding is relevant since it excludes the formation of the hot

enables the measurement of electron spin decoherence. We study different

in a universal way, which is reflected by power-laws in the transit-time and
velocity distributions of packets. With the use of multifractal scaling
analysis and arguments of non-extensive statistics we find that these
power-laws are compatible with super-diffusive traffic for random diffusion and
for improved local search. We are able to quantify the role of network topology
on overall transport efficiency. Further, we demonstrate the implications of
improved transport rules and discuss the importance of matching (global)
topology with (local) transport rules for the optimal function of networks. The
presented model should be applicable to a wide range of phenomena ranging from
Internet traffic to protein transport along the cytoskeleton in biological

using polarized photoluminescence spectroscopy in magnetic field. The
experiments on single CdTe quantum dots and on large quantum dot ensembles show
that by combining phonon-assisted absorption with circularly polarized resonant
excitation the spin-polarized excitons are photo-excited directly into the
ground states of quantum dots. We find that for single symmetric quantum dots
at B=0 T, where the exciton levels are degenerate, the spins randomize very
rapidly, so that no net spin polarization is observed. In contrast, when this
degeneracy is lifted by applying external magnetic field, optically created
spin-polarized excitons maintain their polarization on a time scale much longer
than the exciton recombination time. We also observe that the exciton spin
polarization is conserved when the splitting between exciton states is caused
by quantum dot shape asymmetry. Similar behavior is found in a large ensemble
of CdTe quantum dots. These results show that while exciton spins scatter
rapidly between degenerate states, the spin relaxation time increases by orders
of magnitude as the exciton spin states in a quantum dot become non-degenerate.
Finally, due to strong electronic confinement in CdTe quantum dots, the large
spin polarization of excitons shows no dependence on the number of phonons
emitted between the virtual state and the exciton ground state during the
excitation.

the preferred basis onto which the state is projected is selected out of the
macroscopic Hilbert space of the system. Detector-dominated von-Neumann
measurements are also desirable for both quantum computation and verification
of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale. The connection of these questions
to the predictions of the spin-boson modelis outlined. I propose a measurement
strategy, which uses the entanglement of the qubit with a weakly damped
harmonic oscillator. It is shown, that the degree of entanglement controls the
degree of renormalization of the qubit and identify, that this is equivalent to
the degree to which the measurement is detector-dominated. This measurement
very rapidly decoheres the initial state, but the thermalization is slow. The
implementation in Josephson quantum bits is described and it is shown that this
strategy also has practical advantages for the experimental implementation.

successful, the insights that have been achieved in the SP theory - the
integration and simplification of a range of phenomena in perception and
cognition - may be incorporated in a neural view of brain function.
  These proposals may be seen as a development of Hebb's (1949) concept of a
'cell assembly'. By contrast with that concept and variants of it, the version
described in this paper proposes that any one neuron can belong in one assembly
and only one assembly. A distinctive feature of the present proposals is that
any neuron or cluster of neurons within a cell assembly may serve as a proxy or
reference for another cell assembly or class of cell assemblies. This device
provides solutions to many of the problems associated with cell assemblies, it
allows information to be stored in a compressed form, and it provides a robust
mechanism by which assemblies may be connected to form hierarchies, grammars
and other kinds of knowledge structure.
  Drawing on insights derived from the SP theory, the paper also describes how
unsupervised learning may be achieved with neural structures and processes.

and it is, at the same time, compatible with the observations that Hebb's

magnitude of FI term and the rolling motion of the dilation. In the present
paper, we analyze the potential of $D$-term inflation in type I inspired models
and study the behavior of dilaton and twisted moduli fields. Adopting the
non-perturbative superpotential induced by gaugino condensation, the twisted
moduli can be stabilized. If the dilaton is in a certain range, it evolves very
slowly and does not run away to infinity. Thus $D$-term dominated vacuum energy
becomes available for driving inflation. By studying the density perturbation
generated by the inflation model, we derive the constraints on model parameters

up a new $1/N_c$ color expansion in the $SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory based on
this reformulation. In fact, we give the Feynman rules of the $1/N_c$ expansion
in the manifestly Lorentz covariant gauge. The Yang-Mills theory is defined on
a non-trivial vacuum where color--singlet transverse gluon pair condensations
take place by the attractive gluonic self-interactions. This vacuum
condensation provides a common non-vanishing mass for all the gluons with color
symmetry being preserved. It is shown that the auxiliary fields become
dynamical by acquiring the kinetic term due to quantum corrections. Then the
static potential between a pair of color charges is derived as a combination of
the Yukawa-type potential and the linear potential with non-vanishing string
tension. The mass of the lightest scalar glueball is calculated as the ratio to
the gluon mass. The explicit calculations are performed as a partial
resummation of the leading order diagrams for the small 't Hooft coupling.

representation in which it is expressed entirely in terms of gauge-invariant
quark and gluon fields. In a subspace of gauge-invariant states we have
constructed that implement the non-Abelian Gauss's law, this unitarily
transformed Weyl-gauge Hamiltonian can be further transformed and, under
appropriate circumstances, can be identified with the QCD Hamiltonian in the
Coulomb gauge. To circumvent the problem that this Hamiltonian, which is
expressed entirely in terms of gauge-invariant variables, must be used with
nonnormalizable complicated states that implement the non-Abelian Gauss's law,
we demonstrate an isomorphism that materially facilitates the application of
this Hamiltonian to a variety of physical processes, including the evaluation
of $S$-matrix elements. This isomorphism relates the gauge-invariant
representation of the Hamiltonian and the required set of gauge-invariant
states to a Hamiltonian of the same functional form but dependent on ordinary
unconstrained Weyl-gauge fields operating within a space of `standard'
perturbative states. The fact that the gauge-invariant chromoelectric field is
not hermitian has important implications for the functional form of the
Hamiltonian finally obtained. When this nonhermiticity is taken into account,
the `extra' perturbative terms in Christ and Lee's Coulomb-gauge Hamiltonian
are natural outgrowths of the formalism. When this nonhermiticity is neglected,
the Hamiltonian used in the earlier work of Gribov and others results.

  States",,"NeuroQuantol.6:126-139,2008",,,"quant-ph",,"  Experimental results presented in this paper supports the hypothesis on
quantum-like statistical behaviour of cognitive systems (at least human
beings). Our quantum-like approach gives the possibility to represent mental
states by Hilbert space vectors (complex amplitudes). Such a representation
induces huge reduction of information about a mental state. We realize an
approach that has no direct relation with reductionist quantum models and we
are not interested in statistical behavior of micro systems forming the macro
system of the brain. We describe only probabilistic features of cognitive
measurements. Our quantum-like approach describes statistics of measurements of
cognitive systems with the aim to ascertain if cognitive systems behave as
quantum-like systems where here quantum-like cognitive behavior means that
cognitive systems result to be very sensitive to changes of the context with
regard to the complex of the mental conditions.

formulated and solved using a dynamical algebra. This Lie algebraic approach is
very convenient for evaluating matrix elements and expectation values. It is
also shown that a dynamical invariant can be constructed. A classicalization of
the tight binding model is discussed as well as some illustrating examples of
Bloch oscillations and dynamical localization effects.

  tomographic analysis of Werner states and of Maximally Entangled Mixed States","28 pages, 13 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A novel ultrabright parametric source of polarization entangled photon pairs
with striking spatial characteristics is reported. The distribution of the
output electromagnetic k-modes excited by Spontaneous Parametris Down
Conversion and coupled to the output detectors can be very broad. It could
coincide with the full set of phase-matched excited modes, at least in
principle. In this case a relevant conditional quasi-pure output state should
be realized. By these (approximate) states realized over a full
Entanglement-Ring output distribution, the non local properties of the
generated entanglement has been tested by standard Bell measurements and by
Ou-Mandel interferometry. A novel ''mode-patchwork'' technique based on the
quantum superposition principle is adopted to synthesize in a straightforward
and reliable way any kind of mixed-states, of large conceptual and
technological interest in modern Quantum Information. Tunable Werner states and
Maximally Entangled Mixed States (MEMS) have indeed been created by the new
technique and investigated by quantum tomography. A thorough study of the
entropic and nonlocal properties of these states has been undertaken
experimentally and theoretically, by a unifying variational approach.

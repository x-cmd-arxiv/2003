(half light radius r_e, mean surface brightness <mi>_e within r_e and Sersic
index n) are derived for N~60 galaxies, and are used to study their internal
colour gradients. For the first time, we use the slopes of optical-NIR Kormendy
relations to study colour gradients as a function of galaxy size, and we derive
the Photometric Plane at z~0.2 in the K band. Colour gradients are negligible
at optical wavelengths, and are negative in the optical-NIR, implying a
metallicity gradient in galaxies of ~0.2 dex per radial decade. The analysis of
the Kormendy relation suggests that its slope increases from the optical to the
NIR, implying that colour gradients do not vary or even do become less steep in
more massive galaxies. Such a result is not simply accomodated within a
monolithic collapse scenario, while it can be well understood within a
hierarchical merging framework. Finally, we derive the first NIR Photometric
Plane at z~0.2, accounting for both the correlations on the measurement
uncertainties and the selection effects. The Photometric Plane at z~0.2 is
consistent with that at z~0, with an intrinsic scatter significantly smaller
than the Kormendy relation but larger than the Fundamental Plane.

The spectral energy distributions (SED) suggest grain growth, possibly to sizes
of a few hundred micron, but our spatially unresolved data cannot rule out
opacity as an explanation for the SED shape. Our observations show that these T
Tauri stars are still surrounded by significant reservoirs of cold material at
an age of 1-5 Myr. We conclude that the observed differences in disk mass are
likely explained by binary separation affecting the initial value. With
available accretion rate estimates we find that our data are consistent with
theoretical expectations for viscously evolving disks having decreased their
masses by ~30%.

to measure more directly the black hole properties such as its mass and spin.
Numerous models have been suggested to explain the HFQPOs and the rich

assumptions and are at times in conflict with the most recent observations. We
here propose a new, simple model in which the HFQPOs result from basic $p$-mode

show that within this model the key properties of the HFQPOs can be explained
simply, given a single reasonable assumption. We also discuss observational

make it as analytical as possible, we build our tori with vertically integrated
and vertically averaged quantities. Our investigation progresses by steps. We
first consider a local analysis in Newtonian gravity and determine the
properties of acoustic wave propagation within these objects, as well as the
relations between acoustic and epicyclic oscillations. Next, we extend the
local analysis to a general relativistic framework. Finally, we perform a
global analysis and determine both the eigenfunctions and the eigenfrequencies
of the axisymmetric oscillations corresponding to the p modes of relativistic
tori. These behave as sound waves globally trapped in the torus and possess
eigenfrequencies appearing in the simple sequence 2:3:4:..., independently of
the distribution of angular momentum considered. The properties of the modes
investigated here are in good agreement with those observed in recent numerical
simulations and could have a number of different applications. In X-ray binary
systems containing a black hole candidate, for instance, p-mode oscillations
could be used to explain the harmonic relations in the high frequency
quasi-periodic oscillations observed. In systems comprising a massive torus
orbiting a black hole, on the other hand, p-mode oscillations could be used to
explain the development or the suppression of the runaway instability.

reverse shock emission lasts longer in the observer frame, and its importance
for detection and analysis purposes relative to the forward shock increases. We
consider two different models for the GRB environment, based on current ideas
about the redshift dependence of gas properties in galaxies and primordial star
formation. We calculate the observed flux as a function of the redshift and
observer time for typical GRB afterglows, taking into account intergalactic
photoionization and Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption opacity as well as extinction by
the Milky Way Galaxy. The fluxes in the X-ray and near IR bands are compared
with the sensitivity of different detectors such as Chandra, XMM, Swift XRT and
JWST. Using standard assumptions, we find that Chandra, XMM and Swift XRT can
potentially detect GRBs in the X-ray band out to very high redshifts $z\gtrsim$
30. In the K and M bands, the JWST and ground-based telescopes are potentially
able to detect GRBs even one day after the trigger out to $z\sim$ 16 and 33, if
present. While the X-ray band is insensitive to the external density and to
reverse shocks, the near IR bands provide a sensitive tool for diagnosing both
the environment and the reverse shock component.

the standard Galactic CO-to-H$_2$ conversion applicable to Galactic disk giant
molecular clouds [GMCs]) were clearly detected throughout the taffy bridge
between the two galaxies, which, as in the more extreme case of HI, presumably
results from a head-on collision between the two galaxies. The highest CO
concentration between the two galaxies corresponds to the H_alpha source in the
taffy bridge near the intruder galaxy UGC 12915. This HII region is also
associated with the strongest source of radio continuum in the bridge, and
shows both morphological and kinematic connections to UGC 12915. The overall CO
distribution of the entire system agrees well with that of the radio continuum
emission, particularly in the taffy bridge. This argues for the star formation
origin of a significant portion of the radio continuum emission. Compared to
the HI morphology and kinematics, which are strongly distorted owing to the
high-speed collision, CO better defines the orbital geometry and impact
parameter of the interaction, as well as the disk properties (e.g., rotation,
orientation) of the progenitor galaxies. Based on the 20cm-to-CO ratio maps, we
conclude that the starburst sites are primarily located in UGC 12915 and the
H_alpha source in the bridge and show that the molecular gas in the taffy
bridge is forming into stars with star formation efficiency comparable to that
of the target galaxy UGC 12914 and similar to that in the Galactic disk.

standard evolutionary scenarios involving primordial binaries can be sufficient
to produce the UCBs in the Galactic field without requiring additional
processes associated with the dense stellar environments in the cores of
globular clusters. In contrast to previous studies we find that the majority of
the immediate progenitors of these systems consist of a hydrogen exhausted
donor with an ONeMg white dwarf. The evolution of these systems leads to the
accretion induced collapse of the white dwarf to a neutron star, which can play
an important role in the formation of a majority of Galactic UCBs. We predict
that with an increase in the number of X-ray active UCBs hosting neutron stars
by an order of magnitude, a system with a black hole accretor may be found.

these are the first HFA results to have been done for crystalline 3d transition
metals. Our approach uses a linearized muffin-tin orbital calculation to
determine Bloch functions for the Hartree one-particle Hamiltonian, and from
these obtains maximally localized Wannier functions, using a method proposed by
Marzari and Vanderbilt. Within this Wannier basis all relevant one-particle and
two-particle Coulomb matrix elements are calculated. The resulting
second-quantized multi-band Hamiltonian with ab-initio parameters is studied
within the simplest many-body approximation, namely the unscreened,
self-consistent HFA, which takes into account exact exchange and is free of
self-interactions. Although the d-bands sit considerably lower within HFA than
within the local (spin) density approximation L(S)DA, the exchange splitting
and magnetic moments for ferromagnetic Fe, Co, and Ni are only slightly larger
in HFA than what is obtained either experimentally or within LSDA. The HFA
total energies are lower than the corresponding LSDA calculations. We believe
that this same approach can be easily extended to include more sophisticated
ab-initio many-body treatments of the electronic structure of solids.

We find that in a realistic parameter range, the analysis of PCAR spectra of

(within ~3%) values of the spin polarization and the barrier strength Z larger
by ~ 0.5-0.6. We also consider the dependence of polarization values on Z, and
have shown by simple modeling that letting the superconducting gap vary as an
adjustable parameter can result in a spurious dependence of the
spin-polarization Pc on Z. At the same time we analyzed the effects of finite Z
on the apparent value of Pc measured by the PCAR technique, using a large
number of examples from both our own measurements and from the literature. We
conclude that there is a system-dependent variation in Pc (Z), presumably due

has been investigated, at low temperature (4.2 and 1.5K) and high magnetic
field (up to 13 T). The Hall bars have several different widths, and our
observations clearly demonstrate that the size of the sample influences the
heating phenomenon. By measuring the critical currents of both contact and
longitudinal voltages, as a function of the filling factor (around $i=2$), we
highlight the presence of a high electric field domain near the source contact,
which is observable only in samples whose width is smaller than 400 microns.

describe complex phenomena, the theory leads to derive a distinct analogous
force f_{x} on number sets proportional to $(\frac{\partial p_{x}}{\partial x}
)_{T}$ at an analogous system temperature T. In particular, this yields to an
understanding of the uneven distribution of integers of random sets in terms of
analogous scale invariance and a screened inverse square force acting on the
significant digits. The theory also allows to establish recursion relations to
predict sequences of Fibonacci numbers and to give an answer to the interesting
theoretical question of the appearance of the Benford's law in Fibonacci
numbers. A possible relevance to prime numbers is also analyzed.

present numerically-exact values for the mean time to reaction, as gauged by

diffusion-reaction processes involving two synchronously diffusing reactants
(two-walker case) relative to processes in which one reactant of a pair is
anchored at some point in the reaction space (one walker plus trap case) is
higher, and is enhanced the lower the dimensionality of the system. This
differential efficiency becomes larger with increasing system size and, for
periodic systems, its asymptotic value may depend on the parity of the lattice.
Imposing confining boundaries on the system enhances the differential
efficiency relative to the periodic case, while decreasing the absolute
efficiencies of both two-walker and one walker plus trap processes. Analytic
arguments are presented to provide a rationale for the results obtained. The
insights afforded by the analysis to the design of heterogeneous catalyst

open strings in an electric field, we argue that, contrary to earlier claims,
twisted sectors do contain physical scattering states, which can be viewed as
charged particles in an electric field. Correlated pairs of twisted states will
therefore be produced, by the ordinary Schwinger mechanism. For open strings in
an electric field, on-shell wave functions for the zero-modes are determined,
and shown to analytically continue to non-normalizable modes of the usual
Landau harmonic oscillator in Euclidean space. Closed strings scattering states
of the Milne orbifold continue to non-normalizable modes in an unusual
Euclidean orbifold of $\Real^2$ by a rotation by an irrational angle.
Irrespective of the formal analogy with the Milne Universe, open strings in a
constant electric field, or colliding D-branes, may also serve as a useful
laboratory to study time-dependence in string theory.

in an array of identical chaotic systems in order to improve its
synchronization. As the synchronization criterion is determined by the second
smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ of the coupling matrix, the problem is
equivalent to studying how $\lambda_2$ of the coupling matrix changes with
perturbation. In the aforementioned paper, a small percentage of the wavelet
coefficients are modified. However, this result in a perturbed matrix where
every element is modified and nonzero. The purpose of this paper is to present
some results on the change of $\lambda_2$ due to perturbation. In particular,
we show that as the number of systems $n \to \infty$, perturbations which only
add local coupling will not change $\lambda_2$. On the other hand, we show that
there exists perturbations which affect an arbitrarily small percentage of
matrix elements, each of which is changed by an arbitrarily small amount and
yet can make $\lambda_2$ arbitrarily large. These results give conditions on
what the perturbation should be in order to improve the synchronizability in an
array of coupled chaotic systems. This analysis allows us to prove and explain
some of the synchronization phenomena observed in a recently studied network
where random coupling are added to a locally connected array. Finally we
classify various classes of coupling matrices such as small world networks and
scale free networks according to their synchronizability in the limit.

intervals with a characteristic behavior of the level statistics and the

is not resolved and accordingly, the eigenfunctions are quite regular functions
and the level statistics shows Poisson-like behavior. At higher energies, the
level statistics of most systems moves from Poisson-like towards Wigner-like
behavior with increasing $g$. Investigating the wavefunctions, we find many
chaotic functions that can be described as a random superposition of regular
wavefunctions. The amplitude distribution $P(\psi)$ of these chaotic functions
was found to be Gaussian with the typical value of the localization volume
$V_{\rm{loc}}\approx 0.33$. For systems with periodic boundaries we find
several additional energy regimes, where $I_0$ is relatively close to the
Poisson-limit. In these regimes, the eigenfunctions are either regular or
localized functions, where $P(\psi)$ is close to the distribution of a sine or
cosine function in the first case and strongly peaked in the second case. Also
an interesting intermediate case between chaotic and localized eigenfunctions
appears.

commonly used method of Rabi oscillations of controlled pulse area. It is based
on the technique of Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) and therefore
it is robust against fluctuations of experimental parameters. Furthermore, our
work shows that it is in principle possible to perform quantum logic operations
via stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. This opens up the search for a
completely new class of schemes to implement logic gates.

single laser field is injected to a three-level medium which has two lower

position-dependent coherent superposition state. It is shown that by proper
choice of the position dependence of the superposition along the direction of
propagation, the incoming field can be converted completely to a new field.

based on a string of trapped ions. In our experiment, two ions are held in a
linear Paul trap and are entangled deterministically by laser pulses that
couple their electronic and motional states. We reconstruct the density matrix
using single qubit rotations and subsequent measurements with near-unity
detection efficiency. This way, we characterize the created Bell states, the
states into which they subsequently decay, and we derive their entanglement,
applying different entanglement measures.

Laser radiation which couples off-resonantly to a motional sideband of the
ion's S1/2 to D5/2 transition causes a phase shift proportional to the ion's
motional quantum state |n>. As the phase shift is conditional upon the ion's
motion, we are able to demonstrate a universal 2-qubit quantum gate operation
where the electronic target state {S,D} is flipped depending on the motional
qubit state |n>={|0>,|1>}. Finally, we discuss scaling properties of this
universal quantum gate for linear ion crystals and present numerical
simulations for the generation of a maximally entangled state of five ions.

addition to hyperentanglement, our scheme requires only linear optics and

of additional classical communication, our Bell-state measurement can be
implemented non-locally. We discuss the possible application of these results
to quantum dense coding and quantum teleportation.

suppressed by the use of a new pulse sequence. We also show that the coherence
time is then limited by mixing to other vibrational levels in the trap and by
the finite lifetime of the internal quantum states of the atoms.

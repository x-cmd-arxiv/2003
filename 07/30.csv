formation may be the sites for acceleration. We discuss here the effectiveness
of shock acceleration in the ICM, stressing that merger related shocks are
typically weak, at least for the so-called major mergers. We investigate the
implications of shock strenghts for gamma ray emission from single CG and for
their detectability with future gamma ray satellites (such as GLAST and AGILE)

HD169830b and c is between low-order mean motion resonances, 9:1 and 10:1. The
long-term integration of the coplanar configurations, conducted over 1Gyr,
reveals that the eccentricities of the companions vary with a large amplitude
about 0.4-0.5 but there is no sign of instability. The orbital parameters of
the planets resemble those of another 2-planetary system, around HD12661. Both
of them can be classified as hierarchical planetary systems. We investigate
whether these two exosystems are dynamically similar. Such similarities may be
important for finding out if the formation and subsequent orbital evolution of

We show that OVI absorption in the lowest density gas is located within ~300

provide optimal estimates of power spectra. Since such estimators require
require of order N_d^3 operations they are computationally prohibitive for N_d
greater than a few tens of thousands. Because of this, a large and
inhomogeneous literature exists on approximate methods of power spectrum
estimation. These range from manifestly sub-optimal, but computationally fast
methods, to near optimal but computationally expensive methods. Furthermore,
much of this literature concentrates on the power spectrum estimates rather
than the equally important problem of deriving an accurate covariance matrix.
In this paper, I consider the problem of estimating the power spectrum of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies from large data sets. Various
analytic results on power spectrum estimators are derived, or collated from the
literature, and tested against numerical simulations. An unbiased hybrid
estimator is proposed that combines a maximum likelihood estimator at low
multipoles and pseudo-C_\ell estimates at high multipoles. The hybrid estimator
is computationally fast, nearly optimal over the full range of multipoles, and
returns an accurate and nearly diagonal covariance matrix for realistic
experimental configurations (provided certain conditions on the noise
properties of the experiment are satisfied). It is argued that, in practice,
computationally expensive methods that approximate the N_d^3 maximum likelihood
solution are unlikely to improve on the hybrid estimator, and may actually
perform worse. The results presented here can be generalised to CMB
polarization and to power spectrum estimation using other types of data, such
as galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing.

warm and cold molecular gas in NGC 6240, which was undertaken to explore the
origin of its unusually luminous H$_2$ emission. By comparing three-dimensional
emission-line data (in space and velocity) of CO (J=2-1) in the radio and H$_2$
in the near infrared, we are able to study the H$_2$ emitting efficiency,
defined in terms of the intensity ratio of H$_2$ to CO [$I$(H$_2$)/$I$(CO)], as
a function of velocity. The integrated H$_2$ emitting efficiency is calculated
by integrating the velocity profile of H$_2$ emitting efficiency in blue, red,
and total (blue + red) velocity regions of the profile. We find that (1) both
the total H$_2$ emitting efficiency and the blue-to-red ratio of the efficiency
are larger in regions surrounding the CO and H$_2$ intensity peaks, and (2) the
H$_2$ emitting efficiency and the kinematical conditions in the warm molecular
gas are closely related to each other. A collision between the molecular gas
concentration and the external superwind outflow from the southern nucleus
seems plausible to explain these characteristics, since it can reproduce the
enhanced emitting efficiency of blueshifted H$_2$ around the molecular gas

toward us, hitting the entire gas concentration from behind. In this model,
internal cloud-cloud collisions within the molecular gas concentration are
enhanced by the interaction with the superwind outflow, and efficient and

  2001 Outburst of WZ Sagittae","8 pages, 1 figure, uses pasj00.cls, accepted for publication in PASJ",,"10.1093/pasj/55.4.841",,"astro-ph",,"  A new method for analyzing complex superhump light curves for the 2001
outburst of WZ Sagittae is proposed. The complexity arises because
intrinsically time-varying and non-axisymmetric distributions of superhump
light sources are coupled with the aspect effects around the binary orbital
phase because of its high orbital inclination. The new method can disentangle
these complexities by separating the non-axisymmetric spatial distribution in
the disk from the time variation with the superhump period. It may be called a
helical tomography of an accretion disk because it can reconstruct a series of
disk images (i.e., disk's azimuthal structures) at different superhump phases.
The power spectral data of superhump light curves of the 2001 outburst of WZ
Sge by Patterson et al.(2002,PASP,114,721) are now interpreted under a new
light based on the concept of helical tomography, and the azimuthal wave
numbers of various frequency modes are identified. In particular, a frequency
component, $n\omega_0-\Omega$, where $\omega_0$ and $\Omega$ are the orbital
frequency and a low frequency of the apsidal precession of the eccentric disk,
is understood as an $(n-1)$-armed traveling wave in the disk. A vigorous
excitation of a wave component of $\cos(2\Theta-3\omega_0 t)$ in the first week
of the superhump era of WZ Sge, where $\Theta$ is the azimuthal angle, supports
Lubow's (1991) theory of non-linear wave coupling of the eccentric Lindblad
resonance for the superhump phenomenon. This method can in principle be applied
to other SU UMa stars with high orbital inclination if light curves are fully
covered over the beat cycle.

structured afterglows with various lateral expansion rates as seen from any
vantage point. Such calculations allow for direct simulation of observable
quantities for complex afterglows with arbitrary energy distributions and
lateral expansion paradigms. A simple, causal model is suggested for lateral
expansion of the jet as it evolves; namely, that the lateral expansion kinetic
energy derives from the forward kinetic energy. As such the homogeneous jet
model shows that lateral expansion is important at all times in the afterglow
evolution and that analytical scaling laws do a poor job at describing the
afterglow decay before and after the break. In particular, I find that lateral
expansion does not cause a break in the lightcurve as had been predicted. A
primary purpose of this paper is to study structured afterglows, which do a
good job of reproducing global relationships and correlations in the data and
thus suggest the possibility of a universal afterglow model. Simulations of
structured jets show a general trend in which jet breaks become more pronounced
with increasing viewing angle with respect to the jet axis. In fact, under
certain conditions a bump can occur in the lightcurve at the jet break time. I
derive scaling relations for this bump and suggest that it may be a source of
some bumps in observed lightcurves such as that of GRB 000301C. A couple of
lateral expansion models are tested over a range of efficiencies and viewing
angles and it is found that lateral expansion can, in some cases, substantially
sharpen the jet break. I show flux surface contour maps and simulated images of
the afterglows which give insight into how they evolve and determine their
lightcurves.

investigated in some detail and found not to be a significant problem if at
least four photometric bands are available. The performance of the approach
presented here appears to exceed that of others in the literature.
  With reasonable restrictions, it is possible to determine the dust extinction
as well as the photometric redshift, provided five or more photometric bands
are available. An important result is that evolution of <A_V(z)> with redshift
is seen, with higher values than locally at z = 0.5-1.5, and lower values at z
> 2. This is consistent with current models for the star formation history of
the universe.
  Deconvolving the uv-to-ir seds into an old star and young star component
allows determination of M_* and \dot{M}_* for each galaxy, as well as z_{phot}
and A_V, provided that infrared photometric bands are available. The expected
trend of b = M_*/\dot{M}_* t_0 increasing to the past is seen. However there is
a great deal of scatter in the relation between b and sed type, showing that
the recent star-formation history is not very well correlated with the
long-term history of a galaxy.

large sample of HDF-N (2490) and HDF-S (28719) galaxies, using photometric

significant flattening of the exponential SBP of the LSB host. Such SBPs (""type
V"" SBPs, Binggeli & Cameron 1991) have rarely been detected in LSB hosts of
BCDs at optical wavelengths, where the relative flux contribution of the
starburst is stronger than in the NIR and can hide such central intensity
depressions of the LSB host. The structural properties, frequency and physical
origin of type V LSB SBPs in BCDs and other dwarf galaxies have not yet been
systematically studied. Nevertheless, their occurrence in a significant
fraction of BCDs would impose important new constraints to the radial
distribution of their stellar mass, and to the photometric fading of BCDs after
the termination of star-forming activity. Both a modified exponential
(Papaderos et al. 1996a) and the Sersic law give satisfactory empirical
descriptions for type V SBPs. However, we argue that the practical
applicability of Sersic fits to LSB SBPs of BCDs is limited by, e.g., the
extreme sensitivity of the solutions to small SBP uncertainties. Most stellar
LSB host galaxies in the sample show optical-NIR colors indicative of evolved
stellar populations with subsolar metallicity. Unsharp-masked NIR images and

understood. To investigate the features of the low-lying excited manifolds, the
intramolecular exchange interactions are calculated using density-functional
theory (DFT). With the calculated exchange parameters, the energy gap between
the S=10 ground-state and the first excited-state manifold is calculated by
diagonalization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The upper limit on the energy
gap is about 40.5 K which is likely to be overestimated due to incomplete
treatment of the Coulomb potential within DFT. It is found that there are
several S=9 low-energy excited-state manifolds above the S=10 ground-state
manifold. The magnetic anisotropy barriers for the low-lying spin excitations
are calculated using DFT. Based on the calculations, it is found that the

whose area density is allowed to deviate from its optimal (Schulman) value. The
behavior of such a surface is determined by an interplay between the
area-dependent elastic energy, the curvature elasticity, and the entropy. We
identify three different elastic regimes depending on the ratio $A_p/A_s$
between the projected (frame) and the saturated areas. We show that thermal
fluctuations modify the elastic energy of stretched surfaces ($A_p/A_s> 1$),
and dominate the elastic energy of compressed surfaces ($A_p/A_s< 1$). When
$A_p\sim A_s$ the elastic energy is not much affected by the fluctuations; the
frame area at which the surface tension vanishes becomes smaller than $A_s$ and
the area elasticity modulus increases.

so-called emergent phenomena believed to occur in certain principally planar
electronic systems. In fact, two distinctly different if inseparable tasks are
accomplished. First, a rigorous mathematical model is proposed of emergent
character, which is conceptually bonded with Quantum Mechanics while apparently
non-derivable from the many-body Schr\""{o}dinger equation. I call the resulting
conceptual framework the Mesoscopic Mechanics (MeM). Its formulation is
space-independent and comprises a nonlinear and holistic extension of the free
electron model. Secondly, the question of relevancy of the proposed ``emergent
mechanics"" to the actually observed phenomena is discussed. In particular, I
postulate a probabilistic interpretation, and indicate how the theory could be
applied and verified by experiment.
  The Mesoscopic Mechanics proposed here has been deduced from the Nonlinear
Maxwell Theory (NMT)--a classical in character nonlinear field theory. This
latter theory has already been shown to provide a consistent phenomenological
model of such phenomena as superconductivity, charge stripes, magnetic vortex
lattice, and magnetic oscillations. The NMT, which arose from geometric
considerations, has long been awaiting an explanation as to its ties with the
fundamental principles. I believe the MeM provides at least a partial
explanation to this effect.

distribution of two fractal surfaces follows power law decay in many cases and
this agrees with the Guttenberg-Richter power law. Here, we attempt to predict
the large events (earthquakes) in this model through the overlap time-series
analysis. Taking only the Cantor sets, the overlap sizes (contact areas) are
noted when one Cantor set moves over the other with uniform velocity. This
gives a time series containing different overlap sizes. Our numerical study
here shows that the cumulative overlap size grows almost linearly with time and
when the overlapsizes are added up to a pre-assigned large event (earthquake)
and then reset to `zero' level, the corresponding cumulative overlap sizes
grows upto some discrete (quantised) levels. This observation should help to
predict the possibility of `large events' in this (overlap) time series.

severely affected by finite size effects in small systems. Surprisingly,
despite the narrow spatial range where probability structure functions exhibit
multifractal scaling, we clearly verify the existence of extended
self-similarity -- a hidden infrared scaling phenomenon related to the peculiar
form of the crossover at the onset of nonmultifractal behavior. As finite size
effects get stronger for structure functions with negative orders, the
parabolic approximation for the multifractal spectrum loses accuracy. However,
by means of an extended self-similarity analysis, an improved evaluation of the
multifractal exponents is attained for negative orders too, rendering them
consistent with previous results, which rely on computations performed for
considerably larger systems.

  of Novapublications",,,,"cs.LO",,"  In this paper we adapt the definitions and results from Apt and Vermeulen on
`First order logic as a constraint programming language' (in: Proceedings of
LPAR2001, Baaz and Voronkov (eds.), Springer LNAI 2514) to include important
ideas about search and choice into the system. We give motivating examples.
Then we set up denotational semantics for first order logic as follows: the
semantic universe includes states that consist of two components: a
substitution, which can be seen as the computed answer; and a constraint
satisfaction problem, which can be seen as the residue of the original problem,
yet to be handled by constraint programming. The interaction between these
components is regulated by an operator called: infer. In this paper we regard
infer as an operator on sets of states to enable us to analyze ideas about
search among states and choice between states.
  The precise adaptations of definitions and results are able to deal with the
examples and we show that, given several reasonable conditions, the new
definitions ensure soundness of the system with respect to the standard
interpretation of first order logic. In this way the `reasonable conditions'
can be read as conditions for sound search.
  We indicate briefly how to investigate efficiency of search in future
research.

is made to infinitely extended spacial surfaces, infinite past or infinite
future. This can be obtained in terms of a functional W[f,S] of the field f on
a closed 3d surface S that bounds a finite region R of Minkowski spacetime. The
dependence of W on S is governed by a local covariant generalization of the
Schroedinger equation. Particles' scattering amplitudes that describe
experiments conducted in the finite region R --the lab during a finite time--
can be expressed in terms of W. The dependence of W on the geometry of S
expresses the dependence of the transition amplitudes on the relative location
of the particle detectors. In a gravitational theory, background independence
implies that W is independent from S. However, the detectors' relative location
is still coded in the argument of W, because the geometry of the boundary
surface is determined by the boundary value f of the gravitational field. This
observation clarifies the physical meaning of the functional W defined by non
perturbative formulations of quantum gravity, such as the spinfoam formalism.
In particular, it suggests a way to derive particles' scattering amplitudes
from a spinfoam model. In particular, we discuss the notion of vacuum in a
generally covariant context. We distinguish the nonperturbative vacuum |0_S>,
which codes the dynamics, from the Minkowski vacuum |0_M>, which is the state
with no particles and is recovered by taking appropriate large values of the
boundary metric. We derive a relation between the two vacuum states. We propose
an explicit expression for computing the Minkowski vacuum from a spinfoam
model.

findings concerning the gauge group SU(2), the effective vortex theory only

removal of the vortices from the lattice configurations yields ensembles with
vanishing string tension. SU(3) vortex matter which originates from Laplacian

system in 2+1 space-time dimensions is investigated numerically for
out-of-equilibrium initial conditions on the basis of the Kadanoff-Baym
equations including the tadpole and sunset self-energies. Whereas the tadpole
self-energy yields a dynamical mass, the sunset self-energy is responsible for
dissipation and an equilibration of the system. In particular we address the
dynamics of the spectral (`off-shell') distributions of the excited quantum
modes and the different phases in the approach to equilibrium described by
Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relations for thermal equilibrium states. The
investigation explicitly demonstrates that the only translation invariant
solutions representing the stationary fixed points of the coupled equation of
motions are those of full thermal equilibrium. They agree with those extracted
from the time integration of the Kadanoff-Baym equations in the long time
limit. Furthermore, a detailed comparison of the full quantum dynamics to more
approximate and simple schemes like that of a standard kinetic (on-shell)
Boltzmann equation is performed. Our analysis shows that the consistent
inclusion of the dynamical spectral function has a significant impact on
relaxation phenomena. The different time scales, that are involved in the
dynamical quantum evolution towards a complete thermalized state, are discussed
in detail. We find that far off-shell 1 <-> 3 processes are responsible for
chemical equilibration, which is missed in the Boltzmann limit. Finally, we
address briefly the case of (bare) massless fields. For sufficiently large
couplings $\lambda$ we observe the onset of Bose condensation, where our scheme

normalization of its kinetic term, in which rescaling into canonical one yields
large top Yukawa coupling. We pursue this novel possibility in a democratic

different from that of the other two generations. With diagonal breaking of
democratic S_3 symmetry, we show that the singular normalization for the top

growth rates in the 3-layer model tend to maximize in this region. We also
found that the size of state space available for eddy-amplitude growth tends to

insertion of the 40 and 42 residue forms of the peptide into cell membranes

insertion of the regular A-beta peptide as well as mutants causing familial
Alzheimer's disease, and find that all but one of the mutants change the
insertion behavior by causing the peptide to spend more simulation steps in
only one leaflet of the bilayer. We also find that A-beta 42, because of the
extra hydrophobic residues relative to A-beta 40, is more likely to adopt this
conformation than A-beta 40 in both wild-type and mutant forms. We argue
qualitatively why these effects happen. Here, we present our results and
develop the hypothesis that this partial insertion increases the probability of
harmful channel formation. This hypothesis can partly explain why these
mutations are neurotoxic simply due to peptide insertion behavior. We further
apply this model to various artificial A-beta mutants which have been examined
experimentally, and offer testable experimental predictions contrasting the
roles of aggregation and insertion with regard to toxicity of A-beta mutants.
These can be used through further experiments to test our hypothesis.

of applications are presented for 2D photonic crystals. The first is a
selection rule for determine the normal direction of the vacuum-photonic
crystal interface to achieve the highest attenuation effect at a gap frequency.
The second is to calculate the transmittance and reflectance for a light
incident from vacuum to an semi-infinite photonic crystal. As an example we
recalculate a system studied previously by K. Sakoda et al. and get results in
agreement with theirs.

be in NP or in MA. We prove that it lies inside QMA, the quantum analogue of
NP. This is the first non-trivial upper bound on the quantum complexity of a

  The proof relies on two novel ideas. First, we give a new characterization of
QMA, called QMA+. Working with the QMA+ formulation allows us to circumvent a
problem which arises commonly in the context of QMA: the prover might use
entanglement between different copies of the same state in order to cheat. The
second idea involves using estimations of autocorrelation functions for
verification. We make the important observation that autocorrelation functions
are positive definite functions and using properties of such functions we
severely restrict the prover's possibility to cheat. We hope that these ideas
will lead to further developments in the field.

confined in a magnetic trap. We consider an exactly soluble one-dimensional
model, with a spatially localized delta-type coupling between the atoms in the
trap and a continuum of free-particle external modes. Two important special
cases are considered for the confinement potential: the infinite box and the
harmonic oscillator. We establish that in both cases a bound state of the
coupled system appears for any value of the coupling constant, implying that
the trap population does not vanish in the infinite-time limit. For weak
coupling, the energy spectrum of the outgoing beam exhibits peaks corresponding
to the initially occupied energy levels in the trap; the height of these peaks
increases with the energy. As the coupling gets stronger, the energy spectrum
is displaced towards dressed energies of the fermions in the trap. The
corresponding dressed states result from the coupling between the unperturbed
fermionic states in the trap, mediated by the coupling between these states and
the continuum. In the strong-coupling limit, there is a reinforcement of the
lowest-energy dressed mode, which contributes to the energy spectrum of the
outgoing beam more strongly than the other modes. This effect is especially
pronounced for the one-dimensional box, which indicates that the efficiency of
the mode-reinforcement mechanism depends on the steepness of the confinement
potential. In this case, a quasi-monochromatic anti-bunched atomic beam is
obtained. Results for a bosonic sample are also shown for comparison.

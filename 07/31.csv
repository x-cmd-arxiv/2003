analyses of the WMAP first-year data, based on the power spectrum and N-point
correlation functions. We focus on large and intermediate scales (larger than
about 3 degrees) and compare the observed data against Monte Carlo ensembles
with WMAP-like properties. In both analyses, we measure the amplitudes of the
large-scale fluctuations on opposing hemispheres and study the ratio of the two
amplitudes. The power-spectrum analysis shows that this ratio for WMAP, as
measured along the axis of maximum asymmetry, is high at the 95%-99% level
(depending on the particular multipole range included). The axis of maximum
asymmetry of the WMAP data is weakly dependent on the multipole range under
consideration but tends to lie close to the ecliptic axis. In the N-point
correlation function analysis we focus on the northern and southern hemispheres
defined in ecliptic coordinates, and we find that the ratio of the large-scale
fluctuation amplitudes is high at the 98%-99% level. Furthermore, the results
are stable with respect to choice of Galactic cut and also with respect to
frequency band. A similar asymmetry is found in the COBE-DMR map, and the axis
of maximum asymmetry is close to the one found in the WMAP data.

find [Cr/Zn] = -0.45 +/- 0.13, which indicates that approx 65% of the Cr is
depleted on to grains, but this does not correct for the missed DLAs. We have
also derived Zn and Cr abundances in two kinematic regimes, and within each

metallicities are higher in the composites where the absorption has larger
velocity spreads as measured by MgII 2796 rest equivalent width. Larger
velocity spreads may correspond to deeper gravitational potential wells which
represent more massive and chemically evolved structures, and/or regions
associated with winds from starbursting galaxies, also leading to kinematically
broad structures of chemically enriched gas. Within the large velocity spread
regime, we find that at lower redshifts the Zn metallicity is larger and more
Cr is depleted on to grains.

their star formation rate (SFR). The X-ray emitting galaxies are not those with
the highest rest frame equivalent width in this emission line, but rather are
among those with the highest SFR. With SFR corrected for inclination effects,
the distant galaxies show a L(X) -- SFR relationship that is comparable to that

median SFR/galaxy stellar mass than does a sample of local star forming
galaxies. We demonstrate that the observed SFR for most of the galaxies at z~1

produce the stellar mass observed in these galaxies. A rise in SFR at still

conclusion that, once AGNs are eliminated, X-ray emission in these distantstar

approximations are made, the full equations are solved here for the
frequency-dependent radiative transport that includes the thermal motion of the
molecules. The spectral line profiles for spheres and disks are found to
rebroaden to the full thermal Doppler breadth with increasing saturation in
essentially the same way as is well known to occur for a linear maser. The
variation with frequency in the apparent angular sizes of masing spheres and
thin disks is found to be negligible at frequencies within the spectral line
where the flux is significant. Calculations also are performed for spherical
and disk masers that are not isolated, but for which the seed radiation for the
masers is incident from one side as would occur when a strong continuum source
is on the far side of the masers. Again, the spectral line profiles are found
to rebroaden to the full thermal breadths with increasing saturation and there
are no significant variations in the apparent angular sizes with frequency.
However, the full rebroadening does occur at somewhat higher saturation and the
variation of the apparent angular sizes as a function of the degree of
saturation is quite different from that of the isolated masers. Spheres and
disks have served as idealized geometries with which to examine possible
deviations from the linear approximation for astrophysical masers.

from stochastic astrophysical sources can be redistributed to biologically and
chemically important UV wavelengths, a significant fraction of which can reach
the surface. This redistribution is mediated by secondary electrons, resulting
from Compton scattering and X-ray photoabsorption, with energies low enough to
excite atmospheric molecules and atoms, resulting in a rich aurora-like
spectrum. We calculate the fraction of energy redistributed into biologically
and chemically important wavelength regions for spectra characteristic of
stellar flares and supernovae using a Monte-Carlo transport code written for
this problem and then estimate the fraction of this energy that is transmitted
from the atmospheric altitudes of redistribution to the surface for a few
illustrative cases. Redistributed fractions are found to be of order 1%, even
in the presence of an ozone shield. This result implies that planetary
organisms will be subject to mutationally significant, if intermittent,
fluences of UV-B and harder radiation even in the presence of a narrow-band UV
shield like ozone. We also calculate the surficial transmitted fraction of
ionizing radiation and redistributed ultraviolet radiation for two illustrative
evolving Mars atmospheres whose initial surface pressures were 1 bar. Our
results suggest that coding organisms on planets orbiting low-mass stars (and
on the early Earth) may evolve very differently than on contemporary Earth,
with diversity and evolutionary rate controlled by a stochastically varying

strong high excitation [OIV] line is observed which most likely originates in

powerful emission in the pure rotational lines of molecular hydrogen. We argue
that this emission is mainly due to shocks in its turbulent central gas

0822+3542 (Z=1/34 Zsun), is also one of the nearest such objects. A trigger
mechanism for its current SF burst has remained unclear. We report the
discovery of a very blue ((B-V)tot=0.08 and (V-R)tot=0.14) LSB (mu_B^0 > 23.4
arcsec^-2) dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxy, named SAO 0822+3545. Its small
relative velocity and projected distance of ~11 kpc from the BCG imply their
physical association. For this LSB galaxy, we present spectroscopic results,
total B,V,R magnitudes, the effective radii and surface brightness (SB), and we
describe its morphological properties. We compare the very blue colours of this
dwarf with PEGASE.2 models of the colour evolution of a Z=1/20 Zsun stellar
population, and combine this analysis with the data on the LSBD EW(Ha) values.
The models best describing all available observational data depend on the
relative fraction of massive stars in the IMF used. For a Salpeter IMF with Mup
= 120 Msun, the best model includes a ""young"" single stellar population (SSP)
with an age of ~10 Myr and an ""old"" SSP with the age of ~0.2--10 Gyr. The mass
ratio of the old to young components should be in the range of 10 to 30. The
role of interaction in triggering the galaxies major SF episodes during the
last ~100-200 Myr is discussed. For the BCG, based on the spectroscopy with the
6m telescope, we estimate the physical parameters of its SF region and present
the first evidence of an ionized gas supershell. This pair of dwarfs lies deep
within the nearby Lynx-Cancer void, with the nearest bright (L > L*) galaxies
at distances > 3 Mpc. This is probably one of the main factors responsible for
the unevolved state of HS 0822+3542.

Omega(H) more directly to regions containing the absorbers our values become >~

Delta(v) < 300 km/s but there is no clustering on any scale between systems. We
argue that for our sample the CIV clustering is entirely due to the peculiar
velocities of gas present in the outer extensions of galaxies. We find no
change with z in the median column density ratio SiIV/CIV, contrary to previous
observations; other ionic ratios vary continuously with redshift. We show that
these are only partial indicators of ionization state and remedy this by use of
specific pairs of ratios. We demonstrate that the majority of absorbers are
photoionized and find that at z < 2.65 QSOs dominate the ionization whereas at
z > 3.4 an additional, dominant contribution from galaxies with specific
spectral characteristics and high radiative escape fraction in the range 1-4

solving numerically the time-dependent equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
in one dimension. We examine the behaviour of the waves and find that different
physical mechanisms are relevant in different ranges of beta. In a low beta
plasma the wave may undergo a parametric decay. This is because the wave
excites a density enhancement that travels slower than the wave itself and thus
interacts with the wave. When beta is greater or equal to one the density
enhancement does not interact with the wave and no decay takes place, instead
the Alfven wave is reflected against the density enhancement. The reflection
zone propagates with the speed 1/n of the Alfven speed. Because of that the
magnetic flux is conserved which results in an amplification of the oscillating
magnetic field by a factor 1/n. We find that n depends on beta, and that in
particular it is less or equal to one for values of beta ~ 1 and is greater or
equal to one for beta >> 1. We discuss the relevance of these mechanisms to the
acceleration of the solar wind, and the triggering of MHD turbulence in the
polar wind region. In particular these simulations can explain the presence of

stellar populations, suggesting they formed at high redshift, and are expected
to host supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The recent detection of several
high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) at submm wavelengths confirms that indeed
some massive galaxies may have formed the bulk of their stellar populations in
spectacular dust-enshrouded starbursts at high-z. In this letter we compare
sensitive Chandra X-ray images - which identify actively-fueled SMBHs - and
submm observations - capable of detecting obscured activity in luminous
galaxies at high redshift - of the environments of three HzRGs. These
observations exhibit overdensities of X-ray sources in all 3 fields and a close
correspondence between the Chandra and SCUBA populations. This suggests that
both substantial star formation and nuclear activity may be occuring in these
regions. We identify possible pairs of Chandra sources with each of 2 SCUBA
sources, suggesting that their ultraluminous activity may be triggered by the
interaction of two massive galaxies, each of which hosts an accreting SMBH. The
presence of two SMBHs in the resulting remanent is predicted to produce a
flattened stellar core in the galaxy, a morphological signature frequently seen
in luminous cluster ellipticals. Hence the confirmation of pairs of Chandra
sources within individual, luminous SCUBA galaxies would provide additional
evidence that these galaxies at z~2-4 are the progenitors of the giant
elliptical galaxies found in clusters at the present-day.

and are important models of biological networks, including protein-protein
interaction networks and gene regulatory networks. Three models of graph growth
are studied: pure duplication growth, and two two-parameter models in which
duplication forms one element of the growth dynamics. A power-law degree
distribution is found to emerge in all three models. However, the parameter
space of the latter two models is characterized by a range of parameter values
for which duplication is the predominant mechanism of graph growth. For
parameter values that lie in this ``duplication-dominated'' regime, it is shown
that the degree distribution either approaches zero asymptotically, or
approaches a non-zero power-law degree distribution very slowly. In either
case, the approach to the true asymptotic degree distribution is characterized
by a dependence of the scaling exponent on properties of the initial degree
distribution. It is therefore conjectured that duplication-dominated,
scale-free networks may contain identifiable remnants of their early structure.
This feature is inherited from the idealized model of pure duplication growth,
for which the exact finite-size degree distribution is found and its asymptotic
properties studied.

correlation functions show that the non-exponential relaxation of the lithium
ions results from both correlated back-and-forth jumps and the existence of
dynamical heterogeneities, i.e., the presence of a broad distribution of jump
rates. A quantitative analysis yields that the contribution of the dynamical
heterogeneities to the non-exponential depopulation of the lithium sites
increases upon cooling. Further, correlated back-and-forth jumps between
neighboring sites are observed for the fast ions of the distribution, but not
for the slow ions and, hence, the back-jump probability depends on the
dynamical state. Four-time correlation functions indicate that an exchange
between fast and slow ions takes place on the timescale of the jumps
themselves, i.e., the dynamical heterogeneities are short-lived. Hence, sites
featuring fast and slow lithium dynamics, respectively, are intimately mixed.
In addition, a backward correlation beyond the first neighbor shell for highly
mobile ions and the presence of long-range dynamical heterogeneities suggest
that fast ion migration occurs along preferential pathways in the glassy
matrix. In the melt, we find no evidence for correlated back-and-forth motions

account.This is done by writing the excitation operators as linear combinations
of one and two HFB quasi-particles. The excitation energies and the
quasi-particle amplitudes are given by generalized Bogoliubov equations. The
excitation spectrum has two branches. The first one is a discrete branch which
is gapless and has a phonon character at large wave-length and, contrarily to
HFB, is always stable. This branch is detached from a continuum branch whose
threshold, at fixed total momentum, coincides with the two quasi-particle
threshold of the HFB theory. The gap between these two branches at P=0 is equal
to two times the HFB gap, which then provides for the relevant energy scale. We
also give numerical results for a specific case.

spin-1/2 Heisenberg model coupled to adiabatic bond phonons is studied using a
quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method. The transition from a gapless Neel state to a
spin-gapped Peierls state is explored in the parameter space spanned by the
spatial anisotropy and the strength of spin-lattice coupling. It is found that
for any finite inter-chain coupling, the transition to a dimerized Peierls
ground state occurs only when the spin-lattice coupling exceeds a finite,
non-zero critical value. This is in contrast to the pure 1D model, where
adiabatic phonons lead to a dimerized ground state for any non-zero spin-phonon
coupling. The phase diagram in the above parameter space is mapped out. No
evidence is found for a region of co-existing long range magnetic order and
dimerization. The vanishing of the Neel order occurs simultaneously with the

to reproduce the observed period, phase and the negative resistivity of the
main oscillations, but also to predict the secondary peak/valley structures
relating to two-photon and three-photon processes. The dependence of the

update their beliefs to accommodate new observations. In recent years, there
has been much work on axiomatic characterizations of belief change. We claim
that a better understanding of belief change can be gained from examining
appropriate semantic models. In this paper we propose a general framework in
which to model belief change. We begin by defining belief in terms of knowledge
and plausibility: an agent believes p if he knows that p is more plausible than
its negation. We then consider some properties defining the interaction between
knowledge and plausibility, and show how these properties affect the properties
of belief. In particular, we show that by assuming two of the most natural
properties, belief becomes a KD45 operator. Finally, we add time to the
picture. This gives us a framework in which we can talk about knowledge,
plausibility (and hence belief), and time, which extends the framework of
Halpern and Fagin for modeling knowledge in multi-agent systems. We then
examine the problem of ``minimal change''. This notion can be captured by using
prior plausibilities, an analogue to prior probabilities, which can be updated
by ``conditioning''. We show by example that conditioning on a plausibility
measure can capture many scenarios of interest. In a companion paper, we show
how the two best-studied scenarios of belief change, belief revisionand belief
update, fit into our framework.

assumptions made by each method, and to better understand the principles
underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno and Mendelzon's notion of

coupling degenerates for d<2n. On the other hand, for all d>n the sub-stack
M(d,n;2) deforms.
  We calculate the exact length of the Griffiths-Yukawa coupling over M(d,n;r),
and we construct a 4-dimensional family of quintic hypersurfaces, and a dense
set of points in the base, where the fibres have complex multiplication.

favors an antisynchronous state in which the extension of one oscillator is

phase in which the total length of the chain oscillates at a different

  1-59033-905-3",,,"quant-ph cond-mat hep-th",,"  We present a full introduction to the recent devised perturbation theory for
strong coupling in quantum mechanics. In order to put the theory in a proper
historical perspective, the approach devised in quantum field theory is rapidly
presented, showing how it implies a kind of duality in perturbation theory,
from the start. The approach of renormalization group in perturbation theory is
then presented. This method permits to resum secularities in perturbation
theory and makes fully algorithmical the resummation, transforming the
perturbation calculations in a step by step computational procedure. The
general theorem on which is founded a proper application of the strong coupling
expansion, based on a result in the quantum adiabatic theory, is then exposed.
This theorem gives the leading order of a strong coupling expansion. Then,
after the introduction of the principle of duality in perturbation theory that
puts in a proper context the quantum field theory method, the resulting theory
of the strong coupling expansion and the free picture are presented. An
algorithm for the computation of the perturbation series is finally given. This
approach has a lot of applications in fields as quantum optics, condensed
matter and so on, extending the original expectations of the quantum field
theory method. So, we give some examples of application for a class of
two-level systems that, in recent years, proved to be extremely important. One
of the most interesting concepts that can be obtained in this way is that of a
Quantum Amplifier (QAMP) that permits to obtain an amplification to the
classical level of the quantum fluctuations of the ground state of a single
radiation mode.

made by Zubko, Dwek, and Arendt (2003, ZDA03) who, for the first time, included
the average interstellar extinction, the diffuse infrared emission, {\it and}
the interstellar abundances as explicit constraints in the construction of
models consisting of astrophysical dust particles without any predetermined
functional form for their grain size distribution. The results showed the
existence of many distinct dust models that satisfy a basic set of
observational constraints.
  X-ray halos, produced primarily by small angle scattering off large dust
particles along the line of sight to bright X-ray sources, probe dust
properties largely inaccessible at other wavelengths. In this contribution we
briefly review the microscopic physics and the macroscopic effects that
determine the intensity and spatial profile of X-ray halos. Focusing on the
X-ray halo around the bright source GX~13+1, we show that halo observations can
be used to discriminate between the different, currently viable, ZDA03 dust

explicitly included in all future dust models.

the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that have nearby foreground QSOs, with proper line
of sight tangential separations of 0.50, 0.82, and 1.10 h^{-1} Mpc. We estimate
that the ionizing flux from the foreground QSO should increase the
photoionization rate by a factor (94, 13, 13) in these three cases, which would
be clearly detectable in the first QSO and marginally so in the other two. We
do not detect the transverse proximity effect. Three possible explanations are
provided: an increase of the gas density in the vicinity of QSOs, time
variability, and anisotropy of the QSO emission. We find that the increase of
gas density near QSOs can be important if they are located in the most massive
halos present at high redshift, but is not enough to fully explain the absence
of the transverse proximity effect. Anisotropy requires an unrealistically
small opening angle of the QSO emission. Variability demands that the
luminosity of the QSO with the largest predicted effect was much lower 10^6
years ago, whereas the transverse proximity effect observed in the HeII Lya
absorption in QSO 0302-003 by Jakobsen et al. (2003) implies a lifetime longer
than 10^7 years. A combination of all three effects may better explain the lack
of Lya absorption reduction. A larger sample of QSO pairs may be used to
diagnose the environment, anisotropy and lifetime distribution of QSOs.

overtone and double-mode RR Lyrae stars and non-classified variables. Special
attention has been paid to the Blazhko stars. We found altogether 731 Blazhko
variables showing either a doublet or an equidistant triplet pattern at the
main pulsation component in their frequency spectra. The incidence rate of the
Blazhko variables among the RR0 stars in the LMC is 11.9%, which is three times
higher than their rate among the first overtone RR Lyrae stars. From the
frequency spectra we found that variables with larger modulation amplitudes at
the higher frequency side of the main pulsation component are three times more
frequent than the ones showing the opposite amplitude pattern. A search made
for a modulation component with the Blazhko period in the average brightness of
the individual variables showed the existence of such a modulation with an
overall amplitude of ~0.006 mag. On the other hand, a similar search for
quadruple modulation patterns around the main pulsation component have failed
to clearly detect such components at the ~0.004 mag level. This means that the
amplitudes of the quadruple components should be, on the average, at least ten
times smaller than those of the triplet components. This finding and the
existence of Blazhko variables with highly asymmetric modulation amplitudes not
only question the validity of the magnetic oblique rotator model, but also puts
stringent constraints on models based on mode coupling theories.

semiclassical theory, supported by numerical results in a Lorentz gas model,

of the Fermi wavelength going to zero, the behavior for times longer than
Ehrenfest time, the insensitivity with respect to the form of the perturbation

elaborating a semiclassical approximation to the Wigner function, we are able

ultracold particles of alkali vapors; we present the theory describing how
their properties depend on experimentally adjustable strength of ``nuclear''
attraction and interparticle repulsion. The binding ability of the short-range
potential increases with space dimensionality - only a limited number of
particles can be bound in one dimension, while in two and three dimensions the
number of bound bosons can be chosen at will. Particularly in three dimensions
we find an unusual effect of enhanced resonant binding: for not very strong
interparticle repulsion the equilibrium number of bosons bound to a nuclear
potential having a sufficiently shallow single-particle state increases without
bound as the nuclear potential becomes less attractive. As a consequence of the
competing nuclear attraction enhanced by the Bose statistics and interparticle
repulsions, the dependence of the ground-state energy of the atom on the number
of particles has a minimum whose position is experimentally tunable. This
implies a staircase dependence of the equilibrium number of bound bosons on
external parameters which may be used to create a single-atom pipette - an
arrangement which allows the transport of atoms into and out of a reservoir,

between order and disorder that develop at this point induce profound
transformations in the finite temperature electronic properties of the
material. Magnetic fields are ideal for tuning a material as close as possible
to a QCP, where the most intense effects of criticality can be studied. A
previous study on theheavy-electron material $YbRh_2Si_2$ found that near a
field-induced quantum critical point electrons move ever more slowly and
scatter off one-another with ever increasing probability, as indicated by a
divergence to infinity of the electron effective mass and cross-section. These
studies could not shed light on whether these properties were an artifact of
the applied field, or a more general feature of field-free QCPs. Here we report
that when Germanium-doped $YbRh_2Si_2$ is tuned away from a chemically induced
quantum critical point by magnetic fields there is a universal behavior in the
temperature dependence of the specific heat and resistivity: the characteristic
kinetic energy of electrons is directly proportional to the strength of the

(weak ferromagnets) or large (strong ferromagnets) compared to the
superconducting gap. With weak ferromagnets we show the existence of a
reentrant superconducting gap for the F/S/F trilayer with atomic thickness in
the parallel alignment (equivalent to the F/S bilayer). Qualitatively small
disorder is equivalent to reducing the value of the hopping parameters. In the
presence of a finite thickness in the superconducting layer the superconducting
gap in the antiparallel alignment is larger than in the parallel alignment,
meaning that pair breaking dominates over the proximity effect.

fields propagate in the extra dimensions. Previous studies of such models have
concentrated on the Kaluza-Klein (KK) partners of standard model particles.
Here we determine the properties of the KK gravitons and explore their
cosmological implications. We find the lifetimes of decays to KK gravitons, of
relevance for the viability of KK gravitons as dark matter. We then discuss the
primordial production of KK gravitons after reheating. The existence of a tower
of KK graviton states makes such production extremely efficient: for reheat
temperature T_RH and d extra dimensions, the energy density stored in gravitons
scales as T_RH^{2+3d/2}. Overclosure and Big Bang nucleosynthesis therefore
stringently constrain T_RH in all universal extra dimension scenarios. At the
same time, there is a window of reheat temperatures low enough to avoid these

e gamma and tau --> mu gamma to accessible rates. In particular, the
non-observation of these processes in the near future would exclude the

only by reduction to the present individual bodily experience but in an
historical context as well, as far as the origins of mathematics are concerned.
Some early mathematical results are the Theorems of Geometry and arose as
attempts to objectively render the main perceptual categories such as
verticality, horizontality, similarity (or its varieties). Inasmuch as these
are of a qualitative nature, it was required that they be expressed in a
quantitative way in order to be objectified.
  The first form of this objectification occurred in the case of 'archetypal
results', namely the Pythagorean triads and the internal ratio of the legs in
the right triangles. In the next stage, a 'scientific' treatment would come
from a shift of objectification and descriptions inside an abstract theory,
which would constitute the first logicomathematical knowledge. In this theory,
the 'archetypal results' were incorporated, generalized and acquired their
unquestionable, supertemporal validity. The study presents a particular
epistemological analysis of some of the main terms used in the beginnings of
Geometrical Thought and Euclid's Elements, utilizing the theoretical apparatus
of the theory of 'embodied mathematics'. It also traces models of
objectification for the 'archetypal results' and indicates their diffusion in
later mathematical developments.

matrix can be derived from nuclear superallowed beta decays, neutron decay, and
pion beta decay. We survey current world data for all three. Today, the most
precise value of V_{ud} comes from the nuclear decays; however, the precision
is limited not by experimental error but by the estimated uncertainty in
theoretical corrections. Experimental uncertainty does limit the neutron-decay
result, which, though statistically consistent with the nuclear result, is
approximately a factor of three poorer in precision. The value obtained for
$V_{ud}$ leads to a result that differs at the 98% confidence level from the
unitarity condition for the CKM matrix. We examine the reliability of the small
calculated corrections that have been applied to the data, and assess the
likelihood of even higher quality nuclear data becoming available to confirm or
deny the discrepancy. Some of the required experiments depend upon the
availability of intense radioactive beams. Others are possible today.

that uncertainties of the extracted S17 coming from the use of the ANC method

Virtual Photon Theory (VPT). Calculation of measured spectra in dissociation
experiments is done by means of the method of Continuum-Discretized
Coupled-Channels (CDCC). From the analysis of 58Ni(8B,7Be+p)58Ni at 25.8 MeV,
S17=22.83 +/- 0.51(theo) +/- 2.28(expt) (eVb) is obtained; the ANC method
turned out to work in this case within 1% of error. Preceding systematic
analysis of experimental data at intermediate energies, we propose hybrid (HY)
Coupled-Channels (CC) calculation of 8B Coulomb dissociation, which makes
numerical calculation much simple, retaining its accuracy. The validity of the
HY calculation is tested for 58Ni(8B,7Be+p)58Ni at 240 MeV. The ANC method
combined with the HY CC calculation is shown to be a powerful technique to

existence of a low viscosity channel or layer. The uplifts observed after the
end of deglaciation does not show any contribution from this low viscosity
channel and a homogeneous viscosity model fits very well to the observed
uplift. Most of the researchers therefore prefer the homogeneous model and
suggest that the higher uplift rate before the end of deglaciation is the
result of elastic contamination. It has been shown that the elastic deformation
of the lithosphere is far too small to be responsible for the observed extra
uplift; therefore, the homogeneous viscosity model should be discredited.
  The homogeneous viscosity of the postglacial period and the high uplift rate
of the late glacial period can be explained with a model which has an upper
layer determining the homogeneous viscosity and the layer below it which has a
low viscosity. The contribution to the uplift of this low viscosity layer is
indistinguishable from an instantaneous uplift.
  Current GPS deformation measurements indicating 10^21 Pas average viscosity
for the lithosphere, which is consistent with this model. The viscosity of the
low velocity zone should be between 10^18 Pas and 10^11 Pas. The lower
constrain on the viscosity of the low velocity zone can be deduced from seismic
observations. This viscosity model is consistent with post glacial rebounds and
further supported by the lack of the dynamic topography.

axiomatic systems are developed for classical linear moment constraints, b) the
feasible set of distributions which is defined by frequency moment constraints
admits several entropy maximizing distributions (I-projections), hence
probabilistic justification of REM via Conditioned Weak Law of Large Numbers
cannot be invoked. However, REM is not left completely unjustified in this

non-linearity of X-frequency moment constraints which are used in Non-extensive

implies that maxTent does not choose the most probable distribution and that
the maxTent distribution is asymptotically conditionally improbable. What are

in various stages of the computation. For large L, they decohere at anomalously
great rates by weak noises that simulate noises in real systems. Decoherence of
some of the AFSs is fatal to the results of the computation, whereas
decoherence of some of the other AFSs does not have strong influence on the
results of the computation. When such a crucial AFS decoheres, the probability
of getting the correct computational result is reduced approximately
proportional to L^2. The reduction thus becomes anomalously large with
increasing L, even when the coupling constant to the noise is rather small.
Therefore, quantum computations should be improved in such a way that all AFSs

noises.

layer of Y-00 which can support a secure communication and a quantum key
distribution (more generally key expansion) by IMDD(intensity modulation/direct
detection) or FSK(frequency shift keying)optical fiber communication network.
Although the general proof of the security is not yet given, a brief sketch of
security analysis is shown, which involve an entanglement attack.

multi-party quantum states under local transformations. The structure of these
networks is closely related to the structure of the invariants themselves and
this lends a physical interpretation to these otherwise abstract mathematical
quantities. Specifically, our networks estimate the invariants under local
unitary (LU) transformations and under stochastic local operations and
classical communication (SLOCC). Our networks can estimate the LU invariants
for multi-party states, where each party can have a Hilbert space of arbitrary
dimension and the SLOCC invariants for multi-qubit states. We analyze the
statistical efficiency of our networks compared to methods based on estimating
the state coefficients and calculating the invariants.

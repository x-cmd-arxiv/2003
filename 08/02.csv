physical effects on the pixel correlation technique for the detection of weak
OVI absorption. At HI optical depths <= 0.3-1, the apparent OVI detections are
spurious coincidences due to HI absorption at other redshifts. In this range,
the apparent OVI optical depth is independent of HI optical depth. At larger HI
optical depths, apparent OVI optical depth and HI optical depth are correlated.
Detailed modelling is required in order to interpret the significance of this
relation. High-resolution spectra of four QSOs together with a large suit of
synthetic spectra are used to show that the detection of OVI in individual
spectra is only statistically significant for overdensities >= 5. These
overdensities are larger than would be naively inferred from the onset of the
correlation and a tight optical depth-density relation. The lower limit for the
volume filling factor of regions which are enriched by OVI is 4% at 95%
confidence. This is no larger than the observed volume filling factor of the
winds from Lyman break galaxies. Previous claims that the observed OVI
absorption extends to underdense regions and requires a universal metal
enrichment with large volume filling factor, as may be expected from population
III star formation at very high redshift, appear not to be warranted.

defined as Planck's constant times the rate of cellular space production, both
the vacuum energy and mass energy contents contribute to the expansion in the

energy, does not carry the attribute of mass and so does not gravitate. A
geometric derivation of the vacuum energy expansion rate was followed by a
second derivation in terms of the evolution of the contents, from radiation to
matter to dark mass (not matter). With a new definition of cosmic time, the
second derivation was shown to produce exactly the same expansion rate. Free of
singularities and inflation, both derivations also produced reasonable values
of the cosmological parameters and the second derivation produced a good fit to
the supernova Ia data with no acceleration of the expansion rate.

abundance of 0.32-0.40 +/-0.13 solar. The systematic uncertainties, arising
from calibration and model uncertainties, of the temperature determination are
nearly the same size as the statistical uncertainties. We discuss the effects
of the ACIS absorption correction on the spectral fitting. The effects of
statistics and fitting assumptions of 2-D models for the X-ray surface
brightness are thoroughly explored. This cluster appears to be elongated and so
we quantify the effects of assuming an ellipsoidal gas distribution on the gas
mass and the total gravitating mass estimates. These data are also jointly fit
with previous S-Z observations to obtain an estimate of the cluster's distance
assuming spherical symmetry. If we, instead, assume a Hubble constant, the
X-ray and S-Z data are used together to test the consistency of an ellipsoidal
gas distribution and to weakly constrain the intrinsic axis ratio. The mass
derived from the X-ray data is consistent with the weak lensing and optical
masses. We confirm that this cluster is very hot and massive, further
supporting the conclusion of previous analyses that the universe has a low
matter density and that cluster properties, including iron abundances, have not

galaxy just below the nucleus. In this paper, we argue that this dust lane is
responsible for the observed reddening of the nuclear emission and the Fe I
edge hinted at in the Chandra spectrum of MCG-6-30-15. We further suggest that
the gas within the dust lane can comprise much of the low ionization component
(i.e., the one contributing the O VII edge) of the observed warm absorber.
Moreover, placing the warm absorbing material at such distances (hundreds of
pc) can account for the small outflow velocities of the low ionization
absorption lines as well as the constancy of the O VIII edge. Photoionization
models of a dusty interstellar gas cloud (with a column appropriate for the
reddening toward MCG-6-30-15) using a toy Seyfert 1 spectral energy
distribution show that it is possible to obtain a significant O VII edge
(\tau~0.2) if the material is ~150 pc from the ionizing source. For
MCG-6-30-15, such a distance is consistent with the observed dust lane. The
current data on MCG-6-30-15 is unable to constrain the dust composition within
the warm absorber. Astronomical silicate is a viable candidate, but there are
indications of a very low O abundance in the dust, which is inconsistent with a
silicate origin. If true, this may indicate that there were repeated cycles of
grain destruction and growth from shocks in the interstellar medium of
MCG-6-30-15. Pure iron grains are an unlikely dust constituent due to the limit
on their abundance in the Galaxy, yet they cannot be ruled out. The high column
densities inferred from the highly ionized zone of the warm absorber implies
that this gas is dust-free.

theoretical yields of Pop III SNe cannot explain the trends in the abundance
ratios among iron-peak elements (Mn, Co, Ni, Zn)/Fe as well as the large C/Fe
ratio observed in certain EMP stars with [Fe/H] <~ -2.5. In the present paper,
we show that if we introduce higher explosion energies and mixing-fallback in
the core-collapse SN models of M ~ 20 - 130 Msun, the above abundance features
of both typical and C-rich EMP stars can be much better explained. We suggest
that the abundance patterns of the [Fe/H] ~ -2.5 stars correspond to supernova
yields with normal explosion energies, while those of the carbon un-enhanced
([C/Fe] < 1) stars with [Fe/H] =~ -4 ~ - 3 correspond to high-energy supernova
yields. The abundance patterns of the C-rich ([C/Fe]>~ 2) and low [Fe/H] (=~ -5
\~ -3.5) stars can be explained with the yields of faint SNe that eject little
56Ni as observed in SN1997D. In the supernova-induced star formation model, we
can qualitatively explain why the EMP stars formed by the faint or energetic
supernovae have lower [Fe/H] than the EMP stars formed by normal supernovae. We
also examine how the abundance ratios among iron-peak elements depend on the
electron mole fraction Ye, and conclude that a large explosion energy is still
needed to realize the large Co/Fe and Zn/Fe ratios observed in typical EMP
stars with [Fe/H] <~ -3.5.

Such a chain models several proposed types of a quantum computer. The chain

cause decay of an excitation localized on the defect. We find that destructive

paper proposes a simplified geometrical distortion modeling method by using two

simplified geometric distortion models is proposed, which are either simple
polynomials or the rational functions of polynomials. Analytical geometric
undistortion is possible using two of the distortion functions discussed in

models always perform better than their radial distortion counterparts.

join is cache-efficient and at the same time DPG join avoids the need for

effective coupling of the right-handed bottom quark to the neutral weak gauge

Model. Such a large discrepancy may be the result of a mixing of the bottom
quark with heavy mirror fermions with masses of the order of the weak scale. To
be consistent with the precision electroweak data, the minimal extension of the

affected by supergravity corrections, which introduce an effective mass
proportional to the Hubble parameter. We also consider that the curvaton
potential may be dominated by a quartic or by a non-renormalizable term. We
find analytic solutions for the curvaton's evolution for all these
possibilities. In particular, we show that, in all the above cases, the
curvaton's density ratio with respect to the background density of the Universe
decreases. Therefore, it is necessary that the curvaton decays only after its
potential becomes dominated by the quadratic term, which results in (Hubble
damped) sinusoidal oscillations. In the case when a non-renormalizable term
dominates the potential, we find a possible non-oscillatory attractor solution
that threatens to erase the curvature perturbation spectrum. Finally, we study
the effects of thermal corrections to the curvaton's potential and show that,
if they ever dominate the effective mass, they lead to premature thermalization
of the curvaton condensate. To avoid this danger, a stringent bound has to be
imposed on the coupling of the curvaton to the thermal bath.

compute the Casimir energy density of configurations where the background field

density and the force between two Dirac spikes as a function of the strength

A 70, 010301(R) (2004)","10.1103/PhysRevA.70.010301",,"quant-ph",,"  We show that intrinsic fluctuations in system control parameters impose
limits on the ability of two-qubit (exchange) Hamiltonians to generate
entanglement starting from mixed initial states. We find three classes for
Gaussian and Laplacian fluctuations. For the Ising and XYZ models there are
qualitatively distinct sharp entanglement-generation transitions, while the
class of Heisenberg, XY, and XXZ Hamiltonians is capable of generating
entanglement for any finite noise level. Our findings imply that exchange
Hamiltonians are surprisingly robust in their ability to generate entanglement
in the presence of noise, thus potentially reducing the need for quantum error
correction.

  between degenerate states","24 pages, 6 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We find conditions required to achieve complete population transfer, via
coherent population trapping, from an initial state to a designated final state
at a designated time in a degenerate $n$-state atom, where transitions are
caused by an external interaction. In systems with degenerate states there is
no time ordering. Analytic expressions have been found for transition
probabilities in a degenerate $n$-state atom interacting with a strong external
field that gives a common time dependence to all of the transition matrix
elements. Except for solving a simple $n^{th}$ order equation to determine
eigenvalues of dressed states, the method is entirely analytic. These
expressions may be used to control electron populations in degenerate $n$-state
atoms. Examples are given for $n=2$ and $n=3$.

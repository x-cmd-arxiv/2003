  Comparison","12 pages, 15 figures, submitted to ApJ",,,"LA 02-5870","astro-ph",,"  We have used the two IRAS redshift surveys, 1.2-Jy (Fisher et al 1995) and
PSCz (Saunders et al 2000), to model the linear velocity fields within a
redshift of 8,000 km/s and have compared them in redshift space. The two
velocity fields only differ significantly in their monopole components. The
monopole discrepancy cannot be solely ascribed to shot-noise errors and
incomplete sky coverage. The mismatch seems to arise from incompleteness of the
PSCz catalog at fluxes $\le$ 1.2 Jy. The 1.2-Jy and PSCz higher order velocity
multipoles, particularly the dipole and quadrupole components, appear to be
consistent, suggesting that the dipole residuals found by Davis, Nusser and
Willick (1996) when comparing 1.2-Jy and MarkIII velocity fields probably
originates from the MarkIII velocities calibration procedure rather than from
uncertainties in the model velocity field. Our results illustrate the
efficiency of the spherical harmonics decomposition techniques in detecting
possible differences between real and model velocity fields. Similar analyses
shall prove to be very useful in the future to test the reliability of next
generation model velocity fields derived from new redshift catalogs like 2dFGRS
(Colless et al 2001), SDSS (York et al 2000), 6dF and 2MRS.

show that the transient spectrum remained statistically achromatic from day 2.7
to day 5.6, during a re-brightening episode. Associating the light in these
early epochs with the GRB afterglow, we infer a modest level of extinction due
to the host galaxy in the line--of--sight toward the GRB: A_V(host) = 0.30 +/-
0.03 mag for beta = -0.5 and A_V(host) < 0.4 mag (3 sigma) for any physically
plausible value of beta (with flux f_nu ~ lambda^-beta). We conclude that the
spectral slope of the afterglow component was more than beta = -0.8 between day
2.7-5.6 after the GRB, excluding the possibility that the synchrotron cooling
break passed through the optical/IR bandpass over that period. Taking
extinction into account, a decomposition of the light curve into an afterglow
and supernova component requires the presence of a supernova similar to that of
SN 1998bw, an afterglow that shows some evidence for a second break around day
8-10, and a fifth re-brightening event around day 15. Assuming an SN
1988bw-like evolution and a contemporaneous GRB and SN event, the peak SN
brightness was M_V = -19.8 +/- 0.4 - 5 log h_65 mag.

X-ray binaries for which there exist good X-ray flux measurements at the time
of the transition, good distance estimates, and good mass estimates for the
compact star. We show that the state transition luminosities are at about 1-4%
of the Eddington rate, markedly smaller than those typically quoted in the
literature, with a mean value of 2%. Only the black hole candidate GRO
J~1655-40 and the neutron star systems Aql X-1 and 4U 1728-34 have measured
state transition luminosities inconsistent with this value at the 1$\sigma$
level. GRO J~1655-40, in particular, shows a state transition luminosity below
the mean value for the other sources at the $4\sigma$ level. This result,
combined with the known inner disk inclination angle (the disk is nearly
parallel to the line of sight) from GRO J~1655-40's relativistic jets suggest
that the hard X-ray emitting region in GRO J~1655-40 can have a velocity of no
more than about $\beta=0.68$, with a most likely value of about $\beta=0.52$,
and a minimum speed of $\beta=0.45$, assuming that the variations in state
transition luminosities are solely due to relativistic beaming effects. The
variance in the state transition luminosities suggests an emission region with
a velocity of $\sim0.2c$. The results are discussed in terms of different
emission models for the low/hard state. We also discuss the implications for
measuring the dimensionless viscosity parameter $\alpha$. We also find that if
its state transitions occur at typical luminosities, then GX 339-4 is likely to
be at a distance of at least 7.6 kpc, much further than typically quoted
estimates.

temperature (1.37$\pm$0.01 keV) and velocity dispersion ($\sim$ 300 km
s$^{-1}$), the NGC 1550 group is one of the most luminous known galaxy groups
(L$_{\rm bol}$ = 1.65$\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ within 200 kpc, or 0.2 \rv).
We find that within $\sim 60$ kpc, where the gas cooling time is less than a
Hubble time, the gas temperature decreases continuously toward the center,
implying the existence of a cooling core. The temperature also declines beyond
$\sim$ 100 kpc (or 0.1 \rv). There is a remarkable similarity of the
temperature profile of NGC 1550 with those of two other 1 keV groups with
accurate temperature determination. The temperature begins to decline at 0.07 -
0.1 \rv, while in hot clusters the decline begins at or beyond 0.2 \rv. Thus,
there are at least some 1 keV groups that have significantly different
temperature profiles from those of hot clusters, which may reflect the role of
non-gravitational processes in ICM/IGM evolution. NGC 1550 has no isentropic
core in its entropy profile, in contrast to the predictions of `entropy-floor'
simulations. We compare the scaled entropy profiles of three 1 keV groups
(including NGC 1550) and three 2 - 3 keV groups. The scaled entropy profiles of
1 keV groups show much larger scatter than those of hotter systems, which
implies varied pre-heating levels. We also discuss the mass content of the NGC
1550 group and the abundance profile of heavy elements.

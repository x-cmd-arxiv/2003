they exert on their surrounding protostellar disks are sufficient to open gaps
in the face of disk viscosity, thereby shutting off any further accretion. In
sufficiently well-ionized disks, the predominant form of disk viscosity
originates from the Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI) that drives
hydromagnetic disk turbulence. In the region of sufficiently low ionization
rate -- the so-called dead zone -- turbulence is damped and we show that lower
mass planets will be formed. We considered three ionization sources (X-rays,
cosmic rays, and radioactive elements) and determined the size of a dead zone
for the total ionization rate by using a radiative, hydrostatic equilibrium
disk model developed by Chiang et al. (2001). We studied a range of surface
mass density (Sigma_{0}=10^3 - 10^5 g cm^{-2}) and X-ray energy (kT_{x}=1 - 10
keV). We also compared the ionization rate of such a disk by X-rays with cosmic
rays and find that the latter dominate X-rays in ionizing protostellar disks
unless the X-ray energy is very high (5 - 10 keV). Among our major conclusions
are that for typical conditions, dead zones encompass a region extending out to
several AU -- the region in which terrestrial planets are found in our solar
system. Our results suggest that the division between low and high mass planets
in exosolar planetary systems is a consequence of the presence of a dead zone
in their natal protoplanetary disks. We also find that the extent of a dead
zone is mainly dependent on the disk's surface mass density. Our results
provide further support for the idea that Jovian planets in exosolar systems
must have migrated substantially inwards from their points of origin.

extrapolated from the emission-line luminosities. The majority of the quasars
have masses in the range $M_{\rm BH} \approx 10^8-10^9$ solar mass. Their
accretion rates, $\dot M \approx 0.01-1$ times the Eddington rate, suggest that
most of the objects possess standard optically thick, geometrically thin
accretion disks, in some cases perhaps accompanied by an optically thin
advection-dominated component. The coexistence of strong radio emission and a
standard disk conflicts with recent models for jet formation. We discuss
modifications of the standard model that can resolve this discrepancy. We find
there is a strong correlation between the accretion rate and the extended radio
luminosity. This lends support to the idea that the extended radio emission is
somehow linked to the accretion disk. Lastly, we combine the present sample of
radio-loud quasars with the sample of BL Lac objects to reevaluate the
unification picture for radio-loud AGNs. Consistent with current ideas for the
unification of radio-loud sources, we find that flat-spectrum radio quasars and
FR II radio galaxies indeed seem to belong to the same population, as do BL
Lacs and FR I radio galaxies on the opposite end of the luminosity spectrum.
However, some members of the low frequency-peaked BL Lac objects may be more
closely associated with FR II rather than FR I radio galaxies. We describe how
the various subclasses of radio-loud sources can be viewed as a continuous

Chandra and the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) in November 2001. We found an
optical/X-ray phase-shift in the periodic modulation of about 0.5, strongly
favoring the existance of two distinct emission regions in the two bands (for
the pulsed fluxes). The Chandra data allow us to study, for the first time, the
spectral continuum of RX J0806.3+1527 in soft X-rays. This was well fitted by a
blackbody spectrum with kT about 65eV and hydrogen column density of N_H about
5 x 10^20 cm^-2. The average (unabsorbed) source 0.1-2.5 keV luminosity during
the modulation-on is L_X about 5 x 10^32 erg s^-1 (assuming a distance of
500pc). Such a value is lower than the luminosity expected if stable mass
transfer between two white dwarfs were driven by gravitational radiation.
Evidence for absorption-like features are present in the phase-averaged
spectrum at about 0.53, 0.64, and 1.26 keV, which may be attributed to heavy
elements (C and N). We compare and discuss these findings with other binary
systems hosting an accreting white dwarf.

phase-dependent, and controlled by an interface Andreev bound state below the
continuum. For high transparency barriers the formation of a low-energy bound
state, when the phase is tuned to $\phi=\pi$, leads to a reduction of the heat
current relative to that for $\phi=0$. For low-transparency barriers, a shallow
Andreev bound state just below the continuum edge is connected with resonant
transmission of quasiparticles for energies just above the gap edge, and leads

consist of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons which are coupled by feedforward couplings.
Applying single spikes to the network with input-time jitters whose
root-mean-square (RMS) value and the spatial correlation are $\sigma_I$ and
$s_I$, respectively, we have calculated the RMS value ($\sigma_{Om}$) and the
correlation ($s_{Om}$) of jitters in output-firing times on each layer $m$. For
all-to-all feedforward couplings, $s_{Om}$ gradually grows to a fairly large
value as spikes propagate through the layer, even for inputs without the

value of 01-0.3, we have to take into account noises and more realistic
feedforward couplings. Model calculations including local feedforward
connection besides all-to-all feedforward couplings in multilayers subject to
white noises, have shown that in a long multilayer, $\sigma_{Om}$ and $s_{Om}$
converge to fixed-point values which are determined by model parameters

that fairly flexible and compressible charged stripes can adjust themselves to

compute energetics and spectra of real strongly--correlated materials using
methods, algorithms and computer programs of the electronic structure theory of

functional of a local electronic Green function which is probed in the region
of interest. Since we have a variety of notions of locality in our formulation,
our method is manifestly basis--set dependent. However, it produces the exact
total energy and local excitational spectrum provided that the exact functional
is extremized. The self--energy of the theory appears as an auxiliary mass
operator similar to the introduction of the ground--state Kohn--Sham potential
in density functional theory. It is automatically short--ranged in the same
region of Hilbert space which defines the local Green function. We exploit this
property to find good approximations to the functional. For example, if
electronic self--energy is known to be local in some portion of Hilbert space,
a good approximation to the functional is provided by the corresponding local
dynamical mean--field theory. A simplified implementation of the theory is
described based on the linear muffin--tin orbital method widely used in
electronic strucure calculations. We demonstrate the power of the approach on
the long--standing problem of the anomalous volume expansion of metallic

dominated by a power-law in frequency, typical of materials with localized
hopping charge carriers, in contrast to the Debye-like response of the bulk
material. The film conductivity decreases with annealing in oxygen, and it
suggests that oxygen deficit is a cause of the relatively high film
conductivity. With increase of the oxygen content, the room temperature
frequency response of the CCTO thin films changes from the response indicating
the presence of some relatively low conducting capacitive layers to purely
power law, and then towards frequency independent response with a relative
dielectric constant $\epsilon'\sim10^2$. The film conductance and dielectric
response decrease upon decrease of the temperature with dielectric response
being dominated by the power law frequency dependence. Below $\sim$80 K, the
dielectric response of the films is frequency independent with $\epsilon'$
close to $10^2$. The results provide another piece of evidence for an
extrinsic, Maxwell-Wagner type, origin of the colossal dielectric response of

the former case, the standard QCD-sum-rules result is reproduced, while the

very short strings (whose length has the scale of the lattice spacing), and
consequently the short-range linear potential (if it exists) cannot violate the

Super-Heavy X particle (with masses up to the grand unification scale ~ 10^16
GeV and possibly beyond), and the computer code I developed to model this

framework for this work is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM).
The results are presented in the form of fragmentation functions of any
(s)particle of the MSSM into any final stable particle (proton, photon,
electron, three types of neutrino, lightest superparticle LSP) at a virtuality
Q = M_X, over a scaled energy range x = 2E/M_X in [10^{-13}, 1]. At very low x
values, color coherence effects have been taken into account through the
Modified Leading Log Approximation (MLLA). The whole process is explicitely
shown to conserve energy with a numerical accuracy up to a few part per mille,
which allows to make quantitative predictions for any N-body decay mode of any
X particle. I then apply the results to the old - and yet unsolved - problem of
Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). In particular, I provide quantitative
predictions of generic ``top-down'' models for the neutrino and neutralino
fluxes which could be observed in the next generation of detectors.

(In modern language, Schwarzschild was disturbed by the non-local correlations
enforced by S^3 geometry.) Thus, what we today call ""de Sitter space"" would not
have been accepted as such by de Sitter. There is no real basis within
classical cosmology for preferring S^3 to RP^3, but the general feeling appears
to be that the distinction is in any case of little importance. We wish to
argue that, in the light of current concerns about the nature of de Sitter
space, this is a mistake. In particular, we argue that the difference between
""dS(S^3)"" and ""dS(RP^3)"" may be very important in attacking the problem of
understanding horizon entropies. In the approach to de Sitter entropy via

picture for dominant null trajectories of strings in the limit of large angular

from velocity to velocity, velocity to magnetic, magnetic to velocity, and

also found that for kinetic-energy dominated MHD fluid, there is a preferential
shell-to-shell energy transfer from kinetic to magnetic energy; the transfer is
reversed for magnetic-energy dominated MHD fluid. This property is the reason
for the asymptotic value of Alfven ratio to be close to 0.5. The analytical
results are in close agreement with recent numerical results. When magnetic and
kinetic helicities are turned on, the helical contributions are opposite to the
corresponding nonhelical contributions. The helical energy transfers have
significant nonlocal components.

is re-examined and a new model is developed by considering explicit two-pion
exchange and the $f_2$ tensor meson exchange. The $f_2$ exchange model, which
is motivated by the low energy proton-proton elastic scattering, is constructed
by fully taking into account of the tensor structure of the $f_2$ meson
interactions. Phenomenological informations together with tensor meson
dominance and vector meson dominance assumptions are used to estimate the $f_2$
meson's coupling constants. For $2\pi$ exchange, the loop terms including
intermediate $\pi N$ and $\omega N$ channels are calculated using the coupling
constants determined from the study of pion photoproduction. It is found that
our model with $f_2$ and $2\pi$ exchanges can successfully replace the commonly
used $\sigma$ exchange model that suffers from the big uncertainty of the
coupling constants. We found that the two models can be distinguished by
examining the single and double spin asymmetries.

of constraints from pion-nucleon scattering and has been successfully applied
to peripheral nucleon-nucleon partial waves. We now consider low partial waves
in the non-perturbative regime, where the regularized Lippmann-Schwinger
equation has to be solved in order to generate the bound and scattering states.
We observe an improved description of most of the phase shifts when going from
next-to- to next-to-next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion. We also find
a good description of the deuteron properties. In addition, the new cut-off
scheme allows to avoid the presence of unphysical deeply bound states. We
discuss the cut-off dependence of the four-nucleon low-energy constants and
show that their numerical values can be understood in terms of resonance
saturation. This connects the effective field theory approach to boson exchange
phenomenology.

bipartite entanglement is straightforward, as it is the synthesis of densities
having positive partial transposes between desired qubits. In addition, finding
explicit mixtures for families of separable states becomes a feasible issue for

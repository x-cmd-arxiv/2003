construct principal component based statistics, which are orthogonal to
cosmological parameters including the initial amplitude and tilt of the

statistics resemble Fourier modes confined to the acoustic regime and
ultimately can yield ~50 independent measurements of the power spectrum
features to percent level precision. They are straightforwardly related to more
traditional parameterizations such as the the running of the tilt and in the

cluster (GC) system of the edge-on Sab spiral NGC7814. This is the first spiral
to be fully analyzed from our survey of the GC systems of a large sample of
galaxies beyond the Local Group. NGC7814 is of particular interest because a
previous study estimated that it has 500-1000 GCs, giving it the largest
specific frequency (S_N) known for a spiral. Understanding this galaxy's GC
system is important in terms of our understanding of the GC populations of
spirals in general and has implications for the formation of massive galaxies.
We observed the galaxy in BVR filters with the WIYN 3.5-m telescope, and used
image classification and three-color photometry to select GC candidates. We
also analyzed archival HST WFPC2 images of NGC7814, both to help quantify the
contamination level of the WIYN GC candidate list and to detect GCs in the
inner part of the galaxy halo. Combining HST data with high-quality
ground-based images allows us to trace the entire radial extent of this
galaxy's GC system and determine the total number of GCs directly through
observation. We find that rather than being an especially high-S_N spiral,
NGC7814 has <200 GCs and S_N ~ 1, making it comparable to the two most
well-studied spirals, the Milky Way and M31. We explore the implications of
these results for models of the formation of galaxies and their GC systems. The
initial results from our survey suggest that the GC systems of typical
ellipticals can be accounted for by the merger of two or more spirals, but that
for highly-luminous ellipticals, additional physical processes may be needed.

of the polarized CO emission is over a more extended region than the dust

magnetic field direction in DR21(OH) is parallel to the CO polarization and
therefore parallel to the major axis of DR21(OH). The strong correlation
between the CO and dust polarization suggests that magnetic fields are
remarkably uniform throughout the envelope and the cores. The dispersion in

half Earth's masses up to one Jupiter's mass, and we take into account
physically realistic gravitational potentials of forming planets. In order to
calculate accurately the gravitational torques exerted by disk material and to
investigate the accretion process onto the planet, the flow dynamics has to be
thoroughly resolved on long as well as short length scales. We achieve this
strict resolution requirement by applying a nested-grid refinement technique
which allows to greatly enhance the local resolution. Our results from
altogether 51 simulations show that for large planetary masses, approximately
above a tenth of the Jupiter's mass, migration rates are relatively constant,
as expected in type II migration regime and in good agreement with previous
two-dimensional calculations. In a range between seven and fifteen Earth's
masses, we find a dependency of the migration speed on the planetary mass that
yields time scales considerably longer than those predicted by linear
analytical theories. This property may be important in determining the overall
orbital evolution of protoplanets. The growth time scale is minimum around
twenty Earth-masses, but it rapidly increases for both smaller and larger mass
values. Significant differences between two- and three-dimensional calculations
are found in particular for objects with masses smaller than ten Earth-masses.
We also derive an analytical approximation for the numerically computed mass
growth rates.

information inferred from high-energy spectra. It is required that the spectral
energy distribution consist of thermal and Comptonized components. One can
then, in principle, infer the depth of the gravitational potential well for
sources of known distance. The thermal component is inferred by the integration
of a blackbody spectral form over the disk. We assume that the color
temperature distribution in the disk has a specific shape given by the
Shakura-Sunyaev (1973) disk model which goes to zero at the inner disk radius
and at infinity and has a maximum at 4.2 Schwarzchild radii. In this
formulation there is only one parameter, the so called color correction factor,
relating the apparent temperature to effective temperature which characterizes
the thermal emission component. We have made use of improved Galactic black
hole binary dynamical mass determinations to derive, in effect, an empirical
calibration of this factor. We then present our analysis of observational data
for representative objects of several classes; Galactic black hole X-ray
binaries, narrow line Seyfert galaxies (NLS1), and ``ultra-luminous''
extragalactic X-ray sources (ULX). We then apply our mass determination
calculation and present our results. We argue that this approach can
potentially fill a void in the current knowledge of NLS1 and ULX properties,
and discuss how a deeper understanding of both classes has relevance to the
broader issues of how cosmic black holes, beyond the stellar-mass realm, are
formed and what is their overall mass distribution.

very high Doppler shifts and high temperature plasma visible in the [Fe XVIII]

July and 24 August 2002 associated with X-class flares. We determine the
physical parameters of the pre-CME streamers and discuss the geometrical and
physical nature of the streamer blowouts. In the 21 April event, the hot plasma
seen as [Fe XVIII] is not related to the structure seen in [Fe XXI] by SUMER at
lower heights. It has the form of a rapidly expanding fan, quite likely a

  Letters","Astrophys.J.594:L103,2003","10.1086/378766",,"astro-ph",,"  Existing radio images of a few X-shaped radio galaxies reveal Z-symmetric
morphologies in their weaker secondary lobes which cannot be naturally
explained by either the galactic merger or radio-lobe backflow scenarios, the
two dominant models for these X-shaped radio sources. We show that the merger
picture can explain these morphologies provided one takes into account that,
prior to the coalescence of their supermassive black holes, the smaller galaxy
releases significant amounts of gas into the ISM of the dominant active galaxy.
This rotating gas, whose angular momentum axis will typically not be aligned
with the original jets, is likely to provide sufficient ram pressure at a
distance ~10 kpc from the nucleus to bend the extant jets emerging from the
central engine, thus producing a Z-symmetry in the pair of radio lobes. Once
the two black holes have coalesced some 10^7 yr later, a rapid reorientation of
the jets along a direction close to that of the orbital angular momentum of the
swallowed galaxy relative to the primary galaxy would create the younger
primary lobes of the X-shaped radio galaxy. This picture naturally explains why
such sources typically have powers close to the FR I/II break. We suggest that
purely Z-symmetric radio sources are often en route to coalescence and the
concomitant emission of substantial gravitational radiation, while X-shaped
ones have already merged and radiated.

X-ray on) states with the total period of ~300 days. A binary model is
presented to explain orbital light curves both for the high and low states as
well as the transition mechanism between them. The binary model consists of a
white dwarf (WD), a disk around the WD, and a lobe-filling main-sequence (MS)
companion. In the optical high state, the mass transfer rate to the WD exceeds
the critical rate of ~1 x 10^{-6} Msun/yr, and the WD blows an optically thick,
massive wind. Surface layers of the disk are blown in the wind and the disk
surface extends to the companion or over. As a result, optical luminosity of
the disk increases by a magnitude because of its large irradiation effect. The
massive wind completely obscures soft X-rays. This corresponds to the optical
high/soft X-ray off state. The transition between optical high and low states
is driven by an attenuation of the mass transfer from the secondary. As the
mass supply stops, the WD wind weakens and eventually stops. The disk shrinks
to a Roche lobe size and the optical magnitude drops. This phase corresponds to
the optical low/soft X-ray on state. This cycle is repeated like a limit cycle.
The WD can grow in mass at the critical rate and eventually reach the
Chandrasekhar mass limit. This process is called ``accretion wind evolution,''
which is a key evolutionary process in a recently developed evolutionary
scenario of Type Ia supernovae. This evolutionary process was first confirmed
in the LMC supersoft X-ray source RX J0513.9$-$6951. Thus, V Sge is the second
example of accretion wind evolution.

field of view with fluxes larger than ~4x10^{-14} erg s-1 cm-2 in the band.
Follow-up optical spectroscopic observations were made, and five out of six
sources are identified with AGNs/QSOs at redshifts of 0.5-1.3. We also identify
two more additional X-ray sources detected in a soft X-ray band with AGNs/QSOs.
It is found that three QSOs identified are located at z~1.3. Two rich clusters
and several groups of galaxies are also placed at the same redshift in the
surveyed field, and projected separations between the QSOs and the clusters are
3-8 Mpc at the redshift.

important tool to investigate the halo-disk discontinuity. For the first time
it is shown that the effect of a halt in the star formation between the
halo/thick disk and thin disk phases, already suggested from studies based both
on Fe/O vs. O/H and Fe/Mg vs. Mg/H, should also be seen in a C/O versus O/H
plot if C is produced mainly by low- and intermediate-mass stars (LIMS). The
idea that C originates mainly from LIMS is suggested by the flat behavior of
the [C/Fe] ratio as a function of metallicity, from [Fe/H]=-2.2 to solar, and
by the fact that very recent C/O measurements for stars in the MW halo and disk
seem to show a discontinuity around log(O/H)+12=8.4. Finally, a more gentle
increase of N abundance with metallicity (or time), relative to models adopting
the yields of van den Hoek and Groenewegen (1997), is predicted by using the
stellar yields of Meynet and Maeder (2002 - which include stellar rotation but
not hot-bottom burning) for intermediate mass stars. This fact has some
implications for the timescales of N enrichment and thus for the interpretation
of the nature of Damped Lyman Alpha Systems.

statistical properties change under time translation, i.e., are nonstationary.
For some practical purposes, a nonstationary time series can be seen as a
concatenation of stationary segments. Using a segmentation algorithm, it has
been reported that for heart beat data and Internet traffic fluctuations--the
distribution of durations of these stationary segments decays with a power law
tail. A potential technical difficulty that has not been thoroughly
investigated is that a nonstationary time series with a (scale-free) power law
distribution of stationary segments is harder to segment than other
nonstationary time series because of the wider range of possible segment sizes.
Here, we investigate the validity of a heuristic segmentation algorithm
recently proposed by Bernaola-Galvan et al. by systematically analyzing
surrogate time series with different statistical properties. We find that if a
given nonstationary time series has stationary periods whose size is
distributed as a power law, the algorithm can split the time series into a set
of stationary segments with the correct statistical properties. We also find
that the estimated power law exponent of the distribution of stationary-segment
sizes is affected by (i) the minimum segment size, and (ii) the ratio of the
standard deviation of the mean values of the segments, and the standard
deviation of the fluctuations within a segment. Furthermore, we determine that
the performance of the algorithm is generally not affected by uncorrelated
noise spikes or by weak long-range temporal correlations of the fluctuations

declarativeness and expressiveness. Tabling has proved to be a viable technique
to efficiently overcome SLD's susceptibility to infinite loops and redundant
subcomputations. Our research demonstrates that implicit or-parallelism is a
natural fit for logic programs with tabling. To substantiate this belief, we
have designed and implemented an or-parallel tabling engine -- OPTYap -- and we
used a shared-memory parallel machine to evaluate its performance. To the best
of our knowledge, OPTYap is the first implementation of a parallel tabling
engine for logic programming systems. OPTYap builds on Yap's efficient
sequential Prolog engine. Its execution model is based on the SLG-WAM for
tabling, and on the environment copying for or-parallelism.
  Preliminary results indicate that the mechanisms proposed to parallelize
search in the context of SLD resolution can indeed be effectively and naturally
generalized to parallelize tabled computations, and that the resulting systems
can achieve good performance on shared-memory parallel machines. More
importantly, it emphasizes our belief that through applying or-parallelism and
tabling to logic programs the range of applications for Logic Programming can
be increased.

with prescribed momentum charges; and topologically, the moduli space of stable

$Hom_{E,F}(T) = Hom(E_T,F_T)$ where $E_T$ and $F_T$ are the pull-backs of $E$

representable for all $E$. We prove the converse of the above, in fact, we show
that if $L$ is a relatively ample line bundle on $X$ over $S$ such that the

in proving the author's earlier result (see arXiv.org/abs/math.AG/0204047) that
the automorphism group functor of a coherent sheaf on $S$ is representable if

of a wave-chaotic system, where the lack of symmetry in the resonator shape
leads to non-integrable ray dynamics. Modes of such resonators display a rich
spatial structure, and cannot be classified through mode indices which would
require additional constants of motion in the ray dynamics. Understanding and
controlling the emission properties of such resonators requires the
investigation of the correspondence between classical phase space structures of
the ray motion inside the resonator and resonant solutions of the wave
equations. We first discuss the breakdown of the conventional eikonal
approximation in the short wavelength limit, and motivate the use of
phase-space ray tracing and phase space distributions. Next, we introduce an
efficient numerical method to calculate the quasi-bound modes of dielectric
resonators, which requires only two diagonalizations per N states, where N is
approximately equal to the number of half-wavelengths along the perimeter. The
relationship between classical phase space structures and modes is displayed

numerous physically fundamental concepts. In spite of that, the didactic
potential provided by quaternion interrelationships in formulating physical
laws are hardly regarded in the current physics curriculum. In particular, many
approaches emerge that are useful in conveying the unity of seemingly distinct
theories in a didactically convincing manner. This will be exemplified with the
help of special relativity. The diverse examples of spatial and space-time
rotations are merged into a didactic whole by introducing quaternion
transformations and comparing them to the representation using rotation
matrices common in physics books.

results, is considered, and a generic formalization applicable to realistic
experiments is developed. It is applied to Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaos.

has been considered. The picture of mode interaction is shown to resemble
Coulomb interaction of charges: higher modes with nonzero angular momentum
interact like effective charges via exchange of zero angular momentum quanta of
the fundamental mode. Thus, at large distances this interaction becomes the
dominant mechanism of mode coupling. The developed model may be used in
designing coaxial photonic crystal fibers with strong tailored mode
interaction.

this interruption of the Hamiltonian dynamics does not effect the statistical

radioactive source. It is found that when the predictions of standard (Born
rule) quantum theory are verified by using a particular experimental procedure,
the result is the same as that predicted by quantum theory qualified by rule
(4). This example is generalized, and the result is found to be the same.

splitter is analysed in a generalised time-resolved manner. Different aspects
of the phenomenon are elaborated using different representations of the
single-photon wave packets, like the decomposition into single-frequency field
modes or spatio-temporal modes matching the photonic wave packets. Both
representations lead to equivalent results, and a photon-by-photon analysis
reveals that the quantum-mechanical two-photon interference can be interpreted
as a classical one-photon interference once a first photon is detected. A novel
time-dependent quantum-beat effect is predicted if the interfering photons have
different frequencies. The calculation also reveals that full two-photon fringe
visibility can be achieved under almost any circumstances by applying a
temporal filter to the signal.

fact, also be understood using disentanglement. Whether entangled or not, using
an ensemble approach, the experiments can be explained without any non-local
communication between Alice's photon and Bob's photon. Moreover, it is
emphasized that entanglement maintains a symmetry property between the two
photons that is absent in disentanglment, the symmetry being parity due to
phase conerence.

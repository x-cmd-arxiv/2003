clusters at high redshift, particularly in combination with their X-ray
properties. In this paper we quantify the expected scaling relations between
these properties using numerical simulations with various models for heating
and cooling of the cluster gas. For a Non-radiative model, we find scaling
relations in good agreement with self-similar predictions: $Y\propto T_X^{5/2}$
and $Y \propto L_X^{5/4}$. Our main results focus on predictions from Cooling
and Preheating simulations, shown by Muanwong et al. (2002) to provide a good
match to the X-ray scaling relations at z=0. For these runs we find slopes of
approximately $Y \proptoT_X^3$ and $Y \propto L_X$, steeper and flatter than
the self-similar scalings respectively. We also study the redshift evolution of
the scaling relations and find the slopes show no evidence of evolution out to
redshifts well beyond one, while the normalizations of relations between the SZ
signal and X-ray properties do show evolution relative to that expected from
self-similarity, particularly at z<1.

the evolution of X-ray binaries formed in a burst of star formation of duration
20 Myr and star-formation rate 10 M_sun/yr. Our goal is to explain the hard
(2-10 keV) X-ray properties of populations of extragalactic X-ray binaries
recently observed by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, especially those associated
with recent or ongoing episodes of vigorous star formation. Our simulated X-ray
binary population reaches a maximum 2-10 keV luminosity of ~4e40 erg/s after
approximately 20 Myr. The X-ray luminous phase is sustained for a period of
several hundreds of Myr by succeeding populations of systems with lighter
secondary stars, i.e., it persists long after the star-formation episode has
ended. These results are insensitive to the poorly-constrained values of the
initial mass function and the average mass ratio between accreting and donor
stars. The computed peak X-ray luminosity is consistent with
observationally-derived correlations between the star-formation rate and the
observed hard X-ray luminosity. Model cumulative luminosity functions at the
earliest times have power-law indices in agreement with those derived from
observations of actively star-forming galaxies. The model cumulative luminosity
functions become increasingly steeper with time as the most luminous systems
die off, which offers an explanation for the difference in the slopes of
observed cumulative luminosity functions of young and old stellar populations.

lines as identified and fitted with VPFIT. At 0.03 s/km <k<0.1 s/km the ``3D''
power spectrum of the randomised flux agrees with that of observed spectra
within the errors. At larger scales it is still greater than 50 % of that of
the observed spectra. At smaller scales the flux power spectrum is dominated by
metal lines. Lines of increasing column density contribute to the ``3D'' flux
power spectrum at increasingly larger scales. Lines with 13< log
(N_HI/cm^{-2})<15 dominate at the peak of the ``3D'' power spectrum while
strong absorbers with log (N_HI/cm^{-2})>15 dominate at large scales, k< 0.03

use numerical simulations with too few strong absorption systems calibrated

which prove difficult to fit with existing models, and possibly a very strong,
broad O VII line, perhaps produced in a wind moving at a few x 10^3 km/s. The
accretion rate inferred from the X-rays is lower than the value inferred from

around Ly$\alpha$ by atomic hydrogen, which may be applied to analyses of
scattering media with high column neutral hydrogen densities including damped
Ly$\alpha$ absorption systems of quasars. The exact scattering cross section is
given by the Kramers-Heisenberg formula obtained from the fully quantum
mechanical second-order time dependent theory, where, in the case of hydrogen,
each matrix element is given in a closed analytical form. The asymmetric
deviation of the scattering cross section from the Lorentzian near the line
center is computed by expanding the Kramers-Heisenberg formula in terms of
$\Delta\omega /\omega_{Ly\alpha}$,where $\omega_{Ly\alpha}$ is the angular
frequency of the Ly$\alpha$ transition and $\Delta\omega$ is the deviation of
incident radiation from $\omega_{Ly\alpha}$. To the first order of
$\Delta\omega/\omega_{Ly\alpha}$, we obtain $\sigma(\omega) = \sigma_T (0.5
f_{12} \omega_{Ly\alpha}/\Delta\omega)^2 (1-1.79\Delta\omega /
\omega_{Ly\alpha})$, where $\sigma_T$ is the Thomson scattering cross section
and $f_{12}=0.4162$ is the oscillator strength for the Ly$\alpha$ transition.
With this deviation, the line center of the damped wing profile apparently
shifts blueward of the true Ly$\alpha$ line center. In the case of a
dampedLy$\alpha$ system with a H I column density $5\times 10^{21}{\rm
cm^{-2}}$, the apparent line center shift relative to the true center amounts
to $0.2{\rm \AA}$ resulting in an underestimation of redshift by $\Delta z\sim

Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, in order to illustrate a method to measure the
covering factor of the neutral scattering region around the giant component

the spectrum, we find broad wings around H$\alpha$ and a broad emission feature
around 6545${\rm \AA}$ that is blended with the [N II]$ \lambda$ 6548 line.
These two features are proposed to be formed by Raman scattering by atomic
hydrogen, where the incident radiation is proposed to be UV continuum radiation
around Ly$\beta$ in the former case and He II $\lambda$ 1025 emission line
arising from $n=6\to n=2$ transitions for the latter feature. We remove the
H$\alpha$ wings by a template Raman scattering wing profile and subtract the [N
II] $\lambda$ 6548 line using the 3 times stronger [N II] $\lambda$ 6583
feature in order to isolate the He II Raman scattered 6545 \AA line. We obtain
the flux ratio $F_{6545}/F_{6560}=0.24$ of the He II $\lambda$ 6560 emission
line and the 6545 \AA feature for V1016 Cyg. Under the assumption that the He
II emission from this object is isotropic, this ratio is converted to the ratio
$\Phi_{6545}/\Phi_{1025}=0.17$ of the number of the incident photons and that
of the scattered photons. This implies that the scattering region with H I
column density $N_{HI}\ge 10^{20}{\rm cm^{-2}}$ covers 17 per cent of the
emission region. By combining the presumed binary period $\sim 100$ yrs of this
system we infer that a significant fraction of the slow stellar wind from the
Mira component is ionized and that the scattering region around the Mira
extends a few tens of AU, which is closely associated with the mass loss
process of the Mira component.

evolutional behaviors. In particular, we find two kernels that may be the
footpoints of a loop. A single hard X-ray source appears to cover these two
kernels and to move across the magnetic neutral line. We explain this as a
result of the merging of two footpoint sources that show gradually asymmetric
emission owing to an asymmetric magnetic topology of the newly reconnected
loops. In one of the H-alpha kernels, we detect a continuum enhancement at the
visible wavelength. By checking its spatial and temporal relationship with the
hard X-ray emission, we ascribe it as being caused by electron beam
precipitation. In addition, we derive the line-of-sight velocity of the
filament plasma based on the Doppler shift of the filament-caused absorption in
the H-alpha blue wing. The filament shows rapid acceleration during the
impulsive phase. These observational features are in principal consistent with
the general scenario of the canonical two-ribbon flare model.

characterized by a narrow split or single emission component with a width of

The Ha profiles can be classified into three groups: double-peaked profiles
representing the majority, single-peaked emission-line profiles, and normal P
Cygni-type profiles. The forbidden lines exhibit in most cases double-peaked
profiles. The split forbidden line profiles have peak separations of as little
as 10 km/s. The ratio of violet to red emission peak intensities, V/R, is
predominantly smaller or equal to 1. Theoretical profiles were calculated for
the optically thin case. A latitude-dependent stellar wind with a radial
expansion and a velocity decreasing from the pole to the equator was adopted.
In addition an equatorial dust ring with various optical depths was assumed.
This model can explain split lines and line asymmetries observed in some stars.
Moreover, the V/R ratios can be understood in terms of this model. The

measure of 0.67$\pm$0.13 is significant at 99%. Multiple gaussians also provide

predicts a long-range ordered Q = 0 state below approximately 2 K. However,
muon spin resonance experiments reveal a paramagnetic structure down to tens of

Ising doublet has been recently understood, for the measured paramagnetic

states. However, these fluctuations treated within the random phase

the chiral correlation length stays shorter than spin correlation length,
whereas at lower temperatures below the crossover temperature T_\times, the
chiral correlation length exceeds the spin correlation length. The spin and the
chirality correlation-length exponents are estimated above T_\times to be
\nu_SG=0.9+-0.2 and \nu_CG=2.1+-0.3, respectively. These values are close to
the previous estimates on the basis of the domain-wall-energy calculation.
Discussion is given about the asymptotic critical behavior realized below
T_\times.

decoherence sources, the origins of noise inherent to the material start to
play a relevant role. One representative example are charged impurities in the
device material or substrate, which typically produce telegraph noise and can
hence be modelled as bistable fluctuators. In order to demonstrate the
possibility of the active suppression of the disturbance from a {\em single}
fluctuator, we theoretically implement an elementary bang-bang control
protocol. We numerically simulate the random walk of the qubit state on the
Bloch sphere with and without bang-bang compensation by means of the stochastic
Schr\""odinger equation and compare it with an analytical saddle point solution
of the corresponding Langevin equation in the long-time limit. We find that the
deviation with respect to the noiseless case is significantly reduced when
bang-bang pulses are applied, being scaled down approximately by the ratio of
the bang-bang period and the typical flipping time of the bistable fluctuation.
Our analysis gives not only the effect of bang-bang control on the variance of
these deviations, but also their entire distribution. As a result, we expect
that bang-bang control works as a high-pass filter on the spectrum of noise
sources. This indicates how the influence of $1/f$-noise ubiquitous to the
solid state world can be reduced.

1962 for antiferromagnets: for ferromagnetic Heisenberg models the lowest
energies in each subspace of fixed total spin are strictly ordered according to
the total spin, with the lowest, i.e., the ground state, belonging to the
maximal total spin subspace. Our main result is a proof of this conjecture for
the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXX and XXZ ferromagnets in one dimension. Our proof
has two main ingredients. The first is an extension of a result of Koma and
Nachtergaele which shows that monotonicity as a function of the total spin
follows from the monotonicity of the ground state energy in each total spin
subspace as a function of the length of the chain. For the second part of the
proof we use the Temperley-Lieb algebra to calculate, in a suitable basis, the
matrix elements of the Hamiltonian restricted to each subspace of the highest
weight vectors with a given total spin. We then show that the positivity
properties of these matrix elements imply the necessary monotonicity in the
volume. Our method also shows that the first excited state of the XXX
ferromagnet on any finite tree has one less than maximal total spin.

In the characteristic $p$-theory we describe the kernel and image of the
$q$-expansion map and prove the existence of filtration for Hilbert modular
forms; we define operators $U$, $V$ and $\Theta_\chi$ and study the variation
of the filtration under these operators. In particular, we prove that every
ordinary eigenform has filtration in a prescribed box of weights. Our methods
are geometric -- comparing holomorphic Hilbert modular forms with rational
functions on a moduli scheme with level-$p$ structure, whose poles are
supported on the non-ordinary locus.
  In the $p$-adic theory we study congruences between Hilbert modular forms.
This applies to the study of congruences between special values of zeta
functions of totally real fields. It also allows us to define $p$-adic Hilbert
modular forms ""\`a la Serre"" as $p$-adic uniform limit of classical modular
forms, and compare them with the $p$-adic modular forms ""\`a la Katz"" that are
regular functions on a certain formal moduli scheme. We show that the two
notions agree for cusp forms and for a suitable class of weights containing all
the classical ones. We extend the operators $V$ and $\Theta_\chi$ to the
$p$-adic setting.

Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) quantum key distribution protocol, Shor and

(CSS) code had been implicitly used in the BB84 protocol, and suggested its
security could be proven by bounding the fidelity, say F(n), of the
incorporated CSS code of length n in the form 1-F(n) <= exp[-n E+o(n)] for some
positive number E. This work presents such a number E=E(R) as a function of the
rate of a code R, and a threshold R' such that E(R)>0 whenever R < R', which is
larger than the achievable rate based on the Gilbert-Varshamov bound that is
essentially due to Shor and Preskill (2000). The codes in the present work are
robust against fluctuations of channel parameters, which fact is needed to
establish the security rigorously and was not proved for rates above the
Gilbert-Varshamov rate before in the literature. As a byproduct, the security
of a modified BB84 protocol against any joint (coherent) attacks is proved
quantitatively.

  Accepted for publication in Physical Review A","Phys. Rev. A 69, 022308 (2004)","10.1103/PhysRevA.69.022308",,"quant-ph",,"  We introduce a new family of separability criteria that are based on the
existence of extensions of a bipartite quantum state $\rho$ to a larger number
of parties satisfying certain symmetry properties. It can be easily shown that
all separable states have the required extensions, so the non-existence of such
an extension for a particular state implies that the state is entangled. One of
the main advantages of this approach is that searching for the extension can be
cast as a convex optimization problem known as a semidefinite program (SDP).
Whenever an extension does not exist, the dual optimization constructs an
explicit entanglement witness for the particular state. These separability
tests can be ordered in a hierarchical structure whose first step corresponds
to the well-known Positive Partial Transpose (Peres-Horodecki) criterion, and
each test in the hierarchy is at least as powerful as the preceding one. This
hierarchy is complete, in the sense that any entangled state is guaranteed to
fail a test at some finite point in the hierarchy, thus showing it is
entangled. The entanglement witnesses corresponding to each step of the
hierarchy have well-defined and very interesting algebraic properties that in
turn allow for a characterization of the interior of the set of positive maps.
Coupled with some recent results on the computational complexity of the
separability problem, which has been shown to be NP-hard, this hierarchy of
tests gives a complete and also computationally and theoretically appealing
characterization of mixed bipartite entangled states.

does not disturb the measurement outcomes of the other. We study measurements
which are described by continuous positive operator-valued measurements (or
POVMs) associated with coherent states on a Lie group. In general, operators
turn out to be invariant under the Lueders map if their P- and Q-symbols
coincide. For a spin corresponding to SU(2), the identity is shown to be the
only operator with this property. For a particle, a countable family of
linearly independent operators is identified which are invariant under the
Lueders map generated by the coherent states of the Heisenberg-Weyl group, H_3.
The Lueders map is also shown to implement the anti-normal ordering of creation
and annihilation operators of a particle.

The large effective area and low energy threshold of Milagro allow it to detect

previous instruments, and a fluence sensitivity at TeV energies comparable to
dedicated gamma-ray burst satellites at keV-MeV energies. Observation of
gamma-ray burst emission at TeV energies could place important constraints on
gamma-ray burst progenitor and emission models. This study details the
development of a weighted analysis technique; the implementation of this
technique to perform a real time search for TeV transients of 40 seconds to 3

tends to be distributed in a rounder morphology in the center. The X-ray
morphology in the spiral arms matches that seen in the mid-infrared or Halpha

formation. We see no strong evidence for X-ray emission trailing the location
of high mass star formation in spiral arms. However, population synthesis
models predict a high mechanical energy output rate from supernovae for a time
period that is about 10 times longer than the lifetime of massive ionizing
stars, conflicting with the narrow appearance of the arms in X-rays. The
fraction of supernova energy that goes into heating the ISM must depend on
environment and is probably higher near sites of active star formation. The
X-ray estimated emission measures suggest that the volume filling factors and
scale heights are high in the galaxy centers but low in the outer parts of
these galaxies. The differences between the X-ray properties and morphology in
the centers and outer parts of these galaxies suggest that galactic fountains
operate in outer galaxy disks but that winds are primarily driven from galaxy

legitimate in describing the fluctuation evolution in quasilinear as well as
nonlinear regimes in recent years. The probability distribution function of the
mass field in the LN model is long tailed and so plays an important role in
rare events, such as the formation of the first generation of baryonic objects.
We calculate density and velocity distributions of the IGM at very high spatial
resolutions, and simulate the distributions at resolution of 0.15 kpc from z=7
to 15 in the LCDM cosmological model. We performed a statistics of the hydrogen
clouds including column densities, clumping factors, sizes, masses, and spatial
number density etc. One of our goals is to identify which hydrogen clouds are
going to collapse. By inspecting the mass density profile and the velocity
profile of clouds, we found that the velocity outflow significantly postpones
the collapsing process in less massive clouds, in spite of their masses are
larger than the Jeans mass. Consequently, only massive (> 10^5 M_sun) clouds
can form objects at higher redshift, and less massive (10^4-10^5) collapsed
objects are formed later. For example, although the mass fraction in clouds
with sizes larger than the Jeans length is already larger than 1 at z=15, there
is only a tiny fraction of mass (10^{-8}) in the clouds which are collapsed at
that time. If all the ionizing photons, and the 10^{-2} metallicity observed at
low redshift are produced by the first 1% mass of collapsed baryonic clouds,
the majority of those first generation objects would not happen until z=10.

asteroids with a satellite, synchronized binaries, single fast rotators, double

effects of current observational techniques but partly also because some of

rotators) through the processes we have not taken into account in our

physics that may be required. We compare the entropy at 0.1 R_{200} and

gas fraction profile with recent observations and discuss the implications of
this temperature profile in light of these data. We find that the entropy
imparted to the gas from gravitational processes alone is larger than
previously thought. The entropy at R_{500} for rich clusters is consistent with

We also find that the gas fraction in the inner region of clusters, expected
from gravitational processes alone, is smaller than previously thought but
larger than the observed data. It does show a trend with the emission-weighted
temperature (<T>) as shown by data. We therefore find that the role of any

Preheating unbinds baryons from their dark matter haloes, yielding a baryonic
mass fraction that declines with decreasing halo mass. In addition, the spin
parameter of the gas is reduced with respect to the case without preheating,
while the misalignment between the angular momentum directions of the gas and
dark matter increases strongly. The angular momentum distributions of
individual haloes reveal that preheating decreases (increases) the mass
fraction with low (negative) specific angular momentum. We discuss the

amplitude, reflecting the perturbation dynamics, is a function of the
cosmological expansion rate at those epochs, probing the dark energy equation
of state redshift dependence independently on its present value. We provide a
worked example by considering tracking inverse power law and SUGRA Quintessence
scenarios, having sensibly different redshift dynamics and respecting all the

superconductivity and ferromagnetism in $UGe_2$, including many of the key
experimental results: metamagnetic transitions, quantum transition from
ferromagnetism to ferromagnetic superconductivity, the position of the highest

adding the coupling of the central spin to localised modes- the latter modelled
as a 'spin bath'. These modes contain most of the environmental entropy and

between oscillator bath and spin bath dominated decoherence, occurring as one
reduces the energy scale of the central spin, is characterised by very low
decoherence- we show how this works out in practise in magnetic insulators. We
then reconsider the standard quantum-classical crossover in the dynamics of a
tunneling system, including both spin and oscillator baths. It is found that
the general effect of the spin bath is to broaden the crossover in temperature
between the quantum and classical activated regimes. The example of tunneling
nanomagnets is used to illustrate this.

role of the four-quark condensates for the modifications of the vector mesons
$\rho$, $\omega$ and $\phi$ in nuclear matter. We find that in-medium
modifications of the $\rho$ and $\omega$ mesons are essentially dominated by
the dependence of the 4-quark condensate on the nucleon density. In particular,
the numerical value of a parameter ($\kappa_N$), which describes the strength
of the density dependence of the 4-quark condensate beyond the mean-field
approximation, governs the decrease of the $\rho$ mass as a function of the
density. For the $\omega$ meson the sign of the in-medium mass shift is changed
by variations of $\kappa_N$. To study consistently the in-medium broadening of
the light vector mesons we employ $\rho N$ and $\omega N$ scattering amplitudes
derived recently from a covariant unitary coupled channel approach adjusted to
pion- and photo-induced reactions. In contrast to the $\rho$ and $\omega$
mesons, the in-medium mass of the $\phi$ meson is directly related to the
chiral (strange) quark condensate. Measurements of the vector meson spectral
change in heavy-ion collisions with HADES can shed light on the yet unknown
density dependence of the 4-quark condensate.

given emphasizing the central role played by the non-linear gauge fixing
conditions for the construction of such automated codes. The need for such

reveals a further obstacle: superpotential stabilization of the
compactification volume typically modifies the inflaton potential and renders
it too steep for inflation. We discuss the non-generic conditions under which
this problem does not arise. We conclude that brane inflation models can only
work if restrictive assumptions about the method of volume stabilization, the
warping of the internal space, and the source of inflationary energy are
satisfied. We argue that this may not be a real problem, given the large range
of available fluxes and background geometries in string theory.

from the nucleon matrix element of the hyperon correlation function. Through
the dispersion relation, the correlation function in the operator product
expansion (OPE) is related with its integral over the physical energy region.
The dispersion integral around the hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) threshold is
identified as a measure of the interaction strength in the $YN$ channel. The
Wilson coefficients of the OPE for the hyperon correlation function are
calculated. The obtained sum rules relate $YN$ interaction strengths to the
nucleon matrix elements of the quark-gluon composite operators, which include
strange quark operators as well as up and down quark operators. It is found
that the $YN$ interaction strengths are smaller than the $NN$ interaction
strength since the nucleon matrix elements of strange quark operators are
smaller than those of up and down quark operators. Among $YN$ channels $\Lambda
N$ channel has stronger interaction than $\Sigma N$ and $\Xi N$ channels. Also
found is that the interaction strength is greater in the $\Sigma^+N$ ($\Xi^0
N$) channel than in the $\Sigma^-N$ ($\Xi^-N$) channel since the nucleon matrix
elements of up quark operators are greater than those of down quark operators.
The spin-dependent part is much smaller than the spin-independent part in the
$YN$ and $NN$ channels. The results of the sum rules are compared with those of
the phenomenological meson-exchange models.

interaction. Farms where the disease may be prevalent from animal, human,
vehicle or airborne transmission (dangerous contact, DC), are additionally
culled, aka next-to-nearest neighbor iteractions and lightning factor. The
resulting mathematical model possesses a phase transition, whereupon if the
physical disease transmission kernel exceeds a critical value, catastrophic
loss of animals ensues. The non-local disease transport probability can be as
low as .01% per day and the disease can still be in the high mortality phase.
We show that the fundamental equation for sustainable disease transport is the
criticality equation for neutron fission cascade. Finally, we calculate that
the percentage of culled animals that are actually healthy is ~ 30%.

deuteride (HD) at 10 atm, which is to be compared with the previous measurement
done at 100 atm. We confirm that the high pressure used in former experiments
caused no systematic effects at a level of 10 ppb. We also reexamined a
theoretical uncertainty related to screening effects in HD and HT molecules and
found that previously it was underestimated. The medium-pressure result
obtained for the free deuteron mu_d/mu_p=0.307 012 206 5(28) with a fractional
uncertainty of 9.1 * 10^-9 is free of systematic effects related to former

what emerges from Schr\""odinger's equation for a system of particles when we
merely insist that ``particles'' means particles. While distinctly
non-Newtonian, Bohmian mechanics is a fully deterministic theory of particles
in motion, a motion choreographed by the wave function. We find that a Bohmian
universe, though deterministic, evolves in such a manner that an {\it
appearance} of randomness emerges, precisely as described by the quantum
formalism and given, for example, by ``$\rho=|\psis|^2$.'' A crucial ingredient
in our analysis of the origin of this randomness is the notion of the effective
wave function of a subsystem, a notion of interest in its own right and of
relevance to any discussion of quantum theory. When the quantum formalism is
regarded as arising in this way, the paradoxes and perplexities so often
associated with (nonrelativistic) quantum theory simply evaporate.

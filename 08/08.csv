hr. The persistent intensity of GS 1826-24 increased by 36% between 1997-2000,
by which time the burst interval had decreased to 4.10 +/- 0.08 hr. In 2002
July the recurrence time was shorter again, at 3.56 +/- 0.03 hr. The bursts
within each epoch had remarkably identical lightcurves over the full approx.
150 s burst duration; both the initial decay timescale from the peak, and the
burst fluence, increased slightly with the rise in persistent flux. The
decrease in the burst recurrence time was proportional to Mdot^(-1.05+/-0.02)
(where Mdot is assumed to be linearly proportional to the X-ray flux), so that
the ratio alpha between the integrated persistent and burst fluxes was
inversely correlated with Mdot. The average value of alpha was 41.7 +/- 1.6.
Both the alpha value, and the long burst durations indicate that the hydrogen
is burning during the burst via the rapid-proton (rp) process. The variation in
alpha with Mdot implies that hydrogen is burning stably between bursts,
requiring solar metallicity (Z ~ 0.02) in the accreted layer. We show that
solar metallicity ignition models naturally reproduce the observed burst
energies, but do not match the observed variations in recurrence time and burst
fluence. Low metallicity models (Z ~ 0.001) reproduce the observed trends in
recurrence time and fluence, but are ruled out by the variation in alpha. We
discuss possible explanations, including extra heating between bursts, or that
the fraction of the neutron star covered by the accreted fuel increases with
Mdot.

extreme axial ratios ($1:0.8:0.4$) than those derived by Jones et al.
  More surprisingly, we find that starless cores have more extreme axial ratios

LBGs must evolve in this redshift interval: a constant integrated star
formation density at $z>3$ requires a much steeper faint-end slope, or a
brighter characteristic luminosity. This result is in agreement with our

the UV-plane velocities by only 6%. The radial velocity sample has a W-velocity
dispersion of sig_W = 59 km/s--in between the values associated with the thick
disk and the stellar halo. We also see indications for the presence of two
populations by analyzing the velocities in the UV plane. In addition, we
present CCD photometry for half of the sample, and with it recalibrate the
photographic photometry of the remaining WDs. Using the new photometry in
standard bands, and by applying the appropriate color-magnitude relations for H
and He atmospheres, we obtain new distance estimates. New distances of the WDs
that were not originally selected as halo candidates yield 13 new candidates.
On average, new distances produce velocities in the UV plane that are larger by
10%, with already fast objects gaining more. Using the new data, while applying
the same UV-velocity cut (94 km/s) as in OHDHS, we find a density of cool WDs
of 1.7e-4 pc^-3, confirming the value of OHDHS. In addition, we derive the
density as a function of the UV-velocity cutoff. The density (corrected for
losses due to higher UV cuts) starts to flatten out at 150 km/s (0.4e-4 pc^-3),
and is minimized (thus minimizing a possible non-halo contamination) at 190

evolution in the richness of the environments of radio-loud quasars from other
low-redshift studies to z >~ 0.9. The quasars associated with groups and
clusters in our sample do not necessarily reside in the centre of the galaxy
distribution which rarely displays a spherical geometry. Clustering is
preferentially associated with small or asymmetric steep-spectrum radio
sources. The quasars with the largest projected angular size are, in nearly all
cases, found in non-clustered environments. Radio-based selection (including
source size) of high-redshift groups and clusters can be a very efficient
method of detecting rich environments at these redshifts.
  We find that in optical searches for galaxy overdensities above z ~ 0.6
multiple filters must be used. If the single-filter counting statistics used by
groups at lower redshift are applied to our data, uncertainties are too large
to make accurate quantifications of cluster richness. This means that genuine
clustering of galaxies about quasars will be missed and, in ~10% of cases,
putative clusters turn out to be false detections. The statistics are further
diluted by the fact that galaxy overdensities are generally not centred on the

imaging data reach to Ks=20.5 (5sigma), corresponding to ~M*+2.7 with respect
to the passive evolution. The near-infrared luminosity traces the stellar mass
of a galaxy due to its small sensitivity to the recent star formation history.
Thus the luminosity function can be transformed to the stellar mass function of
galaxies using the $J-K$ colours with only a small correction (factor<2) for
the effects of on-going star formation. The derived stellar mass function spans
a wide range in mass from ~3 x 10^{11}Msun down to ~6 x 10^{9}Msun (set by the
magnitude limit). The form of the mass function is very similar to lower
redshift counterparts such as that from 2MASS/LCRS clusters (Balogh et al.

evolution of galaxy masses from z=1 to the present-day. Combined with colour
data that suggest star formation is completed early (z>>1) in the cluster core,
it seems that the galaxy formation processes (both star formation and mass
assembly) are strongly accerelated in dense environments and has been largely
completed by z=1. We investigate whether the epoch of mass assembly of massive

discontinuities in the surface brightness, which, unlike shocks, have lower gas
temperature on the X-ray brighter side of the discontinuity. For that reason
these features are called ``cold fronts''. It is believed that some cold fronts
are formed when a subcluster merges with another cluster and the ram pressure
of gas flowing outside the subcluster gives the contact discontinuity the
characteristic curved shape. While some edges may not arise directly from
mergers (e.g., A496, Dupke & White, 2003), this paper focuses on those which
arise as contact discontinuities between a merging subcluster and the ambient
cluster gas. We argue that the flow of gas past the merging subcluster induces
slow motions inside the cloud. These motions transport gas from the central
parts of the subcluster towards the interface. Since in a typical cluster or
group (even an isothermal one) the entropy of the gas in the central regions is
significantly lower than in the outer regions, the transport of the low entropy
gas towards the interface and the associated adiabatic expansion makes the gas
temperature immediately inside the interface lower than in any other place in
the system, thus enhancing the temperature jump across the interface and making
the ``tip'' of the contact discontinuity cool. We illustrate this picture with
the XMM-Newton gas temperature map of the A3667 cluster.

simulations of the ISM in the central 0.1--1 kpc region of galaxies. Possible
structure of the obscuring molecular tori around AGNs is also shown. The
nuclear starburst is an important factor in determining the structure of the
molecular tori and the mass accretion rate to the nucleus. It is natural that
the ISM in the central 100 pc region is a highly inhomogeneous and turbulent
structure. As a result, gas accretion to the central parsec region should be
time dependent and stochastic. The conventional picture of gas fueling and the
AGN unified model may be modified in many respects.

(SNe) have been discovered. Their kinetic energy of the explosions are larger
by more than an order of magnitude than the typical values for this type of
SNe, so that these SNe have been called `Hypernovae'. We first describe how the
basic properties of hypernovae can be derived from observations and modeling.
These hypernovae seem to come from rather massive stars, thus forming black
holes. On the other hand, there are some examples of massive SNe with only a
small kinetic energy. We suggest that stars with non-rotating black holes are
likely to collapse ""quietly"" ejecting a small amount of heavy elements (Faint
supernovae). In contrast, stars with rotating black holes are likely to give
rise to very energetic supernovae (Hypernovae). We present distinct
nucleosynthesis features of these two types of ""black-hole-forming"" supernovae.
Hypernova nucleosynthesis is characterized by larger abundance ratios
(Zn,Co,V,Ti)/Fe and smaller (Mn,Cr)/Fe. Nucleosynthesis in Faint supernovae is
characterized by a large amount of fall-back. We show that the abundance
pattern of the most Fe deficient star, HE0107-5240, and other extremely
metal-poor carbon-rich stars are in good accord with those of
black-hole-forming supernovae, but not pair-instability supernovae. This
suggests that black-hole-forming supernovae made important contributions to the
early Galactic (and cosmic) chemical evolution.

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are sufficiently free from the effects of cosmic

popular scenario of SN Ia progenitors, i.e., the single degenerate scenario for
the Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD) models. We identify the progenitor's
evolution with two channels: (1) the WD+RG (red-giant) and (2) the WD+MS (near
main-sequence He-rich star) channels. The strong wind from accreting WDs plays
a key role, which yields important age and metallicity effects on the
evolution.
  We suggest that the variation of the carbon mass fraction $X$(C) in the C+O
WD (or the variation of the initial WD mass) causes the diversity of SN Ia
brightness. This model can explain the observed dependence of SNe Ia brightness
on the galaxy types. We then predict how SN Ia brightness evolves along the
redshift (with changing metallicity and age) for elliptical and spiral
galaxies. Such evolutionary effects along the redshift can be corrected as has
been made for local SNe Ia.
  We also touch on several related issues: (1) the abundance pattern of stars
in dwarf spheroidal galaxies in relation to the metallicity effect on SNe Ia,
(2) effects of angular momentum brought into the WD in relation to the
diversities and the fate of double degenerates, and (3) possible presence of
helium in the peculiar SN Ia 2000cx in relation to the sub-Chandrasekhar mass

ii) the effect of a specific modeling for the galactic wind (linear vs
constant) is discussed. In a second step, the approximation of using continuous
sources in space is considered. This is completed by a study of time
discreteness through the time-dependent version of the propagation equation. A
new analytical solution of this equation for instantaneous point-like sources,

luminescence from doped double quantum wells under applied bias and optical
excitation, reported a very intriguing observation: under certain experimental
conditions, the exciton luminescence exhibits a ring pattern with a dark region
in between the center excitation spot and the luminescent ring that can extend
more than a millimeter from the center spot. Initial speculations on the origin
of this emission pattern included supersonic ballistic transport of excitons
due to their dipole-dipole repulsion and Bose superfluidity of excitons. In
this paper we show that the ring effect is also observed in single quantum well
structures, where only direct excitons exist. More importantly, we find that
these experimental results are quantitatively explained by a novel coupled 2D
electron-hole plasma dynamics, namely, photoinduced in-plane charge separation.
This charge separation explains extremely long luminescence times that may be
more than a microsecond for the ring -- orders of magnitude longer than the
emission lifetime of the excitons in the center spot. This method of
continuously creating excitons may result in a highly dense exciton gas which
is also well thermalized with the lattice (since the particles can cool over
the very long luminescence time after their hot optical creation), thus opening
up opportunities for a detailed study of quantum statistics. The in-plane
separation of the charges into positive and negative regions, with a sharp
interface between them is an interesting new example of nonequilibrium dynamics

""quasi-electrons"" carrying charge and spin, and ""svivons"" carrying spin and
lattice distortion. This is shown to result in the observed anomalous
spectroscopic properties of the cuprates. The AF/stripe-like inhomogeneities
result from the Bose condensation of the svivon field, and the speed of their
dynamics is determined by the width of the double-svivon neutron-resonance
peak. Pairing results from transitions between pair states of stripons and
quasi-electrons through the exchange of svivons. The obtained pairing symmetry
is of the d_{x^2-y^2} type; however, sign reversal through the charged stripes
results in features not characteristic of this symmetry. The phase diagram is
determined by a pairing and a coherence line, associated with a Mott
transition, and the pseudogap state corresponds to incoherent pairing.

This implies that $\lambda$, while little dependent on the carrier density in

renormalization-group approach (g-ology) including second-order corrections to
the coupling constants, we show that bond-charge-density-wave (BCDW) phase
exists for U \approx 2V in between charge-density-wave (CDW) and
spin-density-wave (SDW) phases. We find that the umklapp scattering of
parallel-spin electrons disfavors the BCDW state and leads to a bicritical
point where the CDW-BCDW and SDW-BCDW continuous-transition lines merge into
the CDW-SDW first-order transition line. In the second half of the paper, we
investigate the phase diagram of the extended Hubbard model with either
additional staggered site potential \Delta or bond alternation \delta. Although
the alternating site potential \Delta strongly favors the CDW state (that is, a
band insulator), the BCDW state is not destroyed completely and occupies a
finite region in the phase diagram. Our result is a natural generalization of
the work by Fabrizio, Gogolin, and Nersesyan [Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 2014
(1999)], who predicted the existence of a spontaneously dimerized insulating
state between a band insulator and a Mott insulator in the phase diagram of the
ionic Hubbard model. The bond alternation \delta destroys the SDW state and
changes it into the BCDW state (or Peierls insulating state). As a result the
phase diagram of the model with \delta contains only a single critical line
separating the Peierls insulator phase and the CDW phase. The addition of
\Delta or \delta changes the universality class of the CDW-BCDW transition from
the Gaussian transition into the Ising transition.

Post-annealing in nitrogen atmosphere produces larger low-frequency dielectric
relaxation as the annealing temperature increases, while annealing in oxygen

absorptive corrections and higher-twist contributions. We investigate these
uncertainties both by including explicit corrections to our standard global
analysis and by examining the sensitivity to changes of the x,Q^2,W^2 cuts on
the data that are fitted. In this way we expose those kinematic regions where
the conventional DGLAP description is inadequate. As a consequence we obtain a
set of NLO, and of NNLO, conservative partons where the data are fully
consistent with DGLAP evolution, but over a restricted kinematic domain. We
also examine the potential effects of such issues as the choice of input
parameterization, heavy target corrections, assumptions about the strange quark
sea and isospin violation. Hence we are able to compare the theoretical errors
with those uncertainties due to errors on the experimental measurements, which
we studied previously. We use W and Higgs boson production at the Tevatron and
the LHC as explicit examples of the uncertainties arising from parton
distributions. For many observables the theoretical error is dominant, but for
the cross section for W production at the Tevatron both the theoretical and
experimental uncertainties are small, and hence the NNLO prediction may serve
as a valuable luminosity monitor.

scaling dimension both for the Grassman coordinates and superfields. This
reassignment can be done in such a way that the non(anti)commutativity
parameter is dimensionless, and then the rest of the proof ammounts to power
counting. The renormalizability is also stable against adding standard
four-dimensional soft-breaking terms to the theory. However, with the new
scaling dimension assignments, some of these terms are not just relevant
deformations of the theory but become marginal.

Hence we find that higher-dimensional general relativity imposes an effective

theory. The correlators indeed vanish in a semiclassical bulk approximation. We
trace the origin of their vanishing to the continuum energy spectrum in the
presence of event horizons. We elaborate on the two very long time scales
involved: one associated with the black hole and the other with a thermal gas
in the vacuum background. We find that assigning a role to the thermal gas
background, as suggested in the above work, does restore the compliance with a
time-averaged unitarity bound. We also find that additional configurations are
needed to explain the expected time dependence of the Poincar\'e recurrences
and their magnitude. It is suggested that, while a semiclassical black hole
does reproduce faithfully ``coarse grained'' properties of the system,
additional dynamical features of the horizon may be necessary to resolve a
finer grained information-loss problem. In particular, an effectively formed
stretched horizon could yield the desired results.

operator has an atypically simple quantum circuit. Specifically, we describe
formulae, written in terms of matrix coefficients, characterizing operators
implementable with exactly zero, one, or two controlled-not (CNOT) gates and
all other gates being one-qubit. We give an algorithm for synthesizing
two-qubit circuits with optimal number of CNOT gates, and illustrate it on
operators appearing in quantum algorithms by Deutsch-Josza, Shor and Grover. In
another application, our explicit numerical tests allow timing a given
Hamiltonian to compute a CNOT modulo one-qubit gates, when this is possible.

(I\otimes\sigma_x) on bipartite qubit systems is analyzed. It is found that the
rate of loss of entanglement is not uniform over all states. The distillable
entanglement of maximally entangled states decreases faster than that of less
entangled states. The analysis is also generalized to noise channels of the
form n.sigma.

starless core that shows strong evidence for inward motions in molecular line
profiles. The J,H, and K band data were taken using the European Southern
Observatory New Technology Telescope. The best fit simple spherical power law
model has index p=2.6 +/- 0.2, over the 0.036--0.1 pc range in radius sampled
in extinction. This power law slope is steeper than the value of p=2 for a
singular isothermal sphere, the initial condition of the inside-out model for
protostellar collapse. Including an additional extinction component along the
line of sight further steepens the inferred profile. Fitting a Bonnor-Ebert
sphere results in a super-critical value of the dimensionless radius xi_max=25
+/- 3. The unstable configuration of material may be related to the observed
inward motions. The Bonnor-Ebert model matches the shape of the observed
profile, but significantly underestimates the amount of extinction (by a factor
of ~4). This discrepancy in normalization has also been found for the nearby
protostellar core B335 (Harvey et al. 2001). A cylindrical density model with
scale height H=0.0164+/- 0.002 pc viewed at a small inclination to the cylinder
axis provides an equally good radial profile as a power law model, and
reproduces the asymmetry of the core remarkably well. In addition, this model
provides a basis for understanding the discrepancy in the normalization of the
Bonnor-Ebert model, namely that L694-2 has prolate structure, with the full
extent (mass) of the core being missed by assuming symmetry between the
profiles in the plane of the sky and along the line-of-sight. If the core is
sufficiently magnetized then fragmentation may be avoided, and later evolution
might produce a protostar similar to B335.

supernovae results as a function of redshift, for SN Ia to be considered as
distance indicators. This review surveys all observational data searching for
an evolution and/or extinction, according to host morphology. For instance, it
has been observed that high-z SNe Ia have bluer colours than the local ones:
although this goes against extinction to explain why SN are dimmer with
redshift until z ~ 1, supporting a decelerating universe, it also demonstrates
intrinsic evolution effects. -- SNe Ia could evolve because the age and
metallicity of their progenitors evolve. The main parameter is carbon
abundance. Smaller C leads to a dimmer SN Ia and also less scatter on peak
brightness, as it is the case in elliptical galaxy today. Age of the progenitor
is an important factor: young populations lead to brighter SNe Ia, as in spiral
galaxies, and a spread in ages lead to a larger scatter, explaining the
observed lower scatter at high z. -- Selection biases also play a role, like
the Malmquist bias; high-z SNe Ia are found at larger distance from their host
center: there is more obscuration in the center, and also detection is easier
with no contamination from the center. This might be one of the reason why less
obscuration has been found for SNe Ia at high z. -- There is clearly a sample
evolution with z: currently only the less bright SNe Ia are detected at high z,
with less scatter. The brightest objects have a slowly declining light-curve,
and at high z, no slow decline has been observed. This may be interpreted as an
age effect, high-z SN having younger progenitors.

as well as published long-slit stellar kinematics are well fitted with this
self-consistent model, requiring neither the addition of a significant mass
contribution from a hidden disc structure, nor the presence of a central dark
mass. The data reveal the presence of a striking, highly contrasted, two-arm
gaseous spiral structure within a radius of ~200 pc, corresponding to a total
mass of 6.8x10^4 Msun of ionized gas. We use a deconvolved TIGER datacube to
probe its kinematics at a resolution of about 0.35 arcsec. Strong departures
from circular motions are observed, as well as high velocity dispersion values
on the inner side of the arms. We interpret the observed gas morphology and
kinematics as the signature of streaming gas flows driven by a ~540 pc diameter
bar with Ome=700+/-100 km/s/kpc. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the
predictions of a density wave model. This model predicts that the bar should
lie at about 35 degree from the line of nodes, and implies gas inflow towards
the central ~50 pc. The quadrupole pertubation due to this bar is estimated to
represent less than 2% of the underlying gravitational potential. Despite its
weakness, the inner bar of NGC 2974 may be able to drive some gas within a 10
pc radius. We suggest that the presence of such inner bars might be more common
among early-type disk galaxies than is generally thought, and that deep
high-resolution emission-line imagery may be the best way to detect such
structures.

diffuse X-ray emission exhibits significant substructures, possibly
representing various blown-out superbubbles or chimneys of hot gas heated in

study the particle energization in expanding magnetized electron-positron
plasmas with slab geometry. When the magnetized relativistic plasma with high
temperature (initial electron and positron temperature are
$k_{B}T_{e}=k_{B}T_{p}=5MeV$) is expanding into a vacuum, the electromagnetic
(EM) pulse with large amplitude is formed and the surface plasma particles are
efficiently accelerated in the forward direction owing to the energy conversion
from the EM field to the plasma particles. We find that the behavior of the
DRPA (Diamagnetic Relativistic Pulse Accelerator) depends strongly on the ratio
of the electron plasma frequency to the cyclotron frequency
$\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{e}$ and the initial plasma thickness. In the high
$\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{e}$ case, the EM pulse is rapidly damped and the plasma
diffuses uniformly without forming density peaks because the initial thermal
energy of the plasma is much larger than the field energy. On the contrary, in
the low $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{e}$ case, the field energy becomes large enough to
energize all the plasma particles, which are confined in the EM pulse and
efficiently accelerated to ultrarelativistic energies. We also find that a
thicker initial plasma increases the maximum energy of the accelerated
particles.

lasted for only 6 days, but the object remained active for the next several
months. Here we report on the detailed properties of light curves during the
outburst and the post-outburst active phase. We reveal that rapid optical
variations of ~100 s became more prominent when a thermal flare weakened and
the optical spectrum flattened in the Ic, Rc, and V-band region. In conjunction
with the flat spectrum in the radio range, this strongly indicates that the
origin of rapid variations is not thermal emission, but synchrotron emission.
Just after the outburst, we detected repeated flares at optical and X-ray
wavelengths. The optical and X-ray light curves exhibited a strong correlation,
with the X-rays, lagging by about 7 min. The X-ray lag can be understood in
terms of a hot region propagating into the inner region of the accretion flow.
The short X-ray lag, however, requires modifications of this simple scenario to
account for the short propagation time. We also detected rapid optical
variations with surprisingly high amplitude 50 days after the outburst, which
we call optical flashes. During the most prominent optical flash, the object
brightened by 1.2 mag only within 30 s. The released energy indicates that the
emission source should be at the innermost region of the accretion flow.

show is gapless, the resonance remains surprisingly strong and persists clearly
in Q scans and energy scans. Its similar asymmetric spectral form above Tc=59 K
suggests that incoherent superconducting pairing fluctuations are present in
the normal state. On cooling, the resonance and the stripe modulations grow in
well above Tc below a temperature that is comparable to the pseudogap
temperature where suppression occurs in local and low-momentum properties. The
spectral weight that accrues to the resonance is largely acquired by transfer
from suppressed low-energy fluctuations. We find the resonance to be
isotropically polarized, consistent with a triplet carrying ~2.6% of the total
spectral weight of the Cu spins in the planes.

technique with nanosecond laser pulses of wavelengths ranging from 430 to 600
nm, the large nonlinear absorption and refraction have been determined in terms
of the effective third-order, nonlinear-optical susceptibilities. These Z-scans
reveal that the nonlinear absorption alters from reverse saturable absorption
to saturable absorption at wavelength of ~ 540 nm. Similarly, alteration from
self-defocusing to self-focusing manifests itself at the same wavelength. The
optical limiting performance of Py-PhPPP in solution is superior to toluene
solution of [60]fullerene (C60) at 532 nm. Both UV-visible absorption spectra
and photoluminescence (PL) spectra show concentration dependence. The PL
spectra also depend on excitation wavelengths. These evidences suggest that the
aggregate formation should play an important role in the nonlinear-optical
properties of the new polymer. We attribute the reverse saturable absorption in
the region of blue and green wavelengths mainly to intra-chain, triplet-triplet
absorption while the absorption bleaching at longer wavelengths is due to
saturation in the absorption band induced by the aggregates.

which are generalizations of the Randall-Sundrum warped brane world to
codimension two and to a supersymmetric context. In these solutions the dilaton
varies over the extra dimensions, and this makes the electroweak hierarchy only
power-law sensitive to the proper radius of the extra dimensions (as opposed to
being exponentially sensitive as in the RS model). Warping changes the
phenomenology of these models because the Kaluza-Klein gap can be much larger
than the internal space's inverse proper radius. We provide examples both for
Romans' nonchiral supergravity and Salam-Sezgin chiral supergravity, and in
both cases the solutions break all of the supersymmetries of the models. We
interpret the solution as describing the fields sourced by a 3-brane and a
boundary 4-brane (Romans' supergravity) or by one or two 3-branes (Salam-Sezgin
supergravity), and we identify the topological constraints which are required
by this interpretation. For both types of solutions the 3-branes are flat for
all topologically-allowed values of the brane tensions. We identify the general
mechanism for and limitations of the self-tuning of the effective 4D
cosmological constant in higher-dimensional supergravity which these models
illustrate.

  2008, co-published with Springer-Verlag Gmbh 1672-1799 (Print) 1862-2844 (On

radiation fields is taken into account, the high order stimulated radiation and
stimulated absorption probabilities of light are not the same so that time
reversal symmetry would be violated, though the total Hamiltonian of
electromagnetic interaction is still unchanged under time reversal. The reason
to cause time reversal symmetry violation is that certain filial or partial
transitive processes of bounding state atoms are forbidden or can not be
achieved actually due to the law of energy conservation, the asymmetric actions
of effective transition operators before and after time reversal, as well as
the special states of atoms themselves. These restrictions would cause the
symmetry violation of time reversal of other filial or partial transition
processes which can be actualized really. The symmetry violation is also
relative to the initial state asymmetries of bounding atoms before and after
time reversal. For the electromagnetic interaction between non-bounding state
atoms and radiation field, there is no this kind of symmetry violation of time
reversal. In this way, the current formula of light stimulated radiation and
absorption parameters with time reversal symmetry should be revised. The
influence of time reversal symmetry violation on the foundational theory of
laser is also discussed and the phenomena of non-population inversion and
non-radiation transition can also be explained well. In this way, a more
reliable foundation can be established for the theories of laser and nonlinear
optics in which non-equilibrium processes are involved.

astrophysics research prompts the author to propose that the Newton's
gravitation law can be generalized to accommodate the antimatter: While the
force between matters(antimatters) is attractive, the force between matter and
antimatter is a repulsive one. A paradox of negative-mass in gravity versus a
basic symmetry (m-->-m) based on quantum mechanics is discussed in sufficient
detail so that the new postulate could be established quite naturally.
Corresponding modification of the theory of general relativity is also
suggested. If we believe in the symmetry of particle and antiparticle as well
as the antigravity between them, it might be possible to consider a new
scenario of the expansion of universe which might provide some new insight into
the interpretation of cosmological phenomena including the accelerating

circular. Although such criticisms have been challenged it is certainly true
that the reasoning in Einstein's original derivation is not at all obvious.
Einstein's original derivation could have been made clearer. This article
describes a clear way of doing so.

tool to characterize the properties of an incoherent source of non-interacting
Abelian anyons. This is analogous to the Hanbury--Brown Twiss effect for
particles with fractional statistics in two dimensions. In particular, using a
flux tube model for anyons, the effects of source shape and quantum statistics
on a two-particle correlation function are examined. Such a tool may prove
useful in the context of quantum computing and other experimental applications
where studying anyon sources are of interest.

We introduce a definition of a ""distance"" on classical and quantum phase spaces

means to measure the quality of approximate solutions to various problems. A
few simple applications are discussed.

the canonical orthonormal basis. Sometimes however Alice interleaves quantum
decoys $\{\frac{\ket{j}+i\ket{k}}{\sqrt{2}}\}$ between her messages. Such
pairwise superpositions of possible words cannot be distinguished from the
message words. Thus as malevolent Eve observes the quantum channel, she runs
the risk of damaging the superpositions (by causing a collapse). At the
receiving end honest Bob, whom we assume is warned of the quantum decoys'
distribution, checks upon their integrity with a measurement. The present work
establishes, in the case of individual attacks, the tradeoff between Eve's
information gain (her chances, if a message word was sent, of guessing which)
and the disturbance she induces (Bob's chances, if a quantum decoy was sent, to
detect tampering). Besides secure channel protocols, quantum decoys seem a
powerful primitive for constructing n-dimensional quantum cryptographic
applications. Moreover the methods employed in this article should be of strong
interest to anyone concerned with the old but fundamental problem of how much
information may be gained about a system, versus how much this will disturb the
system, in quantum mechanics. Keywords: d-level systems cryptography

correlations in a multipartite system. Entanglement is defined as the
difference in the correlation information encoded by the state of a system and
a suitably defined separable state with the same marginals. A generalization of
the Schmidt decomposition is developed to implement the separation of
correlations for any pure, multipartite state. The measure based on this
decomposition is a generalization of the entanglement of formation to
multipartite systems, provides an upper bound for the relative entropy of
entanglement, and is directly computable on pure states. The example of pure
three-qubit states is analyzed in detail, and a classification based on
minimal, four-term decompositions is developed.

technique. The method is based on a stochastic formulation of the von Neumann
equation of the composite system and employs a pair of product states following
a Markovian random jump process. The performance of the method is illustrated
by means of stochastic simulations of the dynamics of open systems interacting
with a Bosonic reservoir at zero temperature and with a spin bath in the strong
coupling regime.

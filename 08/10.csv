focusing on the delivery of volatiles (primarily water) to the terrestrial
planets. Our simulations include both planetary ""embryos"" (defined as Moon to
Mars sized protoplanets) and planetesimals, assuming that the embryos formed
via oligarchic growth. We investigate volatile delivery as a function of
Jupiter's mass, position and eccentricity, the position of the snow line, and
the density (in solids) of the solar nebula.
  In all simulations, we form 1-4 terrestrial planets inside 2 AU, which vary
in mass and volatile content. In 42 simulations we have formed 43 planets
between 0.8 and 1.5 AU, including 11 ""habitable"" planets between 0.9 and 1.1
AU. These planets range from dry worlds to ""water worlds"" with 100+ oceans of
water (1 ocean = 1.5x10^24 g), and vary in mass between 0.23 and 3.85 Earth
masses.
  There is a good deal of stochastic noise in these simulations, but the most
important parameter is the planetesimal mass we choose, which reflects the
surface density in solids past the snow line. A high density in this region
results in the formation of a smaller number of terrestrial planets with larger
masses and higher water content, as compared with planets which form in systems
with lower densities.
  We find that an eccentric Jupiter produces drier terrestrial planets with
higher eccentricities than a circular one. In cases with Jupiter at 7 AU, we
form what we call ""super embryos,"" 1-2 Earth mass protoplanets which can serve
as the accretion seeds for 2+ Earth mass planets with large water contents.

different misfits and interatomic potentials. We find that the energy barrier
decreases strongly with misfit. In contrast to continuous elastic theory, a

regime of heavy squarks and gluino, we derive analytic expressions for the
beyond--LO corrections to the Wilson coefficients and find them to be often
large, especially at large $\tan\beta$ and $\mu>0$. The ensuing ranges of
values of the Wilson coefficients are typically smaller than in the LO
approximation, and sometimes even change sign. This has the effect of often
reducing, relative to the LO, the magnitude of supersymmetric contributions to
$BR(B \to X_s \gamma)$. This ``focusing effect'' is caused by contributions
from: (i) an RG evolution of the Wilson coefficients; (ii) a correction to the
LO chargino contribution to the Wilson coefficients, which can considerably
reduce the LO gluino contribution. This partial cancellation of the two
contributions takes place only in the case of general flavor mixing. As a
result, stringent lower bounds on the mass scale of superpartners, which apply
in the case of minimal flavor violation, can be substantially reduced for even
small departures from the scenario. The often disfavored case of $\mu<0$ can
also become allowed for $M_{SUSY}$ as small as $\sim$ 200 GeV, compared to >
$\sim$ 500 GeV at LO and over 2 TeV in the case of minimal flavor violation.
Limits on the allowed amount of flavor mixing among the 2nd and 3rd generation
down--type squarks are also typically considerably weakened. The input CKM
matrix element $K^{(0)}_{cb}$ can be larger than the experimental value by a
factor of ten, or can be as small as zero.

  3-manifolds and a question of Perelman","published version","J. Amer. Math. Soc. 18 (2005), no. 3, 561-569",,,"math.AP",,"  In this note we prove some bounds for the extinction time for the Ricci flow
on certain 3-manifolds. Our interest in this comes from a question of Grisha
Perelman asked to the first author at a dinner in New York City on April 25th
of 2003. His question was ``what happens to the Ricci flow on the 3-sphere when
one starts with an arbitrary metric? In particular does the flow become extinct
in finite time?'' He then went on to say that one of the difficulties in
answering this is that he knew of no good way of constructing minimal surfaces
for such a metric in general. However, there is a natural way of constructing
such surfaces and that comes from the min--max argument where the minimal of
all maximal slices of sweep-outs is a minimal surface; see, for instance, [CD].
The idea is then to look at how the area of this min-max surface changes under
the flow. Geometrically the area measures a kind of width of the 3-manifold and
as we will see for certain 3-manifolds (those, like the 3-sphere, whose prime
decomposition contains no aspherical factors) the area becomes zero in finite
time corresponding to that the solution becomes extinct in finite time.
Moreover, we will discuss a possible lower bound for how fast the area becomes
zero. Very recently Perelman posted a paper (see [Pe1]) answering his original
question about finite extinction time. However, even after the appearance of
his paper, then we still think that our slightly different approach may be of
interest. In part because it is in some ways geometrically more natural, in
part because it also indicates that lower bounds should hold, and in part
because it avoids using the curve shortening flow that he simultaneously with
the Ricci flow needed to invoke and thus our approach is in some respects
technically easier.

transverse momentum diffusion and medium induced non-Abelian energy loss of the

demonstrates that the competition between nuclear shadowing, multiple
scattering and jet quenching leads to distinctly different
enhancement/suppression of moderate and high-$p_T$ hadron production in $d+Au$
and $Au+Au$ collisions at RHIC. The associated increase of di-jet acoplanarity,

parton-nucleon cross sections predicts naturally the competing pattern of
low-pT suppression due geometrical shadowing, and a moderate-pT Cronin
enhancement of hadron spectra. The formal equivalence to recent classical
Yang-Mills calculations is demonstrated, but our approach is shown to be more
general in the large x>0.01 domain because it automatically incorporates the
finite kinematic constraints of both quark and gluon processes in the
fragmentation regions, and accounts for the observed spectra in elementary
pp-->\pi+X processes in the RHIC energy range, sqrt{s} = 20-200 GeV. The
Glauber-Eikonal formalism can be used as a baseline to extract the magnitude of
dynamical shadowing effects from the experimental data at differente
centralities and pseudo-rapidities.

  Processing",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  The Visible Light Photon Counter (VLPC) features high quantum efficiency and
low pulse height dispersion. These properties make it ideal for efficient
photon number state detection. The ability to perform efficient photon number
state detection is important in many quantum information processing
applications, including recent proposals for performing quantum computation
with linear optical elements. In this paper we investigate the unique
capabilities of the VLPC. The efficiency of the detector and cryogenic system
is measured at 543nm wavelengths to be 85%. A picosecond pulsed laser is then
used to excite the detector with pulses having average photon numbers ranging
from 3-5. The output of the VLPC is used to discriminate photon numbers in a
pulse. The error probability for number state discrimination is an increasing
function of the number of photons, due to buildup of multiplication noise. This
puts an ultimate limit on the ability of the VLPC to do number state detection.
For many applications, it is sufficient to discriminate between 1 and more than
one detected photon. The VLPC can do this with 99% accuracy.

forest of QSO absorption spectra obtained from LUQAS which consists of spectra
observed with the high resolution Echelle spectrograph UVES. Typical errors on
the observed bispectrum as obtained from a jack-knife estimator are ~ 50%. For
wavenumbers in the range 0.03 s/km <k < 0.1 s/km the observed bispectrum agrees
within the errors with that of the synthetic absorption spectra obtained from
numerical hydro-simulations of a LCDM model with and without feedback from star
formation. Including galactic feedback changes the bispectrum by less than 10%.
At smaller wavenumbers the associated metal absorption lines contribute about
50% to the bispectrum and the observed bispectrum exceeds that of the
simulations. At wavenumbers k< 0.03 (s/km) second-order perturbation theory
applied to the flux spectrum gives a reasonable (errors smaller than 30%)
approximation to the bispectra of observed and simulated absorption spectra.
The bispectrum of the observed absorption spectra also agrees, within the
errors, with that of a randomized set of absorption spectra where a random
shift in wavelength has been added to absorption lines identified with VPFIT.
This suggests that for a sample of the size presented here, the errors on the
bispectrum are too large to discriminate between models with very different 3D
distribution of Lyman-alpha absorption. If it were possible to substantially
reduce these errors for larger samples of absorption spectra, the bispectrum
might become an important statistical tool for probing the growth of
gravitational structure in the Universe at redshift z>2.

T_c, expelling a fraction of the surface magnetic field via the Meissner
effect. We show that if a small fraction (\leq 10%) of the surface magnetic
field (10^{14} - 10^{15} {\rm G}) is expelled, it quickly decays via magnetic
reconnection and heats up the quark star surface to temperatures > 10^9 {\rm
K}. Created (e^{+},e^{-}) pairs annihilate into gamma rays emitted in a giant
burst (the first burst in our model), with a luminosity of \sim 10^{45} {\rm

surface magnetic field following the formation and relaxation of a vortex
lattice which confines the internal magnetic field. During this phase, energy
is sporadically released as a consequence of magnetic reconnection events in
the entangled surface magnetic field as it evolves into a smooth, more stable,
configuration. The star eventually enters a quiescent phase in which energy is
continuously supplied by vortex annihilation at the surface. As the star spins
down, the outermost vortex lines will be pushed to the surface where they
annihilate and release their confined magnetic field. We show that the
corresponding luminosity is L_v \sim 10^{36} {\rm ergs} {\rm s}^{-1} for a
typical soft gamma-ray repeater spinning with a period of 8 {\rm s} and a
surface magnetic field not exceeding 10^{15} {\rm G}. Our model can be applied

fraction $f$ of its gas fails to heat to the virial temperature, where $f$ is
large for haloes less massive than the value $M^*$ associated with $L^*$
galaxies. Stars and galaxies form only from the cool gas fraction. Hot gas is
ejected from low-mass systems as in conventional semi-analytic models of galaxy
formation. In high-mass systems it is retained but does not cool and form
stars. Instead it builds up as a largely inert atmosphere, in which cooling is
inhibited by an episodically active galactic nucleus. Cold gas frequently falls
into galactic haloes. In the absence of a dense atmosphere of
virial-temperature gas it builds up on nearly circular orbits and forms stars.
When there is a sufficiently dense hot atmosphere, cold infalling gas tends to
be ablated and absorbed by the hot atmosphere before it can form stars. The
picture nicely explains away the surfeit of high-luminosity galaxies that has
recently plagued semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, replacing them by
systems of moderate luminosity from old stars and large X-ray luminosities from
hot gas.

Seyfert 1 galaxies selected from the Hamburg/ESO-Survey, for which host galaxy
dependent selection biases are greatly reduced compared to other optical
surveys. Only one object in the sample is known to be radio-loud.
  We adopted a procedure to remove the AGN contribution by subtracting a scaled
point spread functions from each QSO image. To reclaim the integrated host
galaxy flux we correct for oversubtraction based on simulations. This method
shows to be quite insensitive to the host galaxy morphological type, which we
can unambiguously established for 15 of the 57 objects.
  The quasar host galaxies are detected in all cases. The hosts are very
luminous, ranging in absolute magnitude M_B from -19.0 to -23.8, with an
average of M_B,gal = -21.5, considerably above L* for field galaxies. For the
luminous QSO subsample with M_B < -23 the average host absolute magnitude is
M_B,gal = -23.0, while for the complementary low-luminosity AGN we get M_B,gal
= -21.2, roughly equal to L*.
  The luminous host galaxies in the sample are typically approx. 1 mag brighter
than expected when inferring B band luminosities from studies of similar
objects at longer wavebands. We argue that this mismatch is not likely to be
explained by selection effects, but favor host galaxy colours significanlty
bluer than those of inactive galaxies. Although published B band data are

allows the non-Abelian topology. We establish the non-Abelian flux quantization
in two-gap superconductor by demonstrating the existence of non-Abelian
magnetic vortex whose flux is quantized in the unit $4\pi/g$, not $2\pi/g$. We
also discuss a genuine non-Abelian gauge theory of superconductivity which has
a local SU(2) gauge symmetry, and establish the non-Abelian Meissner effect in
the non-Abelian superconductor. We compare the non-Abelian vortices with the
well-known Abelian Abrikosov vortex, and discuss how these non-Abelian vortices
could be observed experimentally in two-gap superconductor made of ${\rm
MgB_2}$ and spin-1/2 condensate of $^{87}{\rm Rb}$ atoms. Finally, we argue
that the existence of the non-Abelian vortices provides a strong evidence for
the existence of topological knots in these condensed matters whose topology is
fixed by $\pi_3(S^2)$, which one can construct by twisting and connecting the
periodic ends of the non-Abelian vortices.

conventional s-wave superconductivity in MgCNi3. The Hall effect and the
thermoelectric power experiments suggest that the carriers responsible for the
transport properties are electrons, in obvious contrast to holes predicated by
the band structure calculations. In this article, we report the results of C(T)
experiments, upper critical field Hc2 measurements, and the pressure effects on
MgCNi3. These experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that superconductivity
in MgCNi3 is well explained within the conventional electron-phonon interaction
scenario, at most with minor modifications from the magnetic interaction. The
thermodynamic data C(T) is consistent with the conventional s-wave order
parameter. Hc2 of all samples follows a universal WHH relation . Surprisingly,
dTc/dP is positive which leaves room for further improvements in band structure
calculations. There are other serious discrepancies between experiments and
theory like in the transport properties and x-ray photoemission. The possible
reconciliation within the two-band model and the consequent difficulties are

theory naturally captures the `flow of time' as a genuinely structural
attribute of the world. The theory also predicts expected
deviations--suppressed quadratically by the Planck energy--from the dispersion
relations for free fields in the vacuum. The deviations from the special
relativistic Doppler shifts predicted by the theory are also suppressed
quadratically by the Planck energy. Nonetheless, in order to estimate the
precision required to distinguish the theory from special relativity, an
experiment with a binary pulsar emitting TeV range gamma-rays is considered in
the context of the predicted deviations from the second-order shifts.

decrease monotonically and rapidly with radius. As the ``cut'' parameter $a$
decreases, the disks become more relativistic, with surface energy density and
pressure more concentrated near the center. Also regions of unstable circular
orbits are more likely to appear for high relativistic disks. Parameters can be
chosen so that the sound velocity in the fluid and the tangential velocity of
test particles in circular motion are less then the velocity of light. This
tangential velocity first increases with radius and reaches a maximum.

of the spiking of the individual neurons is surprisingly large which may
deteriorate the adequate functioning of the Hebbian mechanisms. In this paper
we focus on networks in which Hebbian-like adaptation is induced only by
external random noise and study spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity. We
show that such `HebbNets' are able to develop a broad range of network
structures, including scale-free small-world networks. The development of such
network structures may provide an explanation of the role of noise and its
interplay with Hebbian plasticity. We also argue that this model can be seen as
a unification of the famous Watts-Strogatz and preferential attachment models
of small-world nets.

B580 (2004) 137-143","10.1016/j.physletb.2003.11.049",,"nucl-th cond-mat hep-ph",,"  The thermodynamic properties of proton rich systems are explored in a mean
field approach which is generated from a Skyrme interaction. The addition of
Coulomb interactions result in asymmetries which modify the chemical and
mechanical instability of the system and its equilibrium properties. These
properties are studied for systems with proton fraction $y$ on the proton
richer side of the valley of $\beta$-stability as well as the neutron rich
side. Coulomb induced instabilities lead to proton diffusion processes on the
proton richer side and also large asymmetries in chemical and mechanical
instabilities and coexistence curves. Considering the whole range of $0 \le y
\le 1$, we can study how the symmetry about $y=1/2$ is broken by asymmetric
interaction and we can also explicitly show that the role between proton and
neutron is exchanged around $y_E$. It is shown that there are two asymmetric
coexistence surfaces in $(y, P, T)$ space, one for $y < y_E$ and another for $y
> y_E$ and touching each other at $y_E$. These asymmetries in instabilities
show up as new branches, one for $y < y_E$ and one for $y > y_E$, and thus form
a closed loop in pressure versus $\rho$ for both chemical instability and
coexistence regions. The branch of $y > 1/2 > y_E$ was not previously
investigated since only the $y < 1/2$ region is usually considered. In our
simplified model, mechanical instability is still symmetric around a point $y_E
\ne 1/2$ even with Coulomb forces present.

Kevrekidis","Application of Coarse Integration to Bacterial Chemotaxis","22 pages; Submitted to Journal of Chemical Physics",,,,"physics.comp-ph physics.bio-ph q-bio.CB",,"  We have developed and implemented a numerical evolution scheme for a class of
stochastic problems in which the temporal evolution occurs on widely-separated
time scales, and for which the slow evolution can be described in terms of a
small number of moments of an underlying probability distribution. We
demonstrate this method via a numerical simulation of chemotaxis in a
population of motile, independent bacteria swimming in a prescribed gradient of
a chemoattractant. The microscopic stochastic model, which is simulated using a
Monte Carlo method, uses a simplified deterministic model for
excitation/adaptation in signal transduction, coupled to a realistic,
stochastic description of the flagellar motor. We show that projective time
integration of ``coarse'' variables can be carried out on time scales long
compared to that of the microscopic dynamics. Our coarse description is based
on the spatial cell density distribution. Thus we are assuming that the system
``closes'' on this variable so that it can be described on long time scales
solely by the spatial cell density. Computationally the variables are the
components of the density distribution expressed in terms of a few basis
functions, given by the singular vectors of the spatial density distribution
obtained from a sample Monte Carlo time evolution of the system. We present
numerical results and analysis of errors in support of the efficacy of this
time-integration scheme.

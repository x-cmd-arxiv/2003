in low-mass binary systems. Two kHz QPOs are usually detected in each star.
Burst oscillations and two kHz QPOs have recently been detected in the 401 Hz
accretion-powered X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. In this star the frequency of
the burst oscillation is approximately equal to the star's spin frequency
nu_spin whereas the frequency separation of the two kHz QPOs is approximately
nu_spin/2. If as expected the frequency of the burst oscillations in other
stars is also approximately nu_spin, the frequency separation is approximately
nu_spin in some stars but approximately nu_spin/2 in others. A frequency
separation approximately equal to nu_spin/2 is unexplained in all existing
models of the kHz QPOs. Here we propose a modified version of the sonic-point
beat-frequency model that can explain within a single framework why the
frequency separation is close to nu_spin in some stars but close to nu_spin/2
in others. As in the original sonic-point model, the frequency nu_QPO2 of the
upper kHz QPO is close to the orbital frequency nu_orb at the radius r_{sp} of
the sonic point in the disk flow. We show that magnetic and radiation fields
rotating with the star will preferentially excite vertical motions in the disk
at the ""spin-resonance'' radius r_{sr} where nu_orb - nu_spin is equal to the
vertical epicyclic frequency, producing vertical motions in the disk that
modulate the X-ray flux at approximately nu_QPO2 - nu_spin or approximately
nu_QPO2 - nu_spin/2, depending on whether the disk flow at r_{sr} is smooth or
clumped. This sonic-point and spin-resonance model can also explain
quantitatively the decrease of the kHz QPO frequency separation with increasing
accretion rate that is observed in many sources.

energy (DE) of the universe are two simultaneous manifestations of an
inhomogenous dilaton. The equation of state of the field is scale-dependent and
pressureless at galactic and larger scales and it has negative pressure as a DE
at very large scales. The dilaton drives an inflationary phase followed by a
kinetic energy-dominated one, as in the ""quintessential inflation"" model
introduced by Peebles & Vilenkin, and soon after the end of inflation particle
production seeds the first inhomogeneities that lead to galaxy formation. The
dilaton is trapped near the minimum of the potential where it oscillates like a
massive field, and the excess of kinetic energy is dissipated via the mechanism
of ""gravitational cooling"" first introduced by Seidel & Suen. The
inhomogeneities therefore behave like solitonic oscillations around the minimum
of the potential, known as ""oscillatons"", that we propose account for most DM
in galaxies. Those regions where the dilaton does not transform enough kinetic
energy into reheating or carry an excess of it from regions that have cooled,
evolve to the tail of the potential as DE, driving the acceleration of the
universe.

IGM infall toward the emitting galaxy. Galactic winds may play a crucial role
in determining observed Lyman-alpha line fluxes. We compare our model
predictions with observations of two z=6.5 galaxies and conclude that, if
galactic winds are allowed for, existing observations place no constraint on
the neutral fraction of the IGM at z=6.5. Future space-based observations will
constrain the importance of galactic winds; if winds are unimportant for the
observed z=6.5 galaxies, our models suggest that the IGM neutral fraction at
z=6.5 is <~0.1.

and in the diffuse interstellar medium, as well as reacceleration, with the
injection and subsequent acceleration of suprathermal particles from the
postshock thermal pool. Selfconsistent CR spectra are calculated on the basis
of the nonlinear kinetic model. It is shown that GCR reacceleration and CR
spallation produce a measurable effect at high energies, especially in the
secondary to primary (s/p) ratio, making its energy-dependence substantially
flatter than predicted by the standard model. Quantitatively, the effect
depends strongly upon the density of the surrounding circumstellar matter. GCR
reacceleration dominates secondary CR production for a low circumstellar
density. It increases the expected s/p ratio substantially and flattens its
spectrum to an almost energy-independent form for energies larger than 100
GeV/n if the supernovae explode on average into a hot dilute medium with
hydrogen number density $N_H=0.003$cm$^{-3}$. The contribution of CR spallation
inside SNRs to the s/p ratio increases with increasing circumstellar density
and becomes dominant for $N_H\gsim 1$ cm$^{-3}$, leading at high energies to a
flat s/p ratio which is only by a factor of three lower than in the case of the

synchrotron cooling in equip., (II) moderate synchrotron cooling in equip.,
(III) weak synchrotron plus SSC cooling, and (IV) moderate synchrotron plus SSC
cooling. We argue that case (II) can most reasonably explain the overall
emission from knot C. Case (III) is also possible, but requires a large
departure from equipartition and for the jet power to be comparable to that of
the brightest quasars. Diffuse X-ray emission has also been detected,
distributed widely over the full extent (63kpc x 25kpc) of the radio lobes. We
compare the total energy contained in the lobes with the jet power estimated
from knot C, and discuss the energetic link between the jet and the lobes. We
argue that the fueling time (t_fuel) and the source age (t_src) are comparable
for case (II), whereas t_fuel << t_src is likely for case (III). The latter may
imply that the jet has a very small filling factor, ~10^{-3}. We consider the
pressure balance between the thermal galaxy halo and non-thermal relativistic
electrons in the radio lobes. Finally, we show that the X-ray emission from the
nucleus is not adequately fitted by a simple absorbed power-law model, but
needs an additional power-law with heavy absorption intrinsic to the source.
Such a high column density is consistent with the presence of a dense, dusty
torus which obscures the quasar nucleus.

trailing spiral shocks with the pitch angle of larger than ~10 deg wiggle, and
clumps are developed in the shock-compressed layer. The numerical simulations
also show clear wave crests that are associated with ripples of the spiral

spite of this local instability, the global spiral morphology of the gas is
maintained over many rotational periods. The Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability
in a shear layer behind the shock is a possible mechanism for the wiggle
instability. The Richardson criterion for the K-H stability is expressed as a
function of the Mach number, the pitch angle, and strength of the background

angles and smaller Mach numbers would be more stable, and this is consistent

We take into account grain formation in stellar mass-loss gas, grain growth by

SNe shocks. Especially, we propose that the accretion efficiency is independent
of the star-formation history. This predicts various evolutionary tracks in the
metallicity ($Z$)--dust-to-gas ratio ($\cal D$) plane depending on the
star-formation history. In this framework, the observed linear $Z$--$\cal D$
relation of nearby spiral galaxies can be interpreted as a sequence of a
constant galactic age. We emphasize that an observational study of the
$Z$--$\cal D$ relation of galaxies at $z\sim 1$ is very useful to constrain the
efficiencies of dust growth and destruction. We also suggest that the
  Lyman break galaxies at $z\sim 3$ have a very low dust-to-metal ratio,

tracks in the $Z$--$\cal D$ plane is quite small, the dispersion of the infall

undisturbed old stellar disks, truncated gas disks that are much smaller than

the lattice deformation takes place. The calculated local density of states
suggests the electronic structure is strongly modulated as a response to the

  version","Phys.Rev. D68 (2003) 104030","10.1103/PhysRevD.68.104030",,"gr-qc hep-th",,"  A detailed description of how black holes grow in full, non-linear general
relativity is presented. The starting point is the notion of dynamical
horizons. Expressions of fluxes of energy and angular momentum carried by
gravitational waves across these horizons are obtained. Fluxes are local and
the energy flux is positive. Change in the horizon area is related to these
fluxes. A notion of angular momentum and energy is associated with
cross-sections of the horizon and balance equations, analogous to those
obtained by Bondi and Sachs at null infinity, are derived. These in turn lead
to generalizations of the first and second laws of black hole mechanics. The
relation between dynamical horizons and their asymptotic states --the isolated
horizons-- is discussed briefly. The framework has potential applications to
numerical, mathematical, astrophysical and quantum general relativity.

relativistic gravitomagnetic component of the gravitational field of the Earth.
One proposal consists of the measurement of the difference of the rates of the
perigee $\psi$ from the analysis of the laser--ranged data of two identical
Earth'artificial satellites placed in equal orbits with supplementary
inclinations. In this way the impact of the aliasing classical secular
precessions due to the even zonal harmonics of the geopotential would be
canceled out, although the non--gravitational perturbations, to which the
perigees of LAGEOS--type satellites are particularly sensitive, should be a
limiting factor in the obtainable accuracy. With a suitable choice of the
inclinations of the orbital planes it would be possible to reduce the periods
of such insidious perturbations so to use not too long observational time
spans. However, the use of a pair of drag--free satellites would greatly reduce
this problem, provided that the time span of the data analysis does not excess
the lifetime of the drag--free apparatus. In the other proposal the difference
of the rotational periods of two counter-revolving particles placed on a
friction-free plane in a vacuum chamber at the South Pole should be measured in
order to extract the relativistic gravitomagnetic signal. Among other very
challenging practical implications, the Earth's angular velocity
$\omega_{\oplus}$ should be known at a $10^{-15}$ rad s$^{-1}$ level from VLBI
and the friction force of the plane should be less than $2\times 10^{-9}$ dyne.

  Measurement of Particle Lifetime","LATEX, 9 pages, no figures and tables",,,,"hep-ph",,"  An approach for examination of gravitational theories using precision
measurements of particle lifetime is proposed. The expressions describing
dependence of particle lifetime on gravitational potential in Einstein's and
Newton's gravity theories are obtained. In the case of Newton's gravity there
is a dependence of the particle velocity direction from the direction of matter
location, which creates the gravitational potential. If the external
gravitational field is spherical symmetric then there would be no possibility
to distinguish these types of gravity. It is found that the deposit of
gravitational potential of the Universe (in the case of uniformly distribution
of matter in the Universe) in particle lifetime is approximately one percent.
On the basis of the available experimental data it is found that deposit of
asymmetric gravitational field is $\frac{\phi}{c^2} \simeq 2 \cdot 10^{-4}$,
i.e., if the experimental precision of particle lifetime measurements will be
several units of $10^{-4}$, then we could see this effect.
  In reality, the lifetime of elementary particles can be defined by effective
masses of these particles in the external gravitational field. The expressions
for effective masses of particles in the external gravitational field for two
gravity type theories are obtained. These masses can be used at computation of
the decay probability (or lifetime) of particles by standard methods. It is
shown that in this case it is also possible to distinguish these two types of
gravity theories.

resulted in various energy-momentum complexes whose physical meaning have been
questioned. The problems associated with energy-momentum complexes resulted in
some researchers even abandoning the concept of energy-momentum localization in
favour of the alternative concept of quasi-localization. However, quasi-local
masses have their inadequacies, while the remarkable work of Virbhadra and some
others, and recent results of Cooperstock and Chang {\it et al.} have revived
an interest in various energy-momentum complexes. Hence in this work we use

Contrary to the standard four-dimensional results, the GWs at the high-energy
regime in brane-world model suffer from the effects of the non-standard
cosmological expansion and the excitation of the Kaluza-Klein modes(KK-modes),
which can affect the amplitude of stochastic gravitational wave background
significantly. To investigate these two high-energy effects quantitatively, we
numerically solve the wave equation of the GWs in the radiation dominated epoch
at relatively low-energy scales. We show that the resultant GWs is suppressed
by the excitation of the KK modes. The created KK modes are rather soft and
escape away from the brane to the bulk gravitational field. The results are
also compared to the semi-analytic prediction from the low-energy approximation
and the evolved amplitude of GWs on the brane reasonably matches the numerical
simulations.

coupled ${\cal N}=4$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in vacuum and matter,
using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In this work, we provide a physical picture
supporting and explaining most of these results within the gauge theory. The
modified Coulomb's law at strong coupling forces static charges to communicate
via the high frequency modes of the gauge/scalar fields. Therefore, the
interaction between even relativistically moving charges can be approximated by
a potential. At strong coupling, WKB arguments yield a series of deeply bound
states, whereby the large Coulomb attraction is balanced by centrifugation. The
result is a constant density of light bound states at {\bf any} value of the
strong coupling, explaining why the thermodynamics and kinetics are coupling
constant independent. In essence, at strong coupling the matter is not made of
the original quasiparticles but of much lighter (binary) composites. A
transition from weak to strong coupling is reminiscent to a transition from
high to low $T$ in QCD. We establish novel results for screening in vacuum and
matter through a dominant set of diagrams some of which are in qualitative
agreement with known strong coupling results.

these boundary RG flows in detail for all excitations. Exact Thermodynamic
Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations are derived using the lattice approach by
considering the continuum scaling limit of the $A_4$ lattice model with
integrable boundary conditions. Fixing the bulk weights to their critical
values, the integrable boundary weights admit a thermodynamic boundary field
$\xi$ which induces the flow and, in the continuum scaling limit, plays the
role of the perturbing boundary field $\phi_{1,3}$. The excitations are
completely classified, in terms of string content, by $(m,n)$ systems and
quantum numbers but the string content changes by either two or three
well-defined mechanisms along the flow. We identify these mechanisms and obtain
the induced maps between the relevant finitized Virasoro characters. We also
solve the TBA equations numerically to determine the boundary flows for the
leading excitations.

probabilistic machines is discussed. It is postulated that such computers are
implemented in biological systems as ensembles of protein molecules. The
formalism is based on an abstract computational model referred to as Protein
Molecule Machine (PMM). A PMM is a continuous-time first-order Markov system
with real input and output vectors, a finite set of discrete states, and the
input-dependent conditional probability densities of state transitions. The
output of a PMM is a function of its input and state. The components of input
vector, called generalized potentials, can be interpreted as membrane
potential, and concentrations of neurotransmitters. The components of output
vector, called generalized currents, can represent ion currents, and the flows
of second messengers. An Ensemble of PMMs (EPMM) is a set of independent
identical PMMs with the same input vector, and the output vector equal to the
sum of output vectors of individual PMMs. The paper suggests that biological
neurons have much more sophisticated computational resources than the presently
popular models of artificial neurons.

consequences (say, integrability conditions) of a primary ``superpotential''
field subject to some nonlinear and over-determined constraints (related, in
particular, to twistor structures). As the result, we obtain (in explicit or
implicit algebraic form) a distinguished class of Maxwell fields, with singular
sources necessarily carrying a ``self-quantized'' electric charge integer
multiple to a minimal ``elementary'' one. Particle-like singular objects are
subject to the dynamics consistent with homogeneous Maxwell equations and
undergo transmutations -- bifurcations of different types. The presented scheme
originates from the ``algebrodynamical'' approach developed by the author and
reviewed in the last section. Incidentally, fundamental equivalence relations
between the solutions of Maxwell equations, complex self-dual conditions and of
Weyl ``neutrino'' equations are established, and the problem of magnetic
monopole is briefly discussed.

operators entering the Bell operator (cf. S. L. Braunstein, A. Mann and M.

in continuous variable systems (and in general whenever the dimensionality of
the subsystems is greater than 2) additional parameters are present for
optimizing BIQV. Thus the expectation value of the Bell operator depends, in
addition to the orientation parameters, on configuration parameters.
Optimization of these configurational parameters leads to a unique maximal BIQV
that depends only on $\zeta.$ The configurational parameter variation is used
to show that BIQV relation to entanglement is, even for pure state, not
monotonic.

can be interpreted in the context of theoretical models based on strong, small
scale multipole fields on the neutron star surface. For multipole fields that
are relatively strong as compared to the large scale dipole field, the emitted
X-rays are thermal and likely result from polar cap heating associated with the
return current from the polar gap. On the other hand, for weak multipole
fields, the emission is nonthermal and results from synchrotron radiation of
$e^{\pm}$ pairs created by curvature radiation. The X-ray luminosity, $L_x$, is
related to the spin down power, $L_{sd}$, expressed in the form $L_x \propto
L^{\beta}_{sd}$ with $\beta \sim 0.5$ and $\sim 1$ for strong and weak
multipole fields respectively. If the polar cap size is of the order of the
length scale of the multipole field, $s$ and $\beta \sim 0.5$, the polar cap
temperature is $\sim 3 \times 10^6 K (\frac{L_{sd}}{10^{34}erg s^{-1}})^{1/8}
(\frac{s}{3\times 10^4 cm})^{-1/2}$.
  A comparison of the X-ray properties of millisecond pulsars in globular

strong small scale multipole fields from the neutron star interior may be
correlated with the age and evolutionary history of the underlying neutron
star.

nature and evolutionary history. Here we present the first long-slit, high
spectral resolution observations of this object in the lines of H$\alpha$ and
He II 4686. The position-velocity data are shown to be compatible with the
interpretation of PN G135.9+55.9 being a halo planetary nebula. In both
emission lines, we find the same two velocity components that characterize the
kinematics as that of an expanding elliptical envelope. The kinematics is
consistent with a prolate ellipsoidal model with axis ratio about 2:1, a
radially decreasing emissivity distribution, a velocity distribution that is
radial, and an expansion velocity of 30 km/s for the bulk of the material. To
fit the observed line profiles, this model requires an asymmetric matter
distribution, with the blue-shifted emission considerably stronger than the
red-shifted emission. We find that the widths of the two velocity components
are substantially wider than those expected due to thermal motions, but
kinematic structure in the projected area covered by the slit appears to be
sufficient to explain the line widths. The present data also rule out the
possible presence of an accretion disk in the system that could have been
responsible for a fraction of the H$\alpha$ flux, further supporting the
planetary nebula nature of PN G135.9+55.9.

  The production of ""super star clusters"" (SSCs; luminous, compact star
clusters) seems to be a hallmark of intense star formation, particularly in
interacting and starburst galaxies. Their sizes, luminosities, and mass
estimates are entirely consistent with what is expected for young Milky
Way-type globular clusters (GCs). SSCs are important because of what they can
tell us about GC formation and evolution (e.g., initial characteristics and
early survival rates). They are also of prime importance as probes of the
formation and (chemical) evolution of their host galaxies, and of the initial
mass function in the extreme environments required for cluster formation.
Recent evidence lends support to the scenario that Milky Way-type GCs (although
more metal rich), which were once thought to be the oldest building blocks of
galaxies, are still forming today.

quenched QCD, when the sea and valence light quark masses are not equal, the
lack of unitarity leads to the same inconsistencies as in quenched QCD and the
matrix elements cannot be determined. It is possible, however, to overcome this
problem by requiring the masses of the valence and sea quarks to be equal for
the u and d quarks while keeping the strange quark (s) quenched (or partially
quenched), but only in the kinematic region where the two-pion energy is below
the two-kaon threshold. Although our results are obtained at NLO in chiral
perturbation theory, they are more general and are also valid for non-leptonic
kaon decays (we also study the matrix elements of (8,1) operators, such as the
QCD penguin operator Q6). We point out that even in full QCD, where any
problems caused by the lack of unitarity are clearly absent, there are
practical difficulties in general, caused by the fact that finite-volume energy
eigenstates are linear combination of two-pion, two-kaon and two-eta states.
Our work implies that extracting Delta I=1/2, K-->pipi decay amplitudes from

The impact of cosmology (BBN, CMB, leptogenesis) and astrophysics (supernovae,
highest energy cosmic rays) on neutrino observables and vice versa, is
evaluated. The predictions of grand unified, radiative and other models of
neutrino mass are discussed. Ways of determining the unknown parameters of
three-neutrino oscillations are assessed, taking into account eight-fold
degeneracies in parameters that yield the same oscillation probabilities, as
well as ways to determine the absolute neutrino mass scale (from beta-decay,
neutrinoless double-beta decay, large scale structure and Z-bursts). Critical
unknowns at present are the amplitude of \nu_\mu to \nu_e oscillations and the
hierarchy of the neutrino mass spectrum; the detection of CP violation in the
neutrino sector depends on these and on an unknown phase. The estimated
neutrino parameter sensitivities at future facilities (reactors, superbeams,

Maxwell equations using the NC geometry framework. To accomplish this task, we
consider two kinds of noncommutativity formulations going along the same lines
as Feynman's approach. This allows us to go beyond the standard case and
discover non-trivial results. In fact, while the first formulation gives rise
to the static Maxwell equations, the second formulation is based on the
following assumption $m[x_{j},\dot{x_{k}}]=i\hbar \delta_{jk}+im\theta_{jk}f.$
The results extracted from the second formulation are more significant since
they are associated to a non trivial $\theta $-extension of the Bianchi-set of
Maxwell equations. We find $div_{\theta}B=\eta_{\theta}$ and $\frac{\partial
B_{s}}{\partial t}+\epsilon_{kjs}\frac{\partial E_{j}}{\partial
x_{k}}=A_{1}\frac{d^{2}f}{dt^{2}}+A_{2}\frac{df}{dt}+A_{3},$ where
$\eta_{\theta}$, $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$ and $A_{3}$ are local functions depending on
the NC $\theta $-parameter. The novelty of this proof in the NC space is
revealed notably at the level of the corrections brought to the previous
Maxwell equations. These corrections correspond essentially to the possibility
of existence of magnetic charges sources that we can associate to the magnetic
monopole since $div_{\theta}B=\eta_{\theta}$ is not vanishing in general.

asymptotic invariants associated to base loci of line bundles on smooth
projective varieties. We distinguish an open dense subset of the real big cone,
called the stable locus, consisting of the set of classes on which the
asymptotic base locus is locally constant. The asymptotic invariants define
continuous functions on the big cone, whose vanishing characterizes, roughly
speaking, the unstable locus. We show that for toric varieties at least, there
exists a polyhedral decomposition of the big cone on which these functions are
polynomial.

determined by the underlying interpolating polynomial that is used to generate

important feature of the basis is that matrix elements of a Hamiltonian are

approach the accuracy of pseudospectral methods in a regular manner, similar to

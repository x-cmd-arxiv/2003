dwarfs (WDs) of arbitrary degeneracy and evolved (He, C, O) composition. We do
so with both a simple analytical model and models calculated by integration of
hydrostatic balance using a modern equation of state valid for fully ionized
plasmas. The M-R plane is divided into three regions where either Coulomb
physics, degenerate electrons or a classical gas dominate the WD structure. For
a given M and central temperature, T_c, the M-R relation has two branches
differentiated by the model's entropy content. We present the M-R relations for
a sequence of constant entropy WDs of arbitrary degeneracy parameterized by M
and T_c for pure He, C, and O. We discuss the applications of these models to
the recently discovered accreting millisecond pulsars. We show the relationship
between the orbital inclination for these binaries and the donor's composition
and T_c. In particular we find from orbital inclination constraints that the
probability XTE J1807-294 can accommodate a He donor is approximately 15% while
for XTE J0929-304, it is approximately 35%. We argue that if the donors in
ultracompact systems evolve adiabatically, there should be 60-160 more systems
at orbital periods of 40 min than at orbital periods of 10 min, depending on
the donor's composition.

understanding of the formation of planetary systems. In the interstellar clouds
from which star form, angular momentum is regulated by magnetic fields,
preventing the spin up of contracting cores. When ~0.03 pc-sized dense cores
decouple from the magnetic field and collapse dynamically, ~10^-3 km/s*pc of
specific angular momentum is locked into the system. A viscous accretion disk
is one of two possible mechanisms available for the necessary redistribution of
angular momentum; the other one is the formation of a multiple stellar system.
Recent observational results involving high-angular resolution observations are
reviewed: the presence of disks deep inside collapsing envelopes; an accretion
shock surrounding a disk; the velocity field in collapsing and slowly rotating
envelopes; a possible transitional object, characterized as a large,
contracting disk; and the velocity field in disks around T Tauri stars.
Observational facilities becoming available over the next several years promise
to offer significant progress in the study of the origin of protoplanetary
disks.

galaxies, has discovered a population of sub-luminous and extremely compact
members, called ``ultra-compact dwarf'' (UCD) galaxies. In order to clarify the
origin of these objects, we have used self-consistent numerical simulations to
study the dynamical evolution a nucleated dwarf galaxy would undergo if
orbiting the center of the Fornax cluster and suffering from its strong tidal
gravitational field. We find that the outer stellar components of a nucleated
dwarf are removed by the strong tidal field of the cluster, whereas the nucleus
manages to survive as a result of its initially compact nature. The developed
naked nucleus is found to have physical properties (e.g., size and mass)
similar to those observed for UCDs. We also find that although this formation
process does not have a strong dependence on the initial total luminosity of
the nucleated dwarf, it does depend on the radial density profile of the dark
halo in the sense that UCDs are less likely to be formed from dwarfs embedded
in dark matter halos with central `cuspy' density profiles. Our simulations
also suggest that very massive and compact stellar systems can be rapidly and
efficiently formed in the central regions of dwarfs through the merging of
smaller star clusters. We provide some theoretical predictions on the total
number and radial number density profile of UCDs in a cluster and their
dependences on cluster masses.

Yet, they have a
series of common features. The typical energy of their $\gamma$ rays is a
fraction of an MeV. The energy distributions are well described by a ``Band
spectrum'', with ``peak energies'' spanning a surprisingly narrow range. The
time structure of a GRB consists of pulses, superimposed or not, rising and
decreasing fast. The number of photons in a pulse, the pulses' widths and their
total energy vary within broad but given ranges. Within a pulse, the energy
spectrum softens with increasing time. The duration of a pulse decreases at
higher energies and its peak intensity shifts to earlier time. Many other
correlations between pairs of GRB observables have been identified. Last (and
based on one measured event!) the $\gamma$-ray polarization is very large. A
satisfactory theory of GRBs should naturally and very simply explain, among
others, all these facts. We show that the ""cannonball"" (CB) model does it. In
the CB model the process leading to the ejection of highly relativistic jetted
CBs in core-collapse supernova (SN) explosions is akin to the one observed in
quasars and microquasars. The prompt $\gamma$-ray emission --the GRB-- is
explained extremely well by inverse Compton scattering of light in the near
environment of the SN by the electrons in the CBs' plasma. We have previously
shown that the CB-model's description of GRB afterglows as synchrotron
radiation from ambient electrons --swept in and accelerated within the CBs-- is
also simple, universal and very successful. The only obstacle still separating
the CB model from a complete theory of GRBs is the theoretical understanding of
the CBs' ejection mechanism in SN explosions.

mechanical behavior of cells, yet the basic properties of cross-linked F-actin
networks remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we have performed
numerical studies of the linear response of homogeneous and isotropic
two-dimensional networks subject to an applied strain at zero temperature. The
elastic moduli are found to vanish for network densities at a rigidity
percolation threshold. For higher densities, two regimes are observed: one in
which the deformation is predominantly affine and the filaments stretch and
compress; and a second in which bending modes dominate. We identify a
dimensionless scalar quantity, being a combination of the material length
scales, that specifies to which regime a given network belongs. A scaling
argument is presented that approximately agrees with this crossover variable.
By a direct geometric measure, we also confirm that the degree of affinity
under strain correlates with the distinct elastic regimes. We discuss the
implications of our findings and suggest possible directions for future
investigations.

dependence of the zero-field relaxation time $\tau$ above a spin-freezing
temperature $T_{g}$ (= 3.92 $\pm$ 0.11 K) is well described by critical slowing
down. The absorption $\chi^{\prime\prime}$ below $T_{g}$ decreases with
increasing angular frequency $\omega$, which is in contrast to the case of 3D
Ising spin glass. The dynamic freezing temperature $T_{f}(H,\omega)$ at which
d$M_{FC}(T,H)/$d$H=\chi^{\prime}(T,H=0,\omega)$, is determined as a function of
frequency (0.01 Hz $\leq \omega/2\pi \leq$ 1 kHz) and magnetic field (0 $\leq H
\leq$ 5 kOe). The dynamic scaling analysis of the relaxation time $\tau(T,H)$
defined as $\tau = 1/\omega$ at $T = T_{f}(H,\omega)$ suggests the absence of
SG phase in the presence of $H$ (at least above 100 Oe). Dynamic scaling

carefully using Ewald summation techniques. This degeneracy is, however,
ultimately lifted at low temperature. The long-range ordered state is
identified via mean field theory and Monte Carlo simulation techniques.
Finally, we investigate the behavior of the dipolar spin ice model in an

fermion systems for which the scattering length is much larger than the

one line of text. Looking for a method to study these coupling and mass
parameters, we put forward the idea of the Multiple Point Principle as a first
step. This principle states that Nature adjusts the coupling and mass
parameters so as to make many different vacuum states exist and have
approximately the same energy densities (cosmological constants). As an
illustrative application, we put up the proposal that a small increase (maybe
only an infinitesimal one) in the value of the top quark coupling constant
could lead to a new vacuum phase; in this new phase the binding of a bound
state of 6 top quarks and 6 anti-top quarks becomes so strong as to become a
tachyon and condense in the vacuum. Assuming the existence of a third
degenerate vacuum at the fundamental energy scale, we present a solution to the
hierarchy problem of why the ratio of the fundamental scale to the electroweak

of the quark-lepton masses and mixing angles in the Family Replicated Gauge

elementary introduction to M-theory compactifications, which are obtained from
an analysis of its low-energy effective theory, eleven-dimensional
supergravity. In particular, we show how the requirement of N=1 supersymmetry
in four dimensions leads to compactifications on G_2-manifolds. We also examine
the Freund-Rubin solution as well as the M2- and M5-brane. Secondly, we review
the construction of realistic theories in four dimensions from
compactifications on G_2-manifolds. It turns out that this can only be achieved
if the manifolds are allowed to carry singularities of various kinds. Thirdly,
we are interested in the concept of anomalies in the framework of M-theory. We
present some basic material on anomalies and examine three cases where
anomalies play a prominent role in M-theory. We review M-theory on R^10 x
S^1/Z_2 where anomalies are a major ingredient leading to the duality between
M-theory and the E_8 x E_8 heterotic string. A detailed calculation of the
tangent and normal bundle anomaly in the case of the M5-brane is also included.
It is known that in this case the normal bundle anomaly can only be cancelled
if the topological term of eleven-dimensional supergravity is modified in a
suitable way. Finally, we present a new mechanism to cancel anomalies which are
present if M-theory is compactified on G_2-manifolds carrying singularities of
codimension seven. In order to establish local anomaly cancellation we once
again have to modify the topological term of eleven-dimensional supergravity as
well as the Green-Schwarz term.

theory with an arbitrary gauge group G and add some N=2, N=1 and N=0
deformation terms. We analyze some possible vacuum solutions and phases of the
theory, depending on the deformation terms which are added. In the Coulomb
phase for the N=2* theory, G is broken to U(1)^r and the theory has monopole
solutions. Then, by adding some deformation terms, the theory passes to the
Higgs or color superconducting phase, in which G is broken to its center C_G.
In this phase we construct the Z_N flux tubes ansatz and obtain the BPS string
tension. We show that the monopole magnetic fluxes are linear integer
combinations of the string fluxes and therefore the monopoles can become
confined. Then, we obtain a bound for the threshold length of the
string-breaking. We also show the possible formation of a confining system with
3 different monopoles for the SU(3) gauge group. Finally we show that the BPS
string tensions of the theory satisfy the Casimir scaling law.

occuring at time step equal to half the period of the fastest vibrating mode.
This has became a critical barrier preventing the long time simulation of
biomolecular dynamics. Attemps to tame this instability by altering the slowly
changing force and efforts to damp out this instability by Langevin dynamics do
not address the fundamental cause of this instability. In this work, we trace
the instability to the non-analytic character of the underlying spectrum and
show that a correct splitting of the Hamiltonian, which render the spectrum
analytic, restores stability. The resulting Hamiltonian dictates that in
additional to updating the momentum due to the slowly changing force, one must
also update the position with a modified mass. Thus multiple-timestepping must
be done dynamically.

Rb in a 50 G magnetic field. At this field strength the electronic angular
momentum J and nuclear angular momentum I are only partially decoupled. As a
result of the mixing of wavefunctions of different hyperfine states, we observe
a nonlinear Zeeman effect for each sublevel, a substantial modification of the
transition probabilities between different magnetic sublevels, and the
appearance of transitions that are strictly forbidden in the absence of the
magnetic field. For the case of right- and left- handed circularly polarized
laser excitation, the fluorescence spectra differs qualitatively. Well
pronounced magnetic field induced circular dichroism is observed. These
observations are explained with a standard approach that describes the partial

density-matrix of a single-determinantal reference-state. The v-representable
problem does not appear in the proposed method, nor the need to introduce
functionals defined by a constrained search. The correlation-energy functionals
are not universal; they depend on the external potential. Nevertheless, model
systems can still be used to derive universal energy-functionals. In addition,
the correlation-energy functionals can be partitioned into individual terms
that are -- to a varying degree -- universal; yielding, for example, an
electron gas approximation. Variational and non-variational energy functionals
are introduced that yield the target-state energy when the reference state --
or its corresponding one-particle density matrix -- is constructed from
Brueckner orbitals. Using many-body perturbation theory, diagrammatic
expansions are given for the non-variational energy-functionals, where the
individual diagrams explicitly depend on the one-particle density-matrix.
Non-variational energy-functionals yield generalized Hartree--Fock equations
involving a non-local correlation-potential and the Hartree--Fock exchange;
these equations are obtained by imposing the Brillouin--Brueckner condition.
The same equations -- for the most part -- are obtained from variational
energy-functionals using functional minimizations, yielding the (kernel of)
correlation potential as the functional derivative of correlation-energy
functionals. Approximations for the correlation-energy functions are
introduced, including a one-particle-density-matrix variant of the
local-density approximation (LDA) and a variant of the Lee--Yang--Parr (LYP)
functional.

activity of a terrestrial planet is an important precondition for the emergence
of complex metazoan life forms. Technological civilizations arising on such
planets will be, at some point of their histories or another, tempted to embark
upon massive geo-engineering projects. If, for some reasons only very recently
understood, large-scale geo-engineering is in fact much more dangerous than
previously thought, the scenario in which at least some of the extraterrestrial
civilizations in the Milky Way self-destruct in this manner gains plausibility.
In addition, we speculate on possible reasons, both physical and
culturological, which could make such a threat even more pertinent on an
average Galactic terrestrial planet than on Earth.

structural parameter of the logistic map along with the initial value $x_1$
considered as an additional unknown parameter. Comparisons with previously
proposed techniques on simulated numerical examples give favorable results (at
least, for the investigated combinations of sample size $N$ and noise level).
Besides, unlike some suggested techniques, our method does not require the a
priori knowledge of the noise variance. We also clarify the nature of the
inherent difficulties in the statistical analysis of deterministically chaotic
time series and the status of previously proposed Bayesian approaches. We note
the trade-off between the need of using a large number of data points in the ML
analysis to decrease the bias (to guarantee consistency of the estimation) and
the unstable nature of dynamical trajectories with exponentially fast loss of
memory of the initial condition. The method of statistical moments for the
estimation of the parameter of the logistic map is discussed. This method seems
to be the unique method whose consistency for deterministically chaotic time
series is proved so far theoretically (not only numerically).

prove an analog of Wigner's inequality for conditional probabilities and by
using this inequality show that predictions of the conventional and quantum

between neighbouring atoms in the lattice and their massively parallel
operation allows the creation of highly entangled states in a single
operational step, independent of the size of the system. In the experiment, we
observe a coherent entangling-disentangling evolution in the many-body system

present novel opportunities for theory and experiment.

The canonical formalism realizes nontrivial mixings of pairs of conjugate
quadratures of the electromagnetic field in terms of homodyne variables for
single-mode systems; and in terms of heterodyne variables for multimode
systems. In the first instance the transformations yield nonquadratic model
Hamiltonians of degenerate multiphoton processes and define a class of non
Gaussian, nonclassical multiphoton states that exhibit properties of coherence
and squeezing. We show that such homodyne multiphoton squeezed states are
generated by unitary operators with a nonlinear time evolution that realizes
the homodyne mixing of a pair of conjugate quadratures. Tuning of the local
oscillator angle allows to vary at will the statistical properties of such
states. We discuss the relevance of the formalism for the study of degenerate
(up-)down-conversion processes. In a companion paper, ``Structure of

canonical formalism to multimode systems, we introduce the associated

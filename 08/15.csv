of debris disks. Clumps arise because after a planetary system forms its
planets migrate due to angular momentum exchange with the remaining
planetesimals. Outward migration of the outermost planet traps planetesimals
outside its orbit into its resonances and resonant forces cause azimuthal
structure in their distribution. The model is based on numerical simulations of
planets of different masses, Mpl, migrating at different rates, dapl/dt,
through a dynamically cold (e<0.01) planetesimal disk initially at a semimajor
axis a. Trapping probabilities and the resulting azimuthal structures are
presented for a planet's 2:1, 5:3, 3:2, and 4:3 resonances. Seven possible
dynamical structures are identified from migrations defined by mu=Mpl/Mstar and
theta=dapl/dt*sqrt(a/Mstar). Application of this model to the 850um image of
Vega's disk shows its two clumps of unequal brightness can be explained by the
migration of a Neptune-mass planet from 40 to 65AU over 56Myr; tight
constraints are set on possible ranges of these parameters. The clumps are
caused by planetesimals in the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances; the asymmetry arises
because of the overabundance of planetesimals in the 2:1(u) over the 2:1(l)
resonance. The similarity of this migration to that proposed for our own
Neptune hints that Vega's planetary system may be much more akin to the solar
system than previously thought. Predictions are made which would substantiate
this model, such as the orbital motion of the clumpy pattern, the location of
the planet, and the presence of lower level clumps.

Working
with XMM data we examine the distribution and properties of the hot gas which
makes up the group halo. The inner halo shows some signs of structure, with
circular or elliptical beta models providing a poor fit to the surface
brightness profile. This may be evidence of large scale motion in the inner
halo, but we do not find evidence of sharp fronts or edges in the emission. The
temperature of the halo declines in the core, with deprojected spectral fits
showing a central temperature of ~1.3 keV compared to ~3 keV at 100 kpc. In the
central ~30 kpc of the group multi-temperature spectral models are required to
fit the data, but they indicate a lack of gas at low temperatures. Steady state
cooling flow models provide poor fits to the inner regions of the group and the
estimated cooling time of the gas is long except within the central dominant
galaxy, NGC 4073. Abundance profiles show a sharp increase in the core of the
group, with mean abundance rising by a factor of two in the centre of NGC 4073.
Fitting individual elements shows the same trend, with high values of Fe, Si
and S in the core. We estimate that ~50% of the Fe in the central 40 kpc was
injected by SNIa, in agreement with previous ASCA studies. Using our best
fitting surface brightness and temperature models, we calculate the mass, gas
fraction, entropy and mass-to-light ratio of the group. At 100 kpc (~0.1 virial
radii) the total mass and gas entropy of the system (~2x10^13 Msol and ~300 keV
cm^2) are quite comparable to those of other systems of similar temperature,
but the gas fraction is rather low (~1%). We conclude that MKW 4 is a fairly
relaxed group, which has developed a strong central temperature gradient but
not a large-scale cooling flow.

1797, with diameter of about 3 pc, is similar to the ultra compact H II regions
already known in the SMC. Stellar analysis is presented, and approximate

Limited analysis of their stellar content and their ionized radiation shows
that these compact H II regions are ionized by small stellar clusters whose
hottest stars are at most of the B0 class. These very compact, extremely

that main-sequence stars with initial mass <= 8 M_sun become white dwarfs. We
suggest that this lack of white dwarfs is due at least in part to dynamical
processes. Non-spherically symmetric mass loss during the post-main-sequence
evolution would lead to a few km/s isotropic recoil speed for the white dwarf
remnant. This recoil speed can cause a substantial fraction of the white dwarfs
formed in a cluster to leave the system. We investigate this dynamical process
by carrying out high-precision N-body simulations of intermediate-mass open
clusters, where we apply an isotropic recoil speed to the white dwarf remnants.
Our models suggest that almost all white dwarfs would be lost from the cluster
if the average recoil speed exceeds twice the velocity dispersion of the
cluster.

the high gaseous (ram pressure and static thermal) pressure of the ICM strongly
compresses a self-gravitating gas cloud within a short time scale ($\sim$
$10^{7}$ yr), dramatically increasing the central gas density, and consequently
causing efficient star formation within the cloud. The stars developed in the
cloud form a compact, gravitationally bound, star cluster. The star formation
efficiency within such a cloud is found to depend on the temperature and the
density of the ICM and the relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to it.
Based on these results, we discuss the origin of starburst/poststarburst
populations observed in distant clusters, the enhancement of star formation for

into stellar evolution models. The approach involves enhancing the metal
content of the surface layers of stellar models. In addition, the surface
layers of stars in the mass range of 0.5-2.0 Solar masses are mixed to an
artificial depth motivated by observations of lithium abundance. The behavior
of polluted stellar evolution models is explored assuming the pollution occurs
after the star has left the fully convective pre main sequence phase. Stellar
models polluted with a few Earth masses of iron are significantly hotter than
stars of the same mass with an equivalent bulk metallicity. Polluted stellar
evolution models can successfully reproduce the metal-rich, parent star tau
Bootis and suggest a slightly lower mass than standard evolution models.
Finally, the possibility that stars in the Hyades open cluster have accreted an
average of 0.5 Earth masses of iron is explored. The results indicate that it
is not possible to rule out stellar pollution on this scale from the scatter of

stellar pollution studies because all of the stars have essentially the same
age and were born from the same cloud of gas. Furthermore, with an age of
roughly 650 Myr most of the intermediate and low mass stars are on the main
sequence. Given these assumptions, the accretion of metal rich material onto
the surface of a star during and shortly after the formation of planetary
systems should be evident via the enhanced metallicity of the star. Building on
previous work, stellar evolution models which include the effects of stellar
pollution are applied to the Hyades. The results of several Monte Carlo
simulations, in which the amount of accreted material is drawn at random from a
Gaussian distribution with standard deviation equal to half the mean, are
presented. An effective temperature-[Fe/H] relation is produced and compared to
recent observations. The theoretical predictions presented in this letter will
be useful in future searches for evidence of stellar pollution due to planet
formation. It is concluded that stellar pollution effects at the mean level of
>=2 Earth masses of iron are ruled out by current observational data.

elliptical galaxies formed, focusing on the globular clusters. Several
observational evidences show that massive elliptical galaxies formed at $z>2$
($>10$ Gyr ago). Giant elliptical galaxies show mostly a bimodal color
distribution of globular clusters, indicating a factor of $\approx 20$
metallicity difference between the two peaks. The red globular clusters (RGCs)
are closely related with the stellar halo in color and spatial distribution,
while the blue globular clusters (BGCs) are not. The ratio of the number of the
RGCs and that of the BGCs varies depending on galaxies. It is concluded that
the BGCs might have formed 12--13 Gyr ago, while the RGCs and giant elliptical
galaxies might have formed similarly 10-11 Gyr ago. It remains now to explain
the existence of a gap between the RGC formation epoch and the BGC formation
epoch, and the rapid metallicity increase during the gap ($\Delta t \approx 2$
Gyr). If hierarchical merging can form a significant number of giant elliptical
galaxies $>10$ Gyr ago, several observational constraints from stars and
globular clusters in elliptical galaxies can be explained.

geodesic of the Schwarzschild background, to a first approximation. If the
interaction of the particle with its own field (scalar, electromagnetic or
gravitational) is taken into account, the path is no longer a background
geodesic and the self-force that the particle experiences needs to be taken
into consideration.
  In this dissertation, a recently proposed method for the calculation of the
self-force is implemented. According to this method the self-force comes from
the interaction of the particle with the Regular-Remainder scalar field,
electromagnetic potential or metric perturbation. That Regular-Remainder is
obtained by subtracting the Singular part (which exerts no force) from the
retarded scalar field, electromagnetic potential of metric perturbation
generated by the moving particle. First, the Singular scalar fields,
electromagnetic potentials and metric perturbations are calculated for
different sources moving in a Schwarzschild background. For that, the
Thorne-Hartle-Zhang coordinates in the vicinity of the moving source are used.
Then a mode-sum regularization method initially proposed for the direct scalar
field is followed, and the regularization parameters for the singular part of
the scalar field and for the first radial derivative of the singular part of
the self-force are calculated. Also, the numerical calculation of the retarded
scalar field for a particle moving on a circular geodesic in a Schwarzschild
spacetime is presented. Finally, the self-force for a scalar particle moving on
a circular Schwarzschild orbit is calculated and some results about the effects
of the self-force on the orbital frequency of the circular orbit are presented.

interpretation of its degrees of freedom. The basic idea is to dress the
plaquettes of the lattice to view them as elementary homotopies between nearby
paths. Instead of using a unique $G$-valued field to discretize the connection
1-form, $A$, we use an $\AG$-valued field $U$ on the edges, which plays the
role of the 1-form $\ad_A$, and a $G$-valued field $V$ on the plaquettes, which
corresponds to the Faraday tensor, $F$. The 1-connection, $U$, and the
2-connection, $V$, are then supposed to have a 2-curvature which vanishes. This
constraint determines $V$ as a function of $U$ up to a phase in $Z(G)$, the
center of $G$. The 3-curvature around a cube is then Abelian and is interpreted
as the magnetic charge contained inside this cube. Promoting the plaquettes to
elementary homotopies induces a chiral splitting of their usual Boltzmann
weight, $w=v\bar{v}$, defined with the Wilson action. We compute the Fourier
transform, $\hat{v}$, of this chiral Boltzmann weight on $G=SU_3$ and we obtain
a finite sum of generalized hypergeometric functions. The dual model describes
the dynamics of three spin fields : $\lambda_P\in{\hat{G}}$ and
$m_P\in{\hat{Z(G)}}\simeq\Z_3$, on each oriented plaquette $P$, and
$\epsilon_{ab}\in{\hat{\OG}}\simeq\Z_2$, on each oriented edge $(ab)$. Finally,
we sketch a geometric interpretation of this spin system in a fibered category
modeled on the category of representations of $G$.

corresponding to D-branes are given by vacuum wavefunctionals of the gauge

the Cardy condition, are shown to arise through compatibility relations between
the orbifold charges and bulk gauge invariance. We show that with a further
conformally-invariant coupling to a dynamical massless scalar field theory in

the first proof, coupled with results of Chari, leads to a proof of the
g-inequalities for general matroid complexes, which is a recent result of

proposed. A klystron amplifier has the useful property that the various
electronic processes take place in separate portions of the amplifier, rather
than overlapping as in FEL amplifier with an uniform undulator. The klystron
consists of two fundamental parts: succession of 2-3 cascades (modulator), and
an output undulator (radiator) in which the modulated electron beam coherently
radiates. Each cascade consists of uniform undulator and dispersion section.
Unlike distributed optical klystrons, we have a high gain per cascade pass.
This has a few consequences. First, klystron gain does not depend on the bunch
compression in the injector linac, i.e. maximum gain per cascade pass at high
peak beam current is the same as at low peak beam current, without compression.
Conventional, short-wavelength FEL amplifier and distributed optical klystron
require electron beam peak current of a few kA. Second, there are no
requirements on the alignment of the cascade undulators and dispersion
sections, because, in our (high gain) case, there is no need for radiation
phase matching. There are applications, like XFELs, where the unique properties
of high gain klystron FEL amplifier are very desirable. Such a scheme allows
one to decrease the total length of the magnetic system. In this paper we
discuss also implementation of the proposed SASE FEL scheme for the frequency
multiplier, for femtosecond experiments, and multi-user soft X-ray facility.

the exact short time behavior, while at longer time their results deviate from
the exact one. The CMD correlation function damps rapidly with time because of
ensemble dephasing. The EPAC correlation function, however, can reproduce the
long time oscillation inherent in the quantum double well systems. It is also
shown that the EPAC correlation function can be improved toward the exact
correlation function by means of the higher order derivative expansion of the

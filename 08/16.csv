  The decay of half of the GRB radio afterglows with long temporal monitoring
is significantly slower than at optical frequencies, contrary to what is
expected in the simplest fireball model. We investigate four ways to decouple
the radio and optical decays: an evolving index of the power-law distribution
of the shock-accelerated electrons, the presence of a spectral break between
the two domains, a structured outflow, and a long-lived reverse shock
contribution to the afterglow emission. [...]
  In the fourth scenario, it is assumed that the radio afterglow emission
arises in the reverse shock propagating in a steady stream of ejecta, which
catch up with the decelerating GRB remnant. This scenario can accommodate the
properties of the afterglows with slow radio decays and requires that the
injected energy is less than or comparable to the initial fireball energy,
while other afterglow parameters have reasonable values.
  For a jet, the transition to a semi-relativistic motion mitigates the radio
decay, however this scenario would work only when the slower radio decay is
observed well after the steeper optical fall-off. A structured outflow with a
relativistic core, yielding a fast decaying optical emission, and a
non-relativistic envelope, producing a slowly falling-off radio afterglow, is
not a viable solution, as it fails to decouple the radio and optical decays.

mJy. This is one of the most luminous stellar radio flares ever observed.
Remarkably, the Chandra X-ray observatory was in the midst of a deep

X-ray flux increased by a factor of 10 approximately 2 days before the radio
detection. Follow-up radio observations with the VLA and BIMA showed that the
source decayed on a timescale of days, then flared again several times over the
next 70 days, although never as brightly as during the discovery. Circular
polarization was detected at 15, 22, and 43 GHz, indicating that the emission
mechanism was cyclotron. VLBA observations 9 days after the initial flare yield
a brightness temperature Tb > 5 x 10^7 K at 15 GHz. Infrared spectroscopy
indicates the source is a K5V star with faint Br gamma emission, suggesting
that it is a weak-line T Tauri object. Zeeman splitting measurements in the

long-term variability between this observation and the 1991 ROSAT and 1993/2000

IC342 X-2 is is found to be in its the lowest luminosity state observed for X-2
to date, although the slope of the spectrum is intermediate between the
previously observed low/hard and high/soft states. IC342 X-1, on the other
hand, is found to be in an identical state to that observed in 2000 with ASCA.
Assuming X-1 is in an anomalous very high (VH) state, then either (1) X-1 has

also confirmed the ROSAT HRI result that the nucleus of IC342 is made up of

The mosaic encompasses 147 K-band sources as well as the molecular ridge seen
previously in dust continuum emission. We detect 10 point-like sources in 3mm
continuum emission above the level of 5-sigma within the unit gain region of
the mosaic. One of these sources corresponds to the near-IR source IRS 2, an
early B-type star. Two other sources are tentatively associated with low-mass
near-IR cluster members, and the remaining 7 sources have no K-band
counterparts. Assuming the millimeter continuum point sources represent
emission from circumstellar disks and/or envelopes, then ~6% of the total
population (infrared and millimeter sources) in the NGC 2024 mosaic has a
circumstellar mass in excess of ~0.06 solar masses. We obtain further
constraints on the average circumstellar disk mass by considering the mean
millimeter continuum flux observed toward a sample of 140 K-band sources that
likely have stellar masses <1-2 Msun. While none of these sources are detected
individually above the 3-sigma limit of ~0.035 Msun, the ensemble of sources

frequency of massive disks/envelopes and has a higher mean disk mass by a
factor of 2.5 +/- 1.3 among K-band sources, suggesting that the mean
circumstellar mass is decreasing with cluster age. We also compare the results
for the NGC 2024 and IC 348 clusters to those for the lower-density Taurus star
forming region.

long periods, exceeding 3 years, and consequently their semi-major axes are
around or above 2 AU. The detected companions have minimum masses m2sini
ranging from slightly more than 2 M_Jup to 10.6 M_Jup. These additional objects
reinforce the conclusion that most planetary companions have masses lower than
5 M_Jup but with a tail of the mass distribution going up above 15 M_Jup. The

CP phases on the supersymmetric contributions are found to be significanlty
large for the b quark mass as they can change both its sign and its magnitude.
Thus with the inclusion of CP phases the supersymmetric correction to the b
quark mass can be as much as fifty percent or more of the total b quark mass.
For the case of the $\tau$ lepton, the effects of CP phases on the
supersymmetric correction is also relatively large as it can again affect both
the sign and the magnitude of the $\tau$ mass correction. However, in this case
the overall correction is found to be only a few percent. The effect of CP

foundations to the modern non-commutative theories. We also indicate possible
applications in the Dirac-like theories.

disciplines may usefully be understood as information compression (IC) by
'multiple alignment', 'unification' and 'search' (ICMAUS)"".
  As a preparation for the two main sections of the article, concepts of
information and information compression are reviewed. Related areas of research
are also described including IC in brains and nervous systems, and IC in
relation to inductive inference, Minimum Length Encoding and probabilistic
reasoning. The ICMAUS concepts and a computer model in which they are embodied
are briefly described.
  The first of the two main sections describes how many of the commonly-used
forms and structures in mathematics, logic and related disciplines (such as
theoretical linguistics and computer programming) may be seen as devices for
IC. In some cases, these forms and structures may be interpreted in terms of
the ICMAUS framework.
  The second main section describes a selection of examples where processes of
calculation and inference in mathematics, logic and related disciplines may be
understood as IC. In many cases, these examples may be understood more
specifically in terms of the ICMAUS concepts.

combining Littelmann's path model with the Kyoto path model. The vertices of

call skeins.
  We apply this model to the case when the corresponding finite-dimensional
algebra g has a minuscule representation (classical type and E_6, E_7). We
prove that the basic level-one representation of g^, when considered as a
representation of g, is an infinite tensor product of fundamental
representations of g. A similar tensor product phenomenon holds for certain
Demazure submodules of the basic representation.

stationary process for a polynuclear growth model. Adler and van Moerbeke found
a PDE in the variables s_1, s_2, and t for the probability that A(0)<s_1 and
A(t)<s_2. Using this they were able, assuming the truth of a certain conjecture
and appropriate uniformity, to obtain the first few terms of an asymptotic
expansion for this probability as t->infinity, with fixed s_1 and s_2. We shall
show that the expansion can be obtained by using the Fredholm determinant
representation for the probability. The main ingredients are formulas obtained
by the author and C. A. Tracy in the derivation of the Painlev\'e II
representation for the distribution function F_2 plus a few others obtained in
the same way.

peaks where two nucleons each have 20% or less, and the third nucleon has most
of the transferred energy. These fast pp and pn pairs are back-to-back with
little momentum along the three-momentum transfer, indicating that they are
spectators. Experimental and theoretical evidence indicates that we have
measured distorted two-nucleon momentum distributions by striking the third
nucleon and detecting the spectator correlated pair.

through models based on globally- and time-averaged quantities. We examine here
a simple 864-cell climatological model that emphasizes vertical radiative
energy transport within each cell. It reproduces yearly average temperatures
obtained earlier from one of these global models and predicts a locally
distributed non-radiative flux when observed temperatures are employed as input
data. Vertical and lateral transport of latent heat do not appear explicitly in
this model. They are apparently handled well by one non-radiative flux
variable, SNR, which shows a strong latitude dependence. Only the Sahara desert
and Saudi Arabian regions appear to be complex. For those interested in
climatology and construction of climate models, our model provides constraints
upon specifying averaged non-radiative energy transport. The model is a useful
simplification for learning about radiative energy transfer into and out of
Earth?s atmosphere and for representing the results of more sophisticated
models.

of a-priori expectations about the presence of a signal, thus allowing the
determination of a single set of cuts that is optimal both for setting limits
and for making a discovery. Simple approximate formulas are given for the
common problem of Poisson counts with background.

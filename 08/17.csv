presented. A1644 is a complex merging system consisting of a main and a sub
cluster. A trail of cool, metal-rich gas has been discovered close to the sub
cluster. The combination of results from X-ray, optical, and radio data, and a
comparison to a hydrodynamical simulation suggest that the sub cluster has
passed by the main cluster off-axis and a fraction of its gas has been stripped
off during this process. Furthermore, for this merging system, simple effects
are illustrated which can affect the use of clusters as cosmological probes.
Specifically, double clusters may affect estimates of the cluster number
density when treated as a single system. Mergers, as well as cool cores, can
alter the X-ray luminosity and temperature measured for clusters, causing these
values to differ from those expected in equilibrium.

identifications are briefly reviewed, and a summary of the area covered, and
completeness limit for each infrared band is given. A detailed discussion of
the band-merging and optical association strategy is given. The total
catalogues consists of 2860 sources. For extragalactic sources observed in 3 or
more infrared bands, colour-colour diagrams are presented and discussed in
terms of the contributing infrared populations. Spectral energy distributions
are shown for selected sources and compared with cirrus, M82 and Arp220
starburst, and AGN dust torus models.
  Spectroscopic redshifts are tabulated, where available. For the N1 and N2
areas, the INT ugriz Wide Field Survey, permits photometric redshifts to be
estimated for galaxies and quasars. These agree well with the spectroscopic
redshifts, within the uncertainty of the photometric method. The redshift
distribution is given for selected ELAIS bands and colour-redshift diagrams are
discussed.
  There is a high proportion of ultraluminous infrared galaxies in the ELAIS
Catalogue ($> 10 %$ of 15 $\mu$m sources), many with Arp220-like colours. 10
hyperluminous infrared galaxies and 10 EROs are found in the survey. The large
numbers of ultraluminous galaxies imply very strong evolution in the
star-formation rate between z = 0 and 1.

(BALQSOs), it is possible to reveal key properties of the outflowing gas in the
inner regions of these objects. This results from the fact that each image of
the quasar corresponds to a different line of sight through the outflow. This
combined with dynamical estimates for the location of the flow, adds new
information concerning the lateral, non line of sight structure of the
absorbing gas. Here we consider a sample of lensed BALQSOs and note that the
similarity of BAL profiles of different images of the same quasar implies that
the flow is relatively isotropic on small scales. We show that its geometry is
inconsistent with the ballistically accelerated spherical cloud model, and that
wind models provide a better description of the flow structure. Furthermore,
observations seem to disagree with naive interpretations of recent
time-dependent wind simulations. This may hint on several important physical
processes that govern the structure and dynamics of such flows. Future
prospects for the study of quasar outflows with the effect of strong
gravitational lensing are discussed.

long wire-like states obtained by the evaporation-deposition of silver on the

adjacent wires that can be understood based on a purely kinetic mechanism. We
also compare these correlations quantitatively to those obtained from
simulations done with the relevant experimental parameters and find them in
good agreement.

macroscopically definable ensembles are described. These are ensembles with
macroscopically prepared initial states. The method for computing trajectories
of primitive macroscopically definable nonequilibrium ensembles is elaborated.
These trajectories are represented as sequences of deformed equilibrium
ensembles and simple quadratic models between them. The primitive
macroscopically definable ensembles form the manifold in the space of
ensembles. We call this manifold the film of nonequilibrium states. The
equation for the film and the equation for the ensemble motion on the film are
written down. The notion of the invariant film of non-equilibrium states, and
the method of its approximate construction transform the the problem of
nonequilibrium kinetics into a series of problems of equilibrium statistical
physics. The developed methods allow us to solve the problem of macro-kinetics
even when there are no autonomous equations of macro-kinetics.

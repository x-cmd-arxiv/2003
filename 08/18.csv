  binary pulsar system with double spins","6 pages, 1 figure",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The measurability of the spin--orbit (S--L) coupling induced orbital effect
is dependent on the orientation and magnitude of the orbital precession
velocity, ${\bf \Omega}_0$. This paper derives ${\bf \Omega}_0$ in the case
that both spins in the binary system contribute to the spin--orbit (S--L)
coupling, which is suitable for the most popular binary pulsars, Neutron
star--White Dwarf star (NS--WD) binaries (as well as for NS--NS binaries). This
paper shows that from two constraints, the conservation of the total angular
momentum and the triangle formed by the orbital angular momentum, ${\bf L}$,
the sum the spin angular momenta of the two stars, ${\bf S}$, and the total
angular momentum, ${\bf J}$, the orbital precession velocity, ${\bf \Omega}_0$,
along ${\bf J}$ is inevitable. Moreover, by the relation, $S/L\ll 1$, which is
satisfied for a general binary pulsar, a significant ${\bf \Omega}_0$ (in
magnitude) is inevitable, 1.5 Post Newtonian order (PN). Which are similar to
the case of one spin as discussed by many authors. However unlike the one spin
case, the magnitude of the precession velocity of ${\bf \Omega}_0$ varies
significantly due to the variation of the sum the spin angular momenta of the
two stars, ${\bf S}$, which can lead to significant secular variabilities in
binary pulsars.

tight constraints on cosmological parameters such as the equation of state of
dark energy. In this paper, we study the impact of relativistic corrections of
the thermal SZE on the cluster number counts expected from a cosmological model
and thus, assuming that other cosmological parameters are known to high
accuracies, on the determination of the $w$ parameter and $\sigma_8$ from a SZE
cluster survey, where $w=p/\rho$ with $p$ the pressure and $\rho$ the density
of dark energy, and $\sigma_8$ is the rms of the extrapolated linear density
fluctuation smoothed over $8\hbox{Mpc}h^{-1}$. For the purpose of illustrating
the effects of relativistic corrections, our analyses mainly focus on $\nu=353
\hbox{GHz}$ and $S_{lim}=30\hbox{mJy}$, where $\nu$ and $S_{lim}$ are the
observing frequency and the flux limit of a survey, respectively. These
observing parameters are relevant to the {\it Planck} survey. It is found that
from two measurable quantities, the total number of SZE clusters and the number
of clusters with redshift $z\ge 0.5$, $\sigma_8$ and $w$ can be determined to a
level of $\pm 1%$ and $\pm 8%$, respectively, with $1\sigma$ uncertainties from
a survey of $10000\hbox{deg}^2$. Relativistic effects are important in
determining the central values of $\sigma_8$ and $w$. If we choose the two
quantities calculated relativistically from the flat cosmological model with
$\sigma_8=0.8284$ and $w=-0.75$ as input, the derived $\sigma_8$ and $w$ would
be 0.819 and -0.81, respectively, if relativistic effects are wrongly
neglected. The location of the resulting $\sigma_8$ and $w$ in the $\sigma_8-w$
plane is outside the $3\sigma$ region around the real central $\sigma_8$ and
$w$.

function at z~6 of beta>-3.0 (90%) using gravitational lensing constraints to
build on the limit of beta>-3.3 (90%) derived from an analysis of the
luminosity distribution (Fan et al. 2003). This tight constraint is obtained by
noting that of the two quasars which are lensed by foreground galaxies, neither
are multiply imaged. These observations are surprising if the luminosity
function is steep because magnification bias results in an overabundance of
multiply imaged relative to singly imaged lensed quasars. Our Bayesian analysis
uses the a-posteriori information regarding alignments with foreground galaxies
of the two lensed quasars, and provides a constraint on beta that is nearly
independent of the uncertain evolution in the lens population. The results
suggest that the bright end of the quasar luminosity function continues to
flatten out to z~6, as is observed between z~3 and z~5 (Fan et al. 2001).
Provided that SDSS J1148-5251 at z=6.37 is magnified by an intervening lens
galaxy at z~5 (White et al. 2003), we also show that the high lens redshift in
this system implies a co-moving density of massive galaxies that is close to
constant out to high redshift. This is in agreement with the lack of redshift
evolution in the velocity function of dark-matter halos with velocity
dispersions near 200 km/sec as predicted by the Press-Schechter formalism. The
combination of constraints on the quasar luminosity function and lens galaxy
evolution are used to compute an improved estimate for the z~6 multiple image

[C. Beck and E.G.D. Cohen, Physica A 322, 267 (2003)], used to interpret
unconventional statistics. Their interpretation is that unconventional
statistics in dynamical systems arise as weighted averages of the ordinary
statistics obeyed by these systems over a statistical distribution of
background configurations due to fluctuations intrinsic to the background. In
this paper we suggest that the same picture can arise because of the intrinsic
dynamics of the system. The dynamics of the system and the background, hence,
concur together to determine the overall final statistics: differently evolving
systems embedded within the same background can yield different statistical
distributions. Some simple examples are provided; among them a toy model able
to yield a power-law distribution. Also, some recent independent results are
quoted, that appear to support this viewpoint.

receptor (CSR) and subsequent signal transduction is known to be enhanced by
Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs). HSPGs bind FGF-2 with low affinity and
likely impact CSR-mediated signaling via stabilization of FGF-2-CSR complexes
via association with both the ligand and the receptor. What is unknown is
whether HSPG associates with CSR in the absence of FGF-2. In this paper, we
determine conditions by which pre-association would impact CSR-FGF-2-HSPG triad
formation assuming diffusion-limited surface reactions. Using mean-field rate
equations, we show that (i) when [HSPG] is much higher than [CSR], the presence
of pre-formed complexes does not affect the steady state of FGF-2 binding, and
(ii) when the concentrations are comparable, the presence of pre-formed
complexes substantially increases the steady state concentration of FGF-2 bound
to CSR. These findings are supported by explicit cellular automaton
simulations, which justify the mean-field treatment. We discuss the advantages
of such a two-receptor system compared to a single receptor model, when the
parameters are comparable. Further, we speculate that the observed high
concentration of HSPG in intact cells ([HSPG] ~ 100[CSR]) provides a way to
ensure that the binding levels of FGF-2 to its signaling receptor remains high,
irrespective of the presence of pre-formed CSR-HSPG complexes on the cell
surface, while allowing the cell to finely tune the response to FGF-2 via
down-regulation of the signaling receptor.

evaded if the curvaton field (or an associated tachyon) is strongly coupled to
a field which acquires a large value at the end of inflation. As a result the

inflation models, in which the supersymmetry-breaking mechanism is the same as

Paris, 337, 481-486 (2003)",,,"math.PR math-ph math.MP",,"  In this research announcement, we show that SLE curves can in fact be viewed
as boundaries of certain simple Poissonian percolation clusters: Recall that
the Brownian loop-soup (introduced in the paper arxiv:math.PR/0304419 with Greg
Lawler) with intensity c defines a Poissonian collection of (simple if one
focuses only on the outer boundary) loops in a domain. This random family of
(possibly intersecting) loops is conformally invariant (and there are almost
surely infinitely many small loops in any sample). We show that there exists a
critical value a in (0,1] such that if one colors all the interiors of the
loops, the obtained clusters are bounded when c<a, whereas when c>a, one single
cluster fills the domain. We prove that for small c, the outer boundaries of
the clusters are SLE-type curves where $\kappa \le 4$ and $c$ related by the
usual relation $c=(3\kappa-8)(6-\kappa)/2\kappa$ (i.e. c corresponds to the
central charge of the model). Conjecturally, the critical value a is equal to
one and corresponds to SLE4 loops, so that this should give for any c in (0,1]
a construction of a natural countable family of random disjoint SLE$_\kappa$
loops (i.e. $\kappa$ should span $(8/3,4]$), that behaves ``nicely'' under
perturbation of the domain.
  A precise relation between chordal SLE and the loop-soup goes as follows:
Consider the sample of a certain restriction measure (i.e. a certain union of
Brownian excursions) in a domain, attach to it all the above-described clusters
that it intersects. The outer boundary of the obtained set is exactly an
SLE$_\kappa$, if the restriction measure exponent is equal to the
highest-weight of the corresponding representation with central charge c.

many-body problem (quantum hadrodynamics or QHD) is discussed. The effective
field theory studied here contains nucleons, pions, isoscalar scalar (\sigma)
and vector (\omega) fields, and isovector vector (\rho) fields. The theory
exhibits a nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R
chiral symmetry and has three desirable features: it uses the same degrees of
freedom to describe the nuclear currents and the strong-interaction dynamics,
it satisfies the symmetries of the underlying theory of QCD, and its parameters
can be calibrated using strong-interaction phenomena, like hadron scattering or
the empirical properties of finite nuclei. Moreover, it has recently been
verified that for normal nuclear systems, it is possible to expand the
effective Lagrangian systematically in powers of the meson fields (and their
derivatives) and to truncate the expansion reliably after the first few orders.
Using a mean-field version of the energy functional, accurate quantitative
results are obtained for the bulk and single-particle properties of medium- and
heavy-mass nuclei. The importance of modern perspectives in effective field
theory and density functional theory for understanding these successes of QHD
is emphasized. The inclusion of hadronic electromagnetic structure and of
nonanalytic terms in the energy functional is also considered briefly. As a
further application, weak-interaction currents are studied in the QHD
framework. The axial-vector current, evaluated through the leading order in the
field expansion, satisfies both PCAC and the Goldberger--Treiman relation, and
the corresponding vector and axial-vector charges satisfy the familiar chiral
charge algebra to all orders in the pion field.

variety of experimental, theoretical and numerical investigations. Most
numerical and theoretical investigations have examined infinite systems
assuming periodic boundary conditions. Since experimentally observed crystals
can be comprised of a few hundred particles, this often leads to discrepancies
between predicted theoretical results and experimental data. In addition,
recent studies have concentrated on the importance of random charge variations
between individual dust particles, but very little on the importance of size
variations between the grains. Such size variations naturally lead to
inter-grain charge variations which can easily become more important than those
due to random charge fluctuations (which are typically less than one percent).
Although such size variations can be largely eliminated experimentally by
introducing mono-dispersive particles, many laboratory systems and all
astrophysical environments contain significant size distributions. This study
utilizes a program to find the equilibrium positions of a dusty plasma system
as well as a modified Barnes-Hut code to model the dynamic behavior of such
systems. It is shown that in terms of inter-particle spacing and ordering,
finite systems are significantly different than infinite ones, particularly for
the most-highly ordered states.

Bowen","Teleportation of continuous variable polarisation states",,"Physical Review A 68, 052308 (2003)","10.1103/PhysRevA.68.052308",,"quant-ph",,"  This paper discusses methods for the optical teleportation of continuous
variable polarisation states. We show that using two pairs of entangled beams,
generated using four squeezed beams, perfect teleportation of optical
polarisation states can be performed. Restricting ourselves to 3 squeezed
beams, we demonstrate that polarisation state teleportation can still exceed
the classical limit. The 3-squeezer schemes involve either the use of quantum
non-demolition measurement or biased entanglement generated from a single
squeezed beam. We analyse the efficacies of these schemes in terms of fidelity,
signal transfer coefficients and quantum correlations.

A, vol. 68, pp. 062314/1-4, 2003","10.1103/PhysRevA.68.062314",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a directly measurable criterion for the entanglement of two
qubits. We compare the criterion with other criteria, and we find that for pure
states, and some mixed states, it coincides with the state's concurrency. The
measure can be obtained with a Bell state analyser and the ability to make
general local unitary transformations. However, the procedure fails to measure
the entanglement of a general mixed two-qubit state.

photons have the same operator structure and may differ from each other only by
spatial dependence in the very vicinity of the atom. It is shown that the
photon twins created by a dipole forbidden transition can manifest the maximum
entanglement with respect to the angular momentum. It is shown that the states
of photons with projection of angular momentum $m=0$ are less stable than those
with $m= \pm 1$.

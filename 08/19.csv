circular polarisation at any point in space, due to the forward throwing nature

produce a fairly high percentage of net circular polarisation (~10%) and may
therefore play a key role in producing an enantiomeric excess.

energy band (i) is where the vast majority of radiative luminosity is observed,
and (ii) is intimately connected to the pair winds that form the dominant mode
of energy deposition in the circum-pulsar environment. The most crucial point
of contention pertaining to the high energy astrophysics of pulsars is the
location of the acceleration region in their magnetospheres: is an outer gap
model or a polar cap scenario (or both) the most appropriate picture. Radiative
signatures provide the clues to this current enigma. This review focuses on
salient characteristics of the polar cap scenario; these form the basis for
discriminating observational diagnostics that should drive pulsars studies in

counteracted by the beam divergence in between clumps (more precisely, the
average reciprocal magnification cancels the inverse Dyer-Roeder
demagnification). This conclusion is in fact independent of the matter density
function within each clump, and remains valid for arbitrary densities of matter
and dark energy. When tested against the CMB, a rather large lensing induced
{\it dispersion} in the angular size of the primary acoustic peaks of the TT
power spectrum is inconsistent with WMAP observations. The situation is
unchanged by the use of NFW profiles for the density distribution of groups.
Finally, our formulae are applied to an ensemble of NFW mass clumps or
isothermal spheres having the parameters of galaxy {\it clusters}. The acoustic
peak size dispersion remains unobservably large, and is also excluded by WMAP.
For galaxy groups, two possible ways of reconciling with the data are proposed,
both exploiting maximally the uncertainties in our knowledge of group
properties. The same escape routes are not available in the case of clusters,
however, because their properties are well understood. Here we have a more
robust conclusion: neither of the widely accepted models are good description
of clusters, or important elements of physics responsible for shaping zero
curvature space are missing from the standard cosmological model. When all the
effects are accrued, it is difficult to understand how WMAP could reveal no
evidence whatsoever of lensing by groups and clusters.

4365, the best-fit core radius is very small, while the S0 galaxy NGC 4382 has

favor sources in an early stage of evolution. The integrated intensity of CS
J=5-4 correlates very well with the dust continuum emission at 350 microns. The

find a weak correlation between C34S linewidth and size, consistent with Dv ~

relations between linewidth and size determined from regions of lower mass.
These regions are very turbulent. The derived virial mass agrees within a
factor of 2 to 3 with mass estimates from dust emission at 350 microns after
corrections for the density structure are accounted for. The resulting
cumulative mass spectrum of cores above 1000 solar masses can be approximated
by a power law with a slope of about -0.9, steeper than that of clouds measured
with tracers of lower density gas and close to that for the total masses of
stars in OB associations. The median turbulent pressures are comparable to
those in UCHII regions, and the pressures at small radii are similar to those
in hypercompact-HII regions (P/k ~ 10^{10} K cm^{-3}). The filling factors for
dense gas are substantial, and the median abundance of CS is about 10^{-9}. The
ratio of bolometric luminosity to virial mass is much higher than the value

aurora-like emission, increasing the effective atmospheric transmission by many
orders of magnitude. Depending on the presence of molecular UV absorbers and
atmospheric thickness, up to 10% of the incident energy can reach the surface

matter, lensing-galaxy cross-correlations can provide us important information
on the relation between dark matter and galaxy distributions, i.e., the bias.
In this paper, we propose a method to measure the stochasticity/nonlinearity of
the galaxy bias through correlation studies of the cosmic shear and galaxy
number fluctuations. Specifically, we employ the aperture mass statistics
$M_{ap}$ to describe the cosmic shear. We divide the foreground galaxy redshift
$z_f<z_s$ into several bins, where $z_s$ is the redshift of the source
galaxies, and calculate the quantity $<M_{ap}N_g(z_f)>^2/< N_g^2(z_f)>$ for
each redshift bin. Then the ratio of the summation of $<M_{ap}N_g(z_f)>^2/<
N_g^2(z_f)>$ over the bins to $<M_{ap}^2>$ gives a measure of the
nonlinear/stochastic bias. Here $N_g(z_f)$ is the projected surface number
density fluctuation of foreground galaxies at redshift $z_f$, and $M_{ap}$ is
the aperture mass from the cosmic-shear analysis. We estimate that for a
moderately deep weak-lensing survey with $z_s=1$, source galaxy surface number
density $n_b=30 \hbox {gal}/\hbox {arcmin}^2$ and a survey area of $25 \hbox
{deg}^2$, the effective $r$-parameter that represents the deviation from the
linear and deterministic bias is detectable in the angular range of 1'-10' if
$|r-1|\gsim 10%$. For shallow, wide surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey with $z_s=0.5$, $n_b=5 \hbox {gal}/\hbox {arcmin}^2$, and a survey area

agreement with predictions from a theoretical model constructed using the
Astrophysical Plasma Emission Code (APEC). The model uses an emission measure
distribution derived from FeXV to FeXXIV lines. While these 18 emission lines
cannot be isolated in the LETGS or RGS spectra, their wavelengths and fluxes as
measured with HEG are consistent with the lower resolution spectra. In the
Capella model for HEG, the weak intercombination line of NeIX is significantly
blended by iron lines, which contribute about half the flux. After accounting
for blending in the He-like diagnostic lines, we find the density to be
consistent with the low density limit (n_e<2 10^10 cm^-3); however, the
electron temperature indicated by the NeIX G-ratio is surprisingly low (~2MK)

that the NeIX triplet is less blended in cooler plasmas and in plasmas with an

their counts, such that low concentration (disk-like) galaxies decline. We
relate the morphological and colour information for our EROs and conclude that
those EROs morphologically classified as bulges do indeed possess SEDs

SEDs are mostly associated with disk-like and peculiar galaxies. However, ~30%
of disk EROs reside in the passive region of I/J/K colour-colour space. These
could be either genuinely passive systems, lower redshift contaminants to the

density is almost constant against the radius in 2A 0335+096; there is no
evidence of excess absorption up to 200--250 kpc. This indicates that no
significant amount of cold material, which has cooled down, is present. These
properties are similar to those of A 2199. Since the cooling time in the

radio jets associated with their cD galaxy. We discuss the possibility of
heating processes caused by these radio jets by considering the thermal
conduction and the sound velocity together with the observed disturbance of the
ICM temperature and density. We conclude that the observed radio jets can
produce local heating and/or cooling, but do not sufficiently reduce the
overall radiative cooling. This implies that much more violent jets, whose
emission has now decayed, heated up the cooling gas $>10^9$ years ago.

(B > 1.e13 G), a phase transition may occur in the outermost layers. As a
consequence the neutron star becomes `bare', i.e. no gaseous atmosphere sits on
the top of the crust. The surface of a cooling, bare neutron star does not
necessarily emit a blackbody spectrum because the emissivity is strongly
suppressed at energies below the electron plasma frequency, omega_p. Since
omega_p ~ 1 keV under the conditions typical of the denseelectron gas in the
condensate, the emission from a T ~ 100 eV bare neutron star will be
substantially depressed with respect to that of a perfect Planckian radiator at
most energies. Here we present a detailed analysis of the emission properties
of a bare neutron star. In particular, we derive the surface emissivity for a
Fe composition in a range of magnetic fields and temperatures representative of
cooling isolated neutron stars, like RX J1856.5-3754. We find that the emitted
spectrum is strongly dependent on the electron conductivity in the solid
surface layers. In the cold electron gas approximation (no electron-lattice
interactions), the spectrum turns out to be a featureless depressed blackbody
in the 0.1-2 keV band with a steeper low-energy distribution. When damping
effects due to collisions between electrons and the ion lattice (mainly due to
electron-phonon interactions) are accounted for, the spectrum is more depressed
depending on the magnetic field strength. Details of the emitted spectrum are
found, however, to be strongly dependent of the assumed treatment of the
transition from the external vacuum to the metallic surface. The implications
of out results to RX J1856.5-3754 and other isolated neutron stars are

between the two peaks, at the same time as the integrated flux in the broad

an asymmetric accretion disk around a supermassive black hole, whose source of
ionization is getting dimmer, causing the region of maximum emission to come
closer to the center (and thus to regions of higher projected velocity). We use
the observations to constrain the evolution of the accretion disk emission and
to evaluate two models: the elliptical disk model previously found to reproduce
the observations from 1991 to 1996 and a model of a circular disk with a single
spiral arm. We favor the latter, because the whole set of data is consistent
with a monotonic precession of the spiral pattern, which has completed almost
two revolutions since 1991. The precession period implies a black hole mass of
approximately 5x10^7 solar masses. Finally, we have found tentative evidence of
the emergence of an accretion disk wind, which we hope to explore further with

phase, density and superfluid velocities, and find that the zero-point

loss of long range phase correlations, growing logarithmically with distance,
and hence lead to a fragmented state at zero temperature. The vortex positional
ordering is preserved at zero temperature, but the thermally excited Tkachenko
modes cause the relative positional fluctuations to grow logarithmically with

condensation, and describe likelihood and lifespan of the different metastable
states. The simulation are performed with a bead-stiff spring model with
excluded volume interaction and exponentially decaying attractive potential.
The semiflexible chain collapse is studied as functions of the three relevant
length scales of the phenomenon, i.e., the total chain length $L$, the
persistence length $L_p$ and the condensation length $L_0 = \sqrt{k_B T
L_p/u_0}$, where $u_0$ is a measure of the attractive potential per unit
length. Two dimensionless ratios, $L/L_p$ and $L_0/L_p$, suffice to describe
the decay rate of uncollapsed states, which appears to scale as $(L/L_p)^{1/3}
(L_0/L_p)$. The condensation sequence is described in terms of the time series
of the well separated energy levels associated with each metastable collapsed
state. The collapsed states are described quantitatively through the spatial
correlation of tangent vectors along the chain. We also compare the results
obtained with a locally inextensible bead-rod chain and with a phantom
bead-spring model. Finally, we show preliminary results on the effects of
steady shear flow on the kinetics of collapse.

the new product if she has formed her individual valuation of the product

the product announced by the firm in a given period. Our model differs from
previous percolation-based models of new-product diffusion in two respects.
First, we consider macroscopic feedback effects affecting the supply or the
demand side of the market (or both). Second, a consumer who did not buy the
product in the period in which her valuation was formed remains a potential
buyer and buys in some later period if and when her individual valuation equals
or exceeds the price of the product. Unlike most previous models of new-product
diffusion, our framework accounts for the empirical finding of long tails
characteristic for early stages of innovation diffusion.

falsification, pre-dating, or post-dating by interested parties, even by the

untrustworthy and susceptible to suppression or manipulation by interested

These have been first introduced by Baader and Sattler as ALCN(M) languages,
with the adoption of role constructors M subset-of {o,-,And,Or}. In particular,
they showed in 1999 that, although ALCN(o) is decidable, the addition of other
operators may easily lead to undecidability: in fact, ALCN(o,And) and
ALCN(o,-,Or) were proved undecidable.
  In this work, we further investigate the computational properties of the ALCN
family, aiming at narrowing the decidability gap left open by Baader and
Sattler's results. In particular, we will show that ALCN(o) extended with
inverse roles both in number and in value restrictions becomes undecidable,
whereas it can be safely extended with qualified number restrictions without
losing decidability.

functions. The simple and exact equations that determine these flows are
obtained when $n$ is an integer. In particular, it is proved that there is no

found to begin with zero energy density and in the course of evolution the

out some special models for the structure of the states of SU(2) and SU(3)

the entropy of the singlet states monotonically decreases meaning that the
mixing of these states continually diminishes with the temperature. It has been
found that the structure of the octet states is more complex so that it can be
best characterized by two parts. One part is very similar to that of the

between two of the three color states. Furthermore, we work out the entropy for
the {\it classical} Ising and the {\it quantum} XY spin chains. In Ising model
the quantum (ground state) entropy does not directly enter into the canonical
partition function. It also does not depend on the number of spatial
dimensions, but only on the number of quantum states making up the ground
state. Whereas, the XY spin chain has a finite entropy at vanishing
temperature. The results from the spin models qualitatively analogous to our
models for the states of SU(2) and SU(3).

prediction of gauge theory anomalous dimensions to all orders in the `t Hooft

is feasible, using a recently discovered relation to integrable (super) spin
chains, provided one considers the lowest order in lambda. This one-loop

noninvasive feedback control scheme aimed at stabilizing traveling wave
solutions of the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg Landau equation (CGLE) in the
Benjamin-Feir unstable regime. The feedback control is a generalization of the
time-delay method of Pyragas, which was proposed by Lu, Yu and Harrison in the
setting of nonlinear optics. It involves both spatial shifts, by the wavelength
of the targeted traveling wave, and a time delay that coincides with the
temporal period of the traveling wave. We derive a single necessary and
sufficient stability criterion which determines whether a traveling wave is
stable to all perturbation wavenumbers. This criterion has the benefit that it
determines an optimal value for the time-delay feedback parameter. For various
coefficients in the CGLE we use this algebraic stability criterion to
numerically determine stable regions in the (K,rho) parameter plane, where rho
is the feedback parameter associated with the spatial translation and K is the
wavenumber of the traveling wave. We find that the combination of the two
feedbacks greatly enlarges the parameter regime where stabilization is
possible, and that the stability regions take the form of stability tongues in
the (K,rho)--plane. We discuss possible resonance mechanisms that could account
for the spacing with K of the stability tongues.

with the collective dephasing channel or collective rotating channel.
  In these protocols, Bob only takes passive photon detection to measure the
polarization qubits in the random bases. The source for the protocol with
collective rotating channel is made by type 2 spontaneous parametric down
conversion with random unitary rotation and phase shifter, no quantum
disentangler is required.
  A simple proof for unconditionally security is shown.

in the preceding paper ``Structure of multiphoton quantum optics. I. Canonical
formalism and homodyne squeezed states'', we introduce two-mode nonlinear
canonical transformations depending on two heterodyne mixing angles. They are
defined in terms of hermitian nonlinear functions that realize heterodyne
superpositions of conjugate quadratures of bipartite systems. The canonical
transformations diagonalize a class of Hamiltonians describing non degenerate
and degenerate multiphoton processes. We determine the coherent states
associated to the canonical transformations, which generalize the non
degenerate two--photon squeezed states. Such heterodyne multiphoton squeezed
are defined as the simultaneous eigenstates of the transformed, coupled
annihilation operators. They are generated by nonlinear unitary evolutions
acting on two-mode squeezed states. They are non Gaussian, highly non
classical, entangled states. For a quadratic nonlinearity the heterodyne
multiphoton squeezed states define two--mode cubic phase states. The
statistical properties of these states can be widely adjusted by tuning the
heterodyne mixing angles, the phases of the nonlinear couplings, as well as the
strength of the nonlinearity. For quadratic nonlinearity, we study the
higher-order contributions to the susceptibility in nonlinear media and we
suggest possible experimental realizations of multiphoton conversion processes
generating the cubic-phase heterodyne squeezed states.

  Phys. A","J. Phys. A 38, L7 (2005).","10.1088/0305-4470/38/1/L02",,"quant-ph",,"  It is commonly believed that photon polarisation entanglement can only be
obtained via pair creation within the same source or via postselective
measurements on photons that overlapped within their coherence time inside a
linear optics setup. In contrast to this, we show here that polarisation
entanglement can also be produced by distant single photon sources in free
space and without the photons ever having to meet, if the detection of a photon
does not reveal its origin -- the which way information. In the case of two
sources, the entanglement arises under the condition of two emissions in
certain spatial directions and leaves the dipoles in a maximally entangled
state.

out in quantum field theory in which the Heisenberg picture and Schrodinger

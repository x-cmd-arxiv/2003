synchrotron emission from shock accelerated TeV electrons. The existence of
these TeV electrons strongly suggests that the shocks in SNRs are sources of
galactic cosmic rays (CRs). In addition, there is convincing evidence from
broad-band studies of individual SNRs and elsewhere that the particle
acceleration process in SNRs can be efficient and nonlinear. If SNR shocks are
efficient particle accelerators, the production of CRs impacts the thermal
properties of the shock heated, X-ray emitting gas and the SNR evolution. We
report on a technique that couples nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration,
including the backreaction of the accelerated particles on the structure of the
forward and reverse shocks, with a hydrodynamic simulation of SNR evolution.
Compared to models which ignore CRs, the most important hydrodynamical effects
of placing a significant fraction of shock energy into CRs are larger shock
compression ratios and lower temperatures in the shocked gas. We compare our
results, which use an approximate description of the acceleration process, with
a more complete model where the full CR transport equations are solved (i.e.,
Berezhko et al., 2002), and find excellent agreement for the CR spectrum summed
over the SNR lifetime and the evolving shock compression ratio. The importance
of the coupling between particle acceleration and SNR dynamics for the
interpretation of broad-band continuum and thermal X-ray observations is
discussed.

The behavior of the correlation function under parity transformation is
obtained and found to agree with previous results. We find that in contrast to
the two-point shear correlation function, the three-point function at a given
angular scale \theta is not affected by power in the bispectrum on much larger
scales. These relations are then inverted to obtain the bispectrum in terms of
the three-point shear correlator; two different expressions, corresponding to
different natural components of the shear correlator, are obtained and can be
used to separate E and B-mode shear contributions. These relations allow us to
explicitly show that correlations containing an odd power of B-mode shear
vanish for parity-symmetric fields. Generalizing a recent result by Jarvis et
al., we derive expressions for the third-order aperture measures, employing
multiple angular scales, in terms of the (natural components of the)
three-point shear correlator and show that they contain essentially all the
information about the underlying bispectrum. We discuss the many useful
features these (generalized) aperture measures have that makes them convenient
for future analyses of the skewness of the cosmic shear field (and any other
polar field, such as the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background).

spectra as well as published and archived radio and X-ray maps to constrain the
origin and source of ionization of these filaments. A broad range of phenomena
is observed, including large-scale ionization cones and galactic winds, tidal
interaction, and ram-pressure stripping by an intracluster medium. The source
of ionization in this gas ranges from shock ionization to photoionization by
the central AGN or in-situ hot young stars. The sample is too small to draw
statistically meaningful conclusions about the extent and properties of the
warm ionized medium on large scale and its relevance to galaxy formation and
evolution. The next generation of tunable filters on large telescopes promises
to improve the sensitivity to faint emission-line fluxes at least tenfold and
allow systematic surveys of a large sample of emission-line galaxies.

power laws absorbed by gas and dust with a column density equal to or higher
than that toward the Galactic Center (6 times 10^{22} cm^{-2}). Four of these
sources also exhibit emission lines near 6.7 keV from He-like Fe, with

Rm_c tends to a very large constant value inaccessible at current resolutions.

can exist at scales smaller than the flow scale, i.e., it is always effectively
a large-Pr dynamo. If there is a finite Rm_c, our results provide a lower

stars results in a highly concentrated, massive (globular cluster-like) stellar
system. We show that under very general conditions a large-scale gravitational
instability in the ISM, which triggers the collapse of a massive cloud, leads
with the aid of a spontaneous first generation of massive stars, to a standing,
small-radius, cold and dense shell. Eventually, as more of the collapsing
matter is processed and incorporated, the shell becomes gravitationally
unstable and begins to fragment, allowing the formation of new stars, while
keeping its location. This is due to a detailed balance established between the
ram pressure from the collapsing cloud which, together with the gravitational
force exerted on the shell by the forming cluster, acts against the mechanical
energy deposited by the collection of new stars. We analyze the mass spectrum
of fragments that result from the continuous fragmentation of the standing
shell and show that its shape is well approximated at the high mass end by a
power law with slope -2.25, very close to the value that fits the universal
IMF. The self-contamination resultant from the continuous generation of stars
is shown to lead to a large metal spread in massive ($\sim$ 10$^6$ M$_\odot$)
clusters, while clusters with a mass similar to 10$^5$ M$_\odot$ or smaller,
simply reflect the initial metalicity of the collapsing cloud. This is in good
agreement with the data available for globular clusters in the Galaxy.

suggest that the gravity propagation speed can be different from the light

fractional charge exchanged between the dot and each lead through a single
resonance point is related to the relative couplings of the dot and the leads
at this resonance. If each resonance point along the pumping contour is
dominated by the coupling to a single lead (which also implies a very small
transmission), then the crossing of each such resonance results in a single
electron exchange between the dot and that lead, ending up with a net quantized
charge. When the resonance approximation is valid, the fractional charges can
also be extracted from the peaks of the transmissions between the various

is explained by the relation $1/T_1\propto T\cdot\chi_Q(T)^{3/4}$ based on the
anisotropic spin-fluctuations model in case of the proximity to an
antiferromagnetic (AFM) quantum critical point (QCP). The novel behavior of
$1/T_1\sim T^{1/4}$ over a wide $T$ range of $T_{\rm c} < T < 40$ K arises
because the staggered susceptibility almost follows the Curie law
$\chi_Q(T)\propto 1/(T+\theta)$ with $\theta= 0.6$ K and hence $1/T_1\propto
T/(T+0.6)^{3/4}\sim T^{1/4}$ for $\theta < T$. We highlight that the behavior
$1/T_1\sim T^{1/4}$ is due to the proximity to the anisotropic AFM QCP relevant
with its layered structure, and is not associated with the AFM QCP for
isotropic 3D systems. We have also found that the AFM spin fluctuations in
CeCoIn$_5$ are suppressed by small magnetic field so that $\theta=0.6$ K at

the meson structures and the baryon excitations to resonances, in particular

resonances. Presumed quark structures of the mesons eta(548), omega(772),

mesons are enough small for a using of perturbative methods. The following
topics are briefly considered and discussed: harmonic quark series and its
boundaries, the d-quark peculiarity, parallel quark series and quark mixing.
The boundaries of quark chain can are closely related to a weak interaction.
The cause of the quark mixing is probably an existence of the parallel quark
chain and the special properties of the d-quark in the main quark chain. The
new mass equation is found. It is probably a manifestation of Higgs mechanism.
Using this equality enables to improve the accuracy of the harmonic quark

invariant I_F, which roughly takes the form of a product of a power series
counting perturbed pseudo-holomorphic tori, and the Reidemeister torsion of the
symplectic Floer complex. We pointed out the formal resemblance of I_F with a
generating function of genus 1 Gromov invariant; furthermore, for heuristic
reasons one also expects a relation with the 1-loop generating function in the
A-model side of mirror symmetry, which counts genus 1 holomorphic curves.
  The present article makes this expected relation precise in the simplest
cases, in two variants of the I_F defined in the earlier work: the lagrangian
intersection version, I_F(L, L'), and an S^1-equivariant version, I_F^{S^1}.
  As a by-product, we obtain some existence results of noncontractible periodic
orbits in symplectic dynamics. For example, the results of Gatien-Lalonde are
extended to a much wider class of manifolds.
  The two versions I_F(L, L') and I_F^{S^1} are only minimally developed in

do exist. A vortex soliton occurs robust with respect to symmetry-breaking
modulational instability in the self-defocusing regime provided that its radial
profile becomes flattened, so that a self-trapped wave beam gets a pronounced
surface. It is demonstrated that the dynamics of a slightly perturbed stable
vortex soliton resembles an oscillation of a liquid stream having a surface
tension. Using the idea of sustaining effective surface tension for spatial
vortex soliton in a media with competing nonlinearities the explanation of a
suppression of the modulational instability is proposed.

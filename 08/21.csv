These data were taken with the aim of testing the idea that this object
contains a quasar nucleus that is moderately extinguished, despite evidence
that its radio jet points close to our line-of-sight. We detect broad Paschen
Alpha emission (FWHM ~1745 km/s), relatively bright continuum emission, and a
continuum slope consistent with a reddened quasar spectrum (3.1 < Av < 7.3),
all emitted by an unresolved point source. Therefore we conclude that we have,
indeed, detected a hidden quasar nucleus in PKS1549-79. Combined with previous
results, these observations are consistent with the idea that PKS1549-79 is a
young radio source in which the cocoon of debric left over from the triggering
events has not yet been swept aside by circumnuclear outflows.

Although progress has been made in understanding the relevant processes

idea that winds would be driven away by centrifugal forces, with large

theoretical work is converging on a picture that closely resembles the latest
HST and CHANDRA images, providing hope for the future. No less than 3 groups
have recently confirmed the early Krause-Polstorff-Michel simulations showing
that the fundamental plasma distribution around a rotating neutron star
consists of two polar domes and an equatorial torus of trapped nonneutral
plasma of opposite sign charges. Unless a lot of new physics can be added, this

shearing box simulations of protoplanets interacting with a disc undergoing MHD
turbulence with zero net flux magnetic fields. We investigate the nature of the
disc response and conditions for gap formation. This issue is an important one
for determining the type and nature of the migration of the protoplanet, with
the presence of a deep gap being believed to enable slower migration. For both
types of simulation we find a common pattern of behaviour for which the main
parameter determining the nature of the response is $M_p R^3/(M_* H^3)$, with
$M_p$, $M_*$, $R$, and $H$ being the protoplanet mass, the central mass, the
orbital radius and the disc semi-thickness respectively. We find that as this
parameter is increased towards 0.1, the presence of the protoplanet is first
indicated by the appearance of the well known trailing wake which, although it
may appear erratic on account of the turbulence, appears to be well defined.
Once the above parameter exceeds a number around unity a gap starts to develop
inside which the magnetic energy density tends to be concentrated in the high
density wakes. This gap formation condition can be understood from simple
dimensional considerations of the conditions for nonlinearity, and the balance
of angular momentum transport due to Maxwell and Reynolds' stresses with that
due to tidal torques. An important result is that the basic flow morphology in
the vicinity of the protoplanet is very similar in both the local and global
simulations. This indicates that local shearing box simulations, which are
computationally less demanding, capture much of the physics of disc-planet
interaction. Thus they may provide a useful tool for studying the local
interaction between forming protoplanets and turbulent, protostellar discs.

that a balance between conduction and cooling can exist in the hotter clusters
(T > 5 keV), provided the plasma conductivity is close to the unhindered
Spitzer value. In the absence of any additional heat sources, a reduced mass
inflow must develop in the cooler objects in the sample. We fit cooling flow
models to deprojected data and compare the spectral mass deposition rates found
to the values required to account for the excess luminosity, assuming
Spitzer-rate heat transfer over the observed temperature gradients. The mass
inflow rates found are lower than is necessary to maintain energy balance in at
least five clusters. However, emission from cooling gas may be partially
absorbed. We also compute the flux supplied by turbulent heat transport (Cho et
al. 2003) and find conductivity profiles which follow a strikingly similar
temperature dependence to the conductivity values required to prevent cooling.
Finally, we show that the cluster radio luminosities vary by over five orders
of magnitude in objects with X-ray luminosities differing by no more than a
factor of a few. This suggests that there is unlikely to be a straightforward
correlation between the mechanical power provided by the radio lobes and the

erg/sec/cm^2, as well as a gap in the burst oscillations, similar to that seen
in Eddington limited bursts from other sources. Assuming this burst was
Eddington limited we obtain a source distance of about 8 kpc. All the bursts
show coherent oscillations at the 314.4 Hz spin frequency. The burst
oscillations are strongly frequency and phase locked to the persistent

seconds following burst onset. In both cases the initial drift corresponds to a
spin down of a few tenths of a Hz. The large oscillation amplitude during the

detect, for the first time, a significant first harmonic component in burst
oscillations. The ratio of countrate in the first harmonic to that in the
fundamental can be > 0.25 and is, on average, less than that of the persistent
pulsations. If the pulsations result from a single bright region on the
surface, the harmonic strength suggests the burst emission is beamed, perhaps
due to a stronger magnetic field than in non-pulsing LMXBs. Alternatively, the
harmonic content could result from a geometry with two bright regions.

the disc on the embedded planets as a function of planet mass, and thus make a
first study of orbital migration of planets due to interaction with turbulent
discs. Global simulations were performed for a disc with H/R=0.07 and planet
masses M_p=3,10,30 Earth masses, and 3 Jupiter masses. Shearing box runs were
performed for values of (M_p/M_*)/(H/R)^3=0.1,0.3,1.0 and 2.0, M_* being the
central mass. These allow embedded and gap forming planets to be examined. In
all cases the instantaneous torque exerted on a planet showed strong
fluctuations. In the embedded cases it oscillated between negative and positive
values, and migration occurs as a random walk, unlike the usual type I
migration. Running time averages for embedded planets over 20-25 orbital
periods show that large fluctuations occur on longer time scales, preventing
convergence of the average torque to well defined values, or even to a well
defined sign. Fluctuations become relatively smaller for larger masses, giving
better convergence, due to the planet's perturbation of the disc becoming
larger than the turbulence in its vicinity. Eventually gap formation occurs,
with a transition to type II migration. The existence of significant
fluctuations occurring in turbulent discs on long time scales is important for
lower mass embedded protoplanets. If significant fluctuations occur on the
longest disc evolutionary time scales, convergence of torque running averages
for practical purposes will not occur, and the migration behaviour of low mass
protoplanets considered as an ensemble would be very different from predictions
of type I theory for laminar discs.

braking for late type stars taking into account recent observational data on

on an idealized two component coronal model subject to constraints imposed on
the variation of the coronal gas density with rotation period inferred from the
observed variation of X-ray luminosity, L_x, with rotation rate, Omega, (L_x
\propto Omega^2) for single rotating dwarfs. An application of the model to
high rotation rates leads to a gradual turnover of the X-ray luminosity which
is similar to the saturation recently observed in rapidly rotating dwarfs. The
resulting angular momentum loss rate, \dot J, depends on Omega in the form \dot
J \propto Omega^beta where beta ~ 3 for slow rotators and ~ 1.3 for fast
rotators. The relation at high rotation rates significantly differs from the
power law exponent for slowly rotating stars, depressing the angular momentum
loss rate without necessarily requiring the saturation of the magnetic field.
The application of this model to the evolution of cataclysmic variable binary
systems leads to mass transfer rates that are in approximate accord with those
observed in comparison to rates based on either a Skumanich law or an empirical

detectable total eclipses of depth 0.08 mag for the primary eclipse and 0.011
mag for the secondary eclipse (in I only). We confirm the detection of a third
star in spectra contributing 11.5% +/- 1.5% of the total light in V band. The
radial velocity of the third star indicates that it is a cluster member, but it
is unclear whether it is physically associated with the eclipsing binary. Using
spectroscopic and photometric data, we deconvolve the photometry of the three
stars, and find that the primary star in the eclipsing binary is significantly
hotter than the turnoff. The two most likely explanations are that the primary
star is in a rapid phase of evolution near core hydrogen exhaustion (associated
with the turnoff gap in M67's color-magnitude diagram), or that it is a blue
straggler created during a stellar collision earlier in the cluster's history.
Our detection of Li in the primary star tightly constrains possible formation
mechanisms in the blue straggler explanation. Because S986 is often used to
constrain tidal dissipation models, this may imply that the strength of tidal
effects is underestimated.

observation. A 21.9 +- 0.6 mJy radio flare was detected at 1026.75 MHz two days
before the X-ray maximum; the radio source was also detected late in the
outburst, after the X-ray source entered the low hard state. The X-ray light
curve exhibits the classic shape of a rapid rise and an exponential decay. The
spectrum is soft and dominated by emission from the accretion disk. The
continuum is fit with a multicolor disk blackbody (kT_{max} = 1.04 keV) and a
power-law (Gamma ~ 2.7). Midway through the decay phase, a strong low-frequency
QPO (nu = 7.3-8.1 Hz) was present for several days. The spectra feature a broad
Fe K alpha line that is asymmetric, suggesting that the line is due to
relativistic broadening rather than Comptonization. Relativistic Laor models
provide much better fits to the line than non-relativistic Gaussian models,
particularly near the beginning and end of our observations. The line fits
yield estimates for the inner disk radius that are within 6 R_g; this result
and additional evidence indicates that this black hole may have a non-zero

of IR excess obtained with the ISO satellite and discussed the ages of stars
with excess. The amount of dust (measured by the luminosity fraction
\fdust=L_\mathrm{IR}/L_{\star}) seen around main-sequence stars of different
ages shows several interesting trends. To discuss these results in the context
of a physical model, we develop in this paper an analytical model for the dust
production in Vega-type systems. Previously it has been claimed that a powerlaw
slope of about -2 in the diagram plotting amount of dust versus time could be
explained by a simple collisional cascade. We show that such a cascade in fact
results in a powerlaw \fdust\propto t^{-1} if the dust removal processes are
dominated by collisions. A powerlaw \fdust\propto t^{-2} only results when the
dust removal processes become dominated by Pointing-Robertson drag. This may be
the case in the Kuiper Belt of our own solar system, but it is certainly not
the case in any of the observed disks. A steeper slope can, however, be created
by including continuous stirring into the models. We show that the existence of
both young and old Vega-like systems with large amounts of dust (\fdust\simeq
10^{-3}) can be explained qualitatively by Kuiper-Belt-like structures with
\emph{delayed stirring}. Finally, the absence of young stars with intermediate
amounts of dust may be due to the fact that stirring due to planet formation
may not be active in young low-mass disks. The considerations in this paper
support the picture of simultaneous stirring and dust production proposed by
Kenyon and Bromley (2002).

and, in a tighter way, on observed K-band luminosity. We find that L_dust/L_FUV
is proportional to e^(-tau_K) (alpha+0.62) (L_K)^(0.62), where L_FUV and L_K
are the unattenuated stellar luminosities in far-UV and K, respectively, and
alpha is the ratio of the attenuation optical depths at 0.165 micron (tau_FUV)

morphology. It may be further expressed as L_dust/L_FUV proportional to
(L_K)^delta, where delta = 0.61 - 0.02 alpha, under the
observationally-motivated assumption that, for an average inclination,
e^(-tau_K) is proportional to (L_K)^(-0.02). We adopt calculations of two
different models of attenuation of stellar light by internal dust to derive
solid-angle averaged values of alpha. We find that delta is positive and
decreases towards 0 from the more luminous to the less luminous galaxies. This
means that there is no universal ratio of far-IR luminosity to unattenuated
far-UV luminosity for nearby, normal late-type galaxies. (Abridged)

shows that the present theory can be extended from the astrophysical to the

process. This transition is connected to the relevant presence of the
electromagnetic and nuclear interactions inside the matter. In this sense, the
presented rule is correct from a subatomic scale to an astrophysical one. We
discuss the near full agreement at organic cell scale and human scale too.
Consequently the Universe, with its structures at all scales (atomic nucleus,
organic cell, human, planet, solar system, galaxy, clusters of galaxy, super
clusters of galaxy), could have a fundamental quantum reason. In conclusion, we
analyze the spatial dimensions of the objects in the Universe as well as
spacetime dimensions. The result is that it seems we live in an El Naschie's E

amplitude $t_{QD}=-i|t_{QD}|e^{i\alpha_{QD}}$ through a quantum dot (QD), as
function of the plunger gate voltage $V$. Mesoscopic solid state Aharonov-Bohm
interferometers (ABI) have been used to measure the ""intrinsic"" phase,
$\alpha_{QD}$, when the QD is placed on one of the paths. In a ""closed""
interferometer, connected to two terminals, the electron current is conserved,
and Onsager's relations require that the conductance ${\cal G}$ through the ABI
is an even function of the magnetic flux $\Phi=\hbar c\phi/e$ threading the ABI
ring. Therefore, if one fits ${\cal G}$ to $A+B\cos(\phi+\beta)$ then $\beta$
only ""jumps"" between 0 and $\pi$, with no relation to $\alpha_{QD}$. Additional
terminals open the ABI, break the Onsager relations and yield a non-trivial
variation of $\beta$ with $V$. After reviewing these topics, we use theoretical
models to derive three results on this problem: (i) For the one-dimensional
leads, the relation $|t_{QD}|^2 \propto \sin^2(\alpha_{QD})$ allows a direct
measurement of $\alpha_{QD}$. (ii) In many cases, the measured ${\cal G}$ in
the closed ABI can be used to extract {\it both} $|t_{QD}|$ and $\alpha_{QD}$.
(iii) For open ABI's, $\beta$ depends on the details of the opening. We present
quantitative criteria (which can be tested experimentally) for $\beta$ to be
equal to the desired $\alpha_{QD}$: the ""lossy"" channels near the QD should
have both a small transmission and a small reflection.

either inside the stripes or in the antiferromagnetic domains between the
stripes. The characteristic energy difference between these two kinds of states
is identified with the pseudogap. The superconducting (SC) order parameter
predicted by the model has two components, whose phases exhibit a complex
dependence on the the center-of-mass coordinate. The model predictions for the
tunneling characteristics and for the dependence of the critical temperature on
the superfluid density show good quantitative agreement with a number of
experiments. The model, in particular, predicts that the SC peaks in the
tunneling spectra are asymmetric, only when the ratio of the SC gap to the
critical temperature is greater than 4. It is also proposed that, at least in
some high-Tc cuprates, there exist two different superconducting states
corresponding to the same doping concentration and the same critical
temperature. Finally, the checkerboard pattern in the local density of states

  Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-03), (2003), Acapulco, Mexico, 434-439",,"NRC-46496","cs.LG cs.CL cs.IR",,"  Keyphrases are useful for a variety of purposes, including summarizing,
indexing, labeling, categorizing, clustering, highlighting, browsing, and
searching. The task of automatic keyphrase extraction is to select keyphrases
from within the text of a given document. Automatic keyphrase extraction makes
it feasible to generate keyphrases for the huge number of documents that do not
have manually assigned keyphrases. A limitation of previous keyphrase
extraction algorithms is that the selected keyphrases are occasionally
incoherent. That is, the majority of the output keyphrases may fit together
well, but there may be a minority that appear to be outliers, with no clear
semantic relation to the majority or to each other. This paper presents
enhancements to the Kea keyphrase extraction algorithm that are designed to
increase the coherence of the extracted keyphrases. The approach is to use the
degree of statistical association among candidate keyphrases as evidence that
they may be semantically related. The statistical association is measured using
web mining. Experiments demonstrate that the enhancements improve the quality
of the extracted keyphrases. Furthermore, the enhancements are not
domain-specific: the algorithm generalizes well when it is trained on one
domain (computer science documents) and tested on another (physics documents).

the quantum fluctuations and this can be understood as a consequence of the

matter aggregations, we find that the stability of the Godel model depends
primarily upon the presence of gradients in the centrifugal energy, and
secondarily on the equation of state of the fluid. The latter dictates the
behaviour of the model when dealing with homogeneous perturbations. The
vorticity of the perturbed Godel model is found to evolve as in almost-FRW
spacetimes, with some additional directional effects due to shape distortions.
We also consider gravitational-wave perturbations by investigating the
evolution of the magnetic Weyl component. This tensor obeys a simple plane-wave
equation, which argues for the neutral stability of the Godel model against
linear gravity-wave distortions. The implications of the background rotation
for scalar-field Godel cosmologies are also discussed.

on a particle of small mass $\mu$ orbiting a black hole of mass $M$, where
$\mu\ll M$. At first order in $\mu$, the geometry is perturbed and the motion
of the particle is affected by its self-force. The self-force, however,
diverges at the location of the particle, and hence should be regularized. It
is known that the properly regularized self-force is given by the tail part (or
the $R$-part) of the self-field, obtained by subtracting the direct part (or
the $S$-part) from the full self-field. The most successful method of
regularization proposed so far relies on the spherical harmonic decomposition
of the self-force, the so-called mode-sum regularization or mode decomposition
regularization. However, except for some special orbits, no systematic
analytical method for computing the regularized self-force has been given. In
this paper, utilizing a new decomposition of the retarded Green function in the
frequency domain, we formulate a systematic method for the computation of the
self-force. Our method relies on the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion but the
order of the expansion can be arbitrarily high. To demonstrate the essence of
our method, in this paper, we focus on a scalar charged particle on the
Schwarzschild background. The generalization to the gravitational case is
straightforward, except for some subtle issues related with the choice of gauge
(which exists irrespective of regularization methods).

criterion that, any patch of area which acts as a horizon for a suitably
defined accelerated observer, must have an entropy proportional to its area.
After providing a brief justification for this ansatz, several consequences are
derived: (i) In any static spacetime with a horizon and associated temperature
$\beta^{-1}$, this entropy satisfies the relation $S=(1/2)\beta E$ where $E$ is
the energy source for gravitational acceleration, obtained as an integral of
$(T_{ab}-(1/2)Tg_{ab})u^au^b$. (ii) With this ansatz of $S$, the minimization
of Einstein-Hilbert action is equivalent to minimizing the free energy $F$ with
$\beta F=\beta U-S$ where $U$ is the integral of $T_{ab}u^au^b$. We discuss the

hidden in the modified theory: the Schwarzschild metric is a solution;
gravitational waves possess two polarizations, each traveling at the velocity
of light; a conserved energy-momentum (pseudo-) tensor can be constructed. The
modification is visible in the intensity of gravitational radiation: the two
polarizations of a gravity wave carry intensities that are suppressed/enchanced

approach leads to well-defined perturbative correlation functions on the
imaginary time continuation of de Sitter space. When continued to real-time, a
path integral with a non-local action generates the time-ordered correlators.
Curiously, observables built out of local products of the fields show no sign

pd --> 3He eta, pi- 3H --> 3He eta and pd --> 3H pi+. Free parameters are
fitted to the available experimental data and an extrapolation below the eta

The existence of a virtual -- and not a quasi-bound -- state finds support in
the data. The K-matrix permits a discussion of eta-pi mixing. A mixing
parameter of 0.010(5), i.e. a mixing angle theta =0.6(3) degrees, is extracted
from a best fit to the very recent pd --> 3He pi0 reaction data.

superposed horizontal liquid layers bounded by two solid planes and subjected
to a horizontal temperature gradient.
  The liquids are supposed to be immiscible with a nondeformable interface.
  The forces acting on the system are buoyancy and interfacial tension. Four
different flow patterns and temperature profiles are found for the basic state.
A linear perturbative analysis with respect to two and three dimensional
perturbations reveals the existence of three kind of patterns. Depending on the
relative height of both liquids several situations are predicted: either wave
propagation from cold to the hot regions, or waves propagating in the opposite
direction or still stationary longitudinal rolls. The behavior of three
different pairs of liquids which have been used in experiments on bilayers
under vertical gradient by other authors have been examined. The instability
mechanisms are discussed and a qualitative interpretation of the different
behaviors exhibited by the system is provided. In some configurations it is
possible to find a codimension-two point created by the interaction of two Hopf
modes with different frequencies and wavenumbers. These results suggest to
consider two liquid layers as an interesting prototype for the study of
propagation and interaction of waves in the context of the B\'enard-Marangoni
problem.

  For a convex cost depending only on the moduli of controls (i.e. the lasers
intensities), we prove that there always exists a minimizer in resonance. This
permits to justify some strategies used in experimental physics. It is also
quite important because it permits to reduce remarkably the complexity of the
problem (and extend some of our previous results for $n=2$ and $n=3$): instead
of looking for minimizers on the sphere $S^{2n-1}\subset\C^n$ one is reduced to
look just for minimizers on the sphere $S^{n-1}\subset \R^n$. Moreover, for the
reduced problem, we investigate on the question of existence of strict abnormal
minimizer.

know. The non-Markovian noises caused by the non-uniform distribution of photon
density of states near the photonic bandgap are handled by a new approach in
which the Liouville operator expansion is utilized to linearize the generalized
optical Bloch equations. The fluorescence spectra are then directly solved by
the linearized Bloch equations in the frequency domain. We find that if the
atomic energy level is far from the bandgap, fluorescence spectra with Mollow's
triplets are observed. However, when the atomic energy level is near the
bandgap, the relative magnitude and the number of the fluorescence peaks are
found to be varied according to the wavelength offset.

challenge this belief, and demonstrate that the time $t_r$ for maximum return
probability is in general shorter. We find that $t_r$ depends on $lambda =
eps_evol/eps_prep$, being the ratio of the error in setting the parameters
(fields) for the time reversed evolution to the perturbation which is involved
in the preparation process. Our results should be observable in spin-echo
experiments where the dynamical irreversibility of quantum phases is measured.

and isotropic universe as a transform from Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) coordinates, the model that solves the Einstein Field equation for an
ideal fluid. Any well behaved transform is also a solution. The problem is
relating the coordinates of the transform to observables. In the present case
the objective is to find T,R on a stationary frame that has the R be a physical
observable for all distances. We do this by working backwards, assuming the
form of the metric that we desire, with some undetermined coefficients. These
coefficients are then related to the partial derivatives of the transform. The
transformed coordinates T,R are found by the integration of partial
differential equations in the FLRW variables. We show that dR has the same
units as the radial differential of the FLRW metric, which makes it observable.
We develop a criterion for how close the transformed T comes to an observable
time. Close to the space origin at the present time, T also becomes physical,
so that the stationary acceleration becomes Newtonian. We show that a galactic
point on a R,T plot starts close to the space origin at the beginning, moves
out to a physical distance and finite time where it can release light that will
be seen at the origin at the present time. Lastly, because the observable R has
a finite limit at a finite T for t = 0 where the galactic velocity approaches
the light speed, we see that the universe filled with an ideal fluid as seen on
clocks and rulers on the stationary frame has a finite extent like that of an
expanding empty universe, beyond which are no galaxies and no space.

ground-based B-band observations to investigate how the color dispersion
relates to global galaxy properties. The intenal color dispersion generally
correlates with transformations in galaxy morphology as a function of
wavelength, i.e., it quantifies the morphological K-correction. Mid-type spiral
galaxies exhibit the highest dispersion in their internal colors, which stems
from differences in the bulge, disk, and spiral-arm components. Irregulars and
late-type spirals show moderate internal color dispersion, which implies that
young stars generally dominate the colors. Ellipticals, lenticulars, and
early-type spirals generally have low or negligible internal color dispersion,
which indicates that the stars contributing to the UV-to-optical emission have
a very homogeneous distribution. We discuss the application of the internal
color dispersion to high-redshift galaxies in deep, Hubble Space Telescope
images. By simulating local galaxies at cosmological distances, many of the
galaxies have luminosities that are sufficiently bright at rest--frame optical
wavelengths to be detected within the limits of the currently deepest
near-infrared surveys even with no evolution. Under assumptions that the
luminosity and color evolution of the local galaxies conform with the measured
values of high-redshift objects, we show that galaxies' intrinsic internal

catalog are confined largely to the central region (R < 4 kpc). They show a
remarkable spatial and kinematic correlation with overdense HI filaments; the
geometry suggests that the formation of GMCs follows that of the filaments. The
GMCs exhibit a mass spectrum dN/dM ~ M^(-2.6 +/- 0.3), considerably steeper
than that found in the Milky Way and in the LMC. Combined with the total mass,
this steep function implies that the GMCs in M33 form with a characteristic
mass of 7 X 10^4 M_sun. More than 2/3 of the GMCs have associated HII regions,
implying that the GMCs have a short quiescent period. Our results suggest the

Previously I
showed how galaxy catalogs are used to attribute relative degrees of isolation
to those clouds found in HST/GHRS spectra. I find that there exist two distinct
populations corresponding to two distinct environments, variously characterized
as void (unshocked) and non-void (shocked). Void clouds have a steep equivalent
width distribution (i.e., many smaller absorbers) while non-void clouds have a
flat distribution. These environment-specific observations of LyA clouds show
that the predictions from N-body/hydro simulations are incorrect. Simulations
fail to predict the existence of significant numbers of detectable void clouds.
They incorrectly predict the characteristics of non-void clouds. Implicated in
this failure is the so-called fluctuating Gunn-Peterson Approximation (FGPA)
which envisions that LyA absorbers are formed in the large-scale structures of
coalescing matter. I recently modeled the void cloud population as sub-galactic
perturbations that have expanded in response to reionization. However, the
success in this modeling was contingent upon using the more massive isothermal
halo in place of the standard Navarro, Frenk & White. Here, I extend my
modeling to non-void LyA clouds using the same basic cloud model. Nonvoid
clouds were once unshocked, but when entering nonvoid space, they are shock
stripped. By analytically stripping model void clouds, a good fit of the model
CDS to observations is found if cloud velocities are ~100 km/s. Nonvoid clouds
show strong concentration around galaxies, suggesting that the compact HVC
population are members of this population.

old question of the location of the inner edge of accretion disk around black
hole. We recall the fundamental results obtained in the 1970's and 1980's by
Warsaw and Kyoto research groups that proved, in particular, that the inner
edge does not coincide with the location of the innermost stable Keplerian
circular orbit. We give some novel illustrations of this particular point and
of some other fundamental results obtained by Warsaw and Kyoto groups. To
investigate the flow dynamics of the inner edge of accretion disk, we carefully
solve the structure of the transonic flow and plot the effective potential
profile based on the angular-momentum distribution calculated numerically. We
show that the flow does not have a potential minimum for accretion rates, {\dot
M} > 10 L_E/c^2 (with L_E being the Eddington luminosity and
  $c$ being the speed of light). This property is realized even in relatively
small viscosity parameters
  (i.e., \alpha ~ 0.01), because of the effect of pressure gradient. In
conclusion, the argument based on the last circular orbit of a test particle
cannot give a correct inner boundary of the super-critical flow and the inner
edge should be determined in connection with radiation efficiency. The same
argument can apply to optically thin ADAF. The interpretation of the observed
QPO frequencies should be re-considered, since the assumption of Kepler
rotation velocity can grossly over- or underestimate the disk rotation
velocity, depending on the magnitude of viscosity.

charged particles can then be neglected, which makes it possible to write an
evolution equation for the magnetic field that can be solved using an implicit
scheme. This avoids the severe restriction on the stable timestep that would
otherwise arise at high resolution, or when the Hall effect is large. Numerical
tests show that the scheme can accurately model steady multi-fluid shock
structures both with and without sub-shocks. Although the emphasis is on shocks
in molecular clouds, a multi-dimensional version of this code could be applied
to any Astrophysical flow in which ambi-polar diffusion or the Hall effect, or
both play a significant role.

observations of 199 NVSS radio sources with NVSS flux densities S(1.4GHz) >
7.8mJy are presented, and compared with the EIS I-band imaging observations
which reach a depth of I~23; optical identifications are obtained for over
two-thirds of the ~150 confirmed radio sources within the EIS field. The radio
sources have a median linear size of 6 arcseconds, consistent with the trend
for lower flux density radio sources to be less extended. Other radio source
properties, such as the lobe flux density ratios, are consistent with those of
brighter radio source samples. From the optical information, 30-40% of the
sources are expected to lie at redshifts z >~ 1.5.
  One of the key goals of this survey is to accurately determine the high
redshift evolution of the radio luminosity function. These radio sources are at
the ideal flux density level to achieve this goal; at redshifts z~2 they have
luminosities which are around the break of the luminosity function and so
provide a much more accurate census of the radio source population at those
redshifts than the existing studies of extreme, high radio power sources. Other
survey goals include investigating the dual--population unification schemes for
radio sources, studying the radio luminosity dependence of the evolution of
radio source environments, and understanding the radio power dependence of the
K-z relation for radio galaxies.

macroscopic description. Therefore, its experimental determination, especially
from small-angle-neutron-scattering experiments on isotopic blends, is of prime
importance in thermodynamic investigations. Experimentally extracted quantity,
commonly known as the effective chi is affected by thermodynamics, in
particular by polymer connectivity, and density and composition fluctuations.
The present work is primarily concerned with studying four possible effective
chi's, one of which is closely related to the conventionally defined effective
chi, to see which one plays the role of a reliable estimator of the bare chi.
We show that the conventionally extracted effective chi is not a good measure
of the bare chi in most blends. A related quantity that does not contain any
density fluctuations, and one which can be easily extracted, is a good
estimator of the bare chi in all blends except weakly interacting asymmetric
blends (see text for definition). The density fluctuation contribution is given
by (Delta v^bar)**2/2TK_T, where Delta v^bar is the difference of the partial
monomer volumes and K_T is the compressibility. Our effective chi's are
theory-independent. From our calculations and by explicitly treating
experimental data, we show that the effective chi's, as defined here, have weak
composition dependence and do not diverge in the composition wings. We
elucidate the impact of compressibility and interactions on the behavior of the
effective chi's and their relationship with the bare chi.

fluctuation contributions, where is the number of fluctuating extensive
quantities in the ensemble. We prove four general theorems and a corollary for
statistical fluctuations valid for any thermodynamic system. We also
demonstrate by two examples that the results of the theory remain valid

paradoxes, it is postulated that stationary metastable states like the ideal
glass cannot exist in Nature. We also prove a generalized Nernst theorem valid

vanishes. The theorem is no longer restricted to absolute temperature. We
calculate statistical fluctuations in the number of monomers and other physical

density and composition fluctuations are in general not statistically
independent, which is contrary to some recent claims. The standard isothermal
compressibility at constant monomer numbers does not represent the density
fluctuation in all ensembles. We show that the density fluctuation at constant
composition is a meaningless concept, except at absolute zero. We prove a

fluctuation in a multi-component system, which is an extension of a well-known

of this method, in general is not uniquely solvable for some $r>0$, contrary to
the implicit assumption of the NS method. If this equation is not uniquely

manifold with fixed topological type, we consider the set of all families of CY
manifolds of the fixed topological type over $C$ with degenerate fibres over
the fixed points up to isomorphism. This set is called Shafarevich set. The
analogue of Shafarevich conjecture for CY manifolds is for which topological
types of CY the Shafarevich set is finite. It is well-known that the analogue
of Shafarevich conjecture is closely related to the study of the moduli space
of polarized CY manifolds and the moduli space of the maps of fixed Riemann
surface to the coarse moduli space of the CY manifolds. We prove the existence
of the Teichm\""{u}ller space of CY manifolds together with a universal family
of marked CY manifolds. From this result we derive the existence of a finite
cover of the coarse moduli space which is a non-singular quasi-projective
manifold. Over this cover we construct a family of polarized CY manifolds. We
study the moduli space of maps of the fixed Riemann with fixed points on it to
the moduli space of CY manifolds constructed in the paper such that the maps
map the fixed points on the Riemann surface to the discriminant locus. If this

are some remaining patches of white. MKC fill in these patches, but only at the
price of introducing patches where the colouring becomes ''pathologically''
discontinuous. The discontinuities mean that the colours in these patches are
empirically unknowable. We prove a general theorem which shows that their
extent is at least as great as the patches of white in a conventional approach.
The theorem applies, not only to the MKC colourings, but also to any other such
attempt to circumvent the Bell-KS theorem (Pitowsky's colourings, for example).

of the most energetic events in the universe, means that black holes are key
objects for fundamental physics and astrophysics. Until recently, it was
generally believed that black holes in nature appear in two broad mass ranges:
stellar-mass (roughly 3-20 solar masses), which are produced by the core
collapse of massive stars, and supermassive (millions to billions of solar
masses), which are found in the centers of galaxies and are produced by a still
uncertain combination of processes. In the last few years, however, evidence
has accumulated for an intermediate-mass class of black holes, with hundreds to
thousands of solar masses. If such objects exist they have important
implications for the dynamics of stellar clusters, the formation of
supermassive black holes, and the production and detection of gravitational
waves. We review the evidence for intermediate-mass black holes and discuss
future observational and theoretical work that will help clarify numerous
outstanding questions about these objects.

galaxies with a velocity width of 200 km/s in the central 32 square degree

sensitivity. The HI data are complemented by very deep optical observations
from digital stacking of multi-exposure UK Schmidt Telescope R-band films,
which reach an isophotal level of 26.5 R mag arcsec^-2 (~27.5 B mag arcsec^-2).
173 HI sources have been found, 96 of which have been uniquely identified with
optical counterparts in the overlap area. There is not a single source without
an optical counterpart. Although we have not measured the column-densities
directly, we have inferred them from the optical sizes of their counterparts.
All appear to have a column-density of N_HI = 10^(20.65 +/- 0.38). This is at
least an order of magnitude above our sensitivity limit, with a scatter only
marginally larger than the errors on N_HI. This needs explaining. If confirmed
it means that HI surveys will only find low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies
with high M_HI/L_B. Gas-rich LSB galaxies with lower HI mass to light ratios do
not exist. The paucity of low column-density galaxies also implies that no
significant population will be missed by the all-sky HI surveys being carried
out at Parkes and Jodrell Bank.

of turbulent density fluctuations in the circumstellar disk. For type I
migration, the planet does not clear a gap in the disk and its secular motion
is driven by torques generated by the wakes it creates in the surrounding disk
fluid. MHD turbulence creates additional density perturbations that
gravitationally interact with the planet and can dominate the torques produced
by the migration mechanism itself. This paper shows that conventional type I
migration can be readily overwhelmed by turbulent perturbations and hence the
usual description of type I migration should be modified in locations where the
magnetorotational instability is active. In general, the migrating planet does
not follow a smooth inward trned, but rather exhibits a random walk through
phase space. Our main conclusion is that MHD turbulence will alter the time
scales for type I planet migration and -- because of chaos -- requires the time
scales to be described by a distribution of values.

that the clustering excess related to the first generation of stars can be

derive the density of energy states, giving the probability that a randomly

expressed approximately as $1/\sqrt{3}(d_{xy}+d_{yz}+d_{zx})$ originating from
a crystal field effect. It is also shown that most of the orbital moment is

the present contribution we present a systematic exploration of the possible
types of behavior of the PDE for thermodynamic states of diverging isothermal
compressibility kappa[T] as the renormalization group theoretical momentum
cutoff approaches zero. By purely analytical means we identify three classes of
asymptotic solutions compatible with infinite kappa[T], characterized by
uniform or slowly varying bounds on the curvature of f, by monotonicity of the
build-up of diverging kappa[T], and by stiffness of the PDE in part of its
domain, respectively. These scenarios are analzyed and discussed with respect

addition to the asymptotic regime where the arguments of part I

rise to transient stiffness at intermediate cutoff for low enough temperature.

that the gauge principle can induce gauge fields only in quantum systems. But
this is not necessary. This paper, of pedagogical scope, presents a classical
system constituted by a particle in a classical potential, which is used as a
model to illustrate the gauge principle and the spontaneous symmetry breaking.
Those concepts appear in the study of second order phase transitions.
Ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, superconductivity, plasmons in a free
electron gas, and the mass of vector bosons in the gauge field Yang-Mills
theories, are some of the phenomena in which these transitions occur.

called a hyperpolygon space, a hyperkahler analogue of the Kahler variety
parametrizing spacial polygons with fixed edge lengths. The ordinary polygon
space can be interpreted as the moduli space of stable representations of a
certain quiver with fixed dimension vector; from this point of view, the
hyperpolygon space is the hyperkahler quiver variety defined by Nakajima. A
quiver variety admits a natural action of the nonzero complex numbers, and the
union of the precompact orbits is called the core. We study the components of
the core of the hyperpolygon space, interpreting each one as a moduli space of
pairs of spatial polygons with certain properties. Konno gives a presentation
of the cohomology ring of the hyperpolygon space; we extend this result by
computing the circle-equivariant cohomology ring, as well as the ordinary and
equivariant cohomology rings of the core components.

production in nuclear collisions by the STAR Collaboration at RHIC. The
previously observed suppression in central Au+Au collisions has been extended
to much higher $p_T$. New measurements from d+Au collisions are presented which
help disentangle the mechanisms responsible for the suppression. Inclusive
single hadron spectra are enhanced in d+Au relative to p+p, while two-particle
azimuthal distributions are observed to be similar in p+p, d+Au and peripheral
Au+Au collisions. The large suppression of inclusive hadron production and
absence of the away-side jet-like correlations in central Au+Au collisions are
shown to be due to interactions of the jets with the very dense medium produced
in these collisions.

investigated using a chiral SU(3) model in the nonlinear realization. The
effect of the baryon Dirac sea is seen to modify hadronic properties and in
contrast to a calculation in mean field approximation it is seen to give rise
to a significant drop of the vector meson masses in hot and dense matter. This
effect is taken into account through the summation of baryonic tadpole diagrams
in the relativistic Hartree approximation (RHA), where the baryon self energy
is modified due to interactions with both the non-strange $(\sigma)$ and the
strange $(\zeta)$ scalar fields.

one-particle density-matrix theory, where this recently introduced formalism is
based on Brueckner-orbital theory and an energy functional that includes exact
exchange and a non-universal correlation-energy functional. The method is
demonstrated to reduce to a density functional theory when the
exchange-correlation energy-functional has a simplified form, i.e., its
integrand contains only the coordinates of two electron, say r1 and r2, and it
has a Dirac delta function -- delta(r1 - r2) -- as a factor. Since Brueckner
and Hartree--Fock orbitals are often very similar, any local exchange
functional that works well with Hartree--Fock theory is a reasonable
approximation with reference-state one-particle density-matrix theory. The LDA
approximation is also a reasonable approximation. However, the Colle--Salvetti
correlation-energy functional, and the LYP variant, are not ideal for the
method, since these are universal functionals. Nevertheless, they appear to
provide reasonable approximations. The B3LYP functional is derived using a
linear combination of two functionals: One is the BLYP functional; the other
uses exact exchange and a correlation-energy functional from the LDA.

a preassigned measure of safety. In order to show the capabilities of different
statistical methods, firstly we have investigated one output variable with
unknown and known distribution functions. The general conclusion has been that
the different methods do not bring about large differences in the number of
runs needed to ensure a given level of safety. Analyzing the case of several
statistically dependent output variables we have arrived at the conclusion that
the testing of the variables separately may lead to false, safety related
decisions with unforseen consequences. We have advised two methods: the sign
test and the tolerance interval methods for testing more than one mutually
dependent output variables.

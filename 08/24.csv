respectively. For high-order quasinormal modes, to which corresponds
quasinormal frequencies with large imaginary parts, on the other hand, this

that the real parts of the quasinormal frequencies have oscillating behaviors

${\rm Re(\omega)}$ as a function of ${\rm Im}(\omega)$ approaches a non-zero

basically two steps: First we explain how to construct finite braid group
orbits of triples of elements of SL_2(C) out of triples of generators of
three-dimensional complex reflection groups. (This involves the Fourier-Laplace
transform for certain irregular connections.) Then we adapt a result of Jimbo
to produce the Painleve VI solutions. (In particular this solves a
Riemann-Hilbert problem explicitly.)
  Each step will be illustrated using the complex reflection group associated
to Klein's simple group of order 168. This leads to a new algebraic solution
with seven branches. We will also prove that, unlike the algebraic solutions of
Dubrovin-Mazzocco and Hitchin, this solution is not equivalent to any solution
coming from a finite subgroup of SL_2(C).

width l with free-slip boundaries. A mini-max variational problem for upper
bounds on the bulk time averaged energy dissipation rate epsilon is derived
from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with no secondary assumptions.
This produces rigorous limits on the power consumption that are valid for
laminar or turbulent solutions. The mini-max problem is solved exactly at high
Reynolds numbers Re = U*l/nu, where U is the rms velocity and nu is the
kinematic viscosity, yielding an explicit bound on the dimensionless asymptotic
dissipation factor beta=epsilon*l/U^3 that depends only on the ``shape'' of the
shearing body force. For a simple half-cosine force profile, for example, the
high Reynolds number bound is beta <= pi^2/sqrt{216} = .6715... . We also
report extensive direct numerical simulations for this particular force shape
up to Re approximately 400; the observed dissipation rates are about a factor
of three below the rigorous high-Re bound. Interestingly, the high-Re optimal
solution of the variational problem bears some qualitative resemblence to the
observed mean flow profiles in the simulations. These results extend and refine

corresponding to the protein-affected region on the membrane, referred to as
the adsorption domain, and the other to the unaffected remainder of the
membrane. We calculated the protein-induced lipid rearrangement in the
adsorption domain as arising from the interplay between the electrostatic
interactions in the system and the mixing entropy of the lipids. Equating the
electrochemical potentials of the lipids in the two blocks yields an expression
for the relations among the various lipid fractions in the adsorption domain,
indicating a sensitive dependence of lipid fraction on valence. This expression
is a result of the two-block picture but does not depend on further details of
the protein-membrane interaction. We subsequently calculated the lipid
fractions themselves using the Poisson-Boltzmann theory. We examined the
dependence of lipid enrichment, i.e., the ratio between the lipid fractions
inside and outside the adsorption domain, on various parameters such as ionic
strength and lipid valence. Maximum enrichment was found for lipid valence of
about (-3) to (-4) in physiological conditions. Our results are in qualitative

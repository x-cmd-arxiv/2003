angles, we reproduce an image of the nebula and compare it with Chandra

  The reproduced image is not a ring-like but rather 'lip-shaped'. It is found
that the assumption of toroidal field does not reproduce the Chandra image. We
must assume that there is disordered magnetic field with an amplitude as large
as the mean toroidal field. In addition, the brightness contrast between the
front and back sides of the ring cannot be reproduced if we assume that the
magnetization parameter $\sigma$ is as small as $\sim 10^{-3}$. The brightness
profile along the semi-major axis of the torus is also examined. The
non-dissipative, ideal-MHD approximation in the nebula appears to break down.
We speculate that if the magnetic energy is released by some process that
produce turbulent field in the nebula flow and causes heating and acceleration,
e.g. by magnetic reconnection, then the present difficulties may be resolved
(i.e. we can reproduce a ring image, and a higher brightness contrast). Thus,
the magnetization parameter $\sigma$ can be larger than previously expected.

uncertainties, empirical values are compared with theoretical predictions
obtained from a set of updated canonical stellar evolution models which have

qualitative agreement between theory and observations. Quantitative estimates
of the confidence level are hampered by current uncertainties on the GCs
metallicity scale, and by the strong dependence of Delta(bump-zahb) on the
cluster metallicity. In case of the R_bump parameter, which is only weakly
affected by the metallicity, we find a very good quantitative agreement between
theoretical canonical models and observations. For our full cluster sample the
average difference between predicted and observed R_bump values is practically
negligible, and ranges from -0.002 to -0.028, depending on the employed
metallicity scale. The observed dispersion around these values is entirely
consistent with the observational errors on R_bump. As a comparison, the value
of R_bump predicted by theory in case of spurious bump detections would be
\~0.10 smaller than the observed ones. We have also tested the influence on the

interested to investigate the effect of ambipolar diffusion on the thermal

stage. In this way, we obtain a non-dimensional characteristic equation which
reduces to the prior characteristic equation in the absence of the magnetic
field and ambipolar diffusion. With numerical manipulation of this
characteristic equation, we conclude that there are solutions where the thermal
instability allows compression along the magnetic field but not perpendicular
to it. We infer that this aspect might be an evidence in formation of observed

designed to determine the properties of their host galaxies. The sample
consists of quasars with absolute magnitudes in the range -24>M_V>-28, allowing
us to investigate host galaxy properties across a decade in quasar luminosity,
but at a single redshift. We find that the hosts of all the RLQs, and all the
RQQs with nuclear luminosities M_V<-24, are massive bulge-dominated galaxies,
confirming and extending the trends deduced from our previous studies. From the
best-fitting model host galaxies we have estimated spheroid and black-hole
masses, and the efficiency (with respect to Eddington luminosity) with which
each quasar is radiating. The largest inferred black-hole mass in our sample is
\~3.10^9 M_sun, comparable to those at the centres of M87 and Cygnus A. We find
no evidence for super-Eddington accretion in even the most luminous objects. We
investigate the role of scatter in the black-hole:spheroid mass relation in
determining the ratio of quasar to host-galaxy luminosity, by generating
simulated populations of quasars lying in hosts with a Schechter mass function.
Within the subsample of the highest luminosity quasars, the observed variation
in nuclear-host luminosity ratio is consistent with being the result of the
scatter in the black-hole:spheroid relation. Quasars with high nuclear-host
ratios can be explained by sub-Eddington accretion onto black holes in the
high-mass tail of the black-hole:spheroid relation. Our results imply that,

linearly with quasar luminosity, at the very highest luminosities. Any quasars
more luminous than M_V=-27 should be found in massive elliptical hosts which at

simulations of the magnetic interaction between a weakly magnetized neutron
star and its accretion disk. General relativistic effects are simulated by
using the pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find that well-collimated jets
traveling along the rotation axis of the disk are formed by the following
mechanism: (1) The magnetic loops connecting the neutron star and the disk are
twisted due to the differential rotation between the neutron star and the disk.
(2) Twist injection from the disk initiates expansion of the loop. (3) The
expanding magnetic loops create a magnetic tower in which accelerated disk
material travel as collimated bipolar jets. The propagation speed of the
working surface of the jet is the order of 10% of the speed of light ($\sim
0.1c$). (4) Magnetic reconnection taking place inside the expanding magnetic
loops injects hot bubbles intermittently into the magnetic tower. The ejection
speed of the bubble is the order of the local Alfv\'{e}n speed of the launching
point and $\sim 0.2c$ in our simulations. (5) The hot bubbles moving inside the
tower catch up with the working surface of the jet. High energy electrons
created by the magnetic reconnection are a plausible source of radio emission.
Our model can explain the formation process of a narrow jet from a weakly
magnetized ($|{\boldmath$B_{*}$}|\le 10^{9}$ gauss) neutron star and the
correlation between radio flares of the core and of the lobe observed in Sco

the galaxy cluster Abell 478. The quasar was discovered as the brightest source
in a submillimetre survey of high redshift galaxies lensed by foreground rich
clusters of galaxies in a project aimed at studying the cosmic star formation
history of dusty galaxies. With submm fluxes of S_850 = 25+-2.8 mJy and S_450 =
55+-17 mJy this object is one of the brightest submillimetre sources known.
Optical observations revealed a quasar with redshift z=2.837. The quasar was
also detected at shorter infrared wavelengths with the Infrared Space
Observatory. This object is the first quasar discovered by its submm emission.
Given the general lack of overlap between deep submm and X-ray samples, usually
interpreted as a low incidence of active nuclei in submm samples, this is an
unusual object. Analysis of number counts of quasars and of submm galaxies
bears out this suggestion. We compare the properties of SMMJ04135+10277 to
those of optically selected quasars with submm emission, and argue that the
optical faintness results from a large viewing angle with the direction of
relativistic beaming, and not from abnormally high extinction. We also find
indications that the bulk of the submm flux density is not powered by the
quasar nucleus. This conclusion is supported by analysis of the infrared
spectral energy distribution. These results are consistent with previous
observations that quasars at higher redshift tend to have a more prominent cold
dust component, most likely powered by extended star formation in the host
galaxy. The quasar is found to have a total infrared luminosity of
(2.9+-0.5)x10^13 L_sun, dominated by the emission from cool dust. (Abridged)

adjust the van Hove singularities to the neighborhood of the Fermi surface

broad peak around $\Gamma$ point. These conditions stabilize the $f$-wave

recently been proposed, which improve the efficiency of simulations of quantum
lattice models. We propose to generalize the detailed balance equations at the
local level during the loop construction by accounting for the matrix elements
of the operators associated with open world-line segments. Using linear
programming techniques to solve the generalized equations, we look for optimal
construction schemes for directed loops. This also allows for an extension of
the directed loop scheme to general lattice models, such as high-spin or
bosonic models. The resulting algorithms are bounce-free in larger regions of
parameter space than the original directed loop algorithm. The generalized
directed loop method is applied to the magnetization process of spin chains in
order to compare its efficiency to that of previous directed loop schemes. In
contrast to general expectations, we find that minimizing bounces alone does
not always lead to more efficient algorithms in terms of autocorrelations of
physical observables, because of the non-uniqueness of the bounce-free
solutions. We therefore propose different general strategies to further
minimize autocorrelations, which can be used as supplementary requirements in
any directed loop scheme. We show by calculating autocorrelation times for
different observables that such strategies indeed lead to improved efficiency;
however we find that the optimal strategy depends not only on the model
parameters but also on the observable of interest.

superconductors with aligned columnar defects introduced by irradiation with
very energetic heavy-ions. We use dc magnetization measurements deep in the
vortex solid phase, and ac susceptibility near the solid-liquid transition. We
show that aligned columnar defects are an excellent tool to test models for
vortex dynamics, particularly if they are tilted with respect to the
crystallographic axes, so their effects can be easily distinguished from those
arising from mass anisotropy, sample geometry, twin boundaries and intrinsic
pinning. This allows us, for instance, to use the uniaxial pinning of the
columnar defects as a probe to determine the orientation of the vortices inside
a bulk material, which in general is different from the orientation of the
applied fields. In some aspects we have found an excellent agreement with the
theoretical expectations of the Bose-glass model. The field dependence of the
lock-in angle follows remarkably well the 1/H prediction over the whole
temperature range of our measurements. In turn, the temperature dependence of
the lock-in angle gives strong support to the concept of an effective pinning
energy dominated by the entropic smearing effect. On the other hand, both our
ac and dc results show that columnar defects produce effective pinning over a
wide angular range, and that correlated pinning dominates the scenario for all
field orientations. One consequence of this is the existence of a rich variety
of vortex staircases.

  Spectral Analysis of Error","33 pages, 6 figures",,,,"math.DS math.SP",,"  This paper has two themes that are intertwined: The first is the dynamics of
certain piecewise affine maps on the Euclidean space that arise from a class of
analog-to-digital conversion methods called Sigma-Delta quantization. The
second is the analysis of reconstruction error associated to each such method.
Sigma-Delta quantization generates approximate representations of functions by
sequences that lie in a restricted set of discrete values. These are special
sequences in that their local averages track the function values closely, thus
enabling simple convolutional reconstruction. In this paper, we are concerned
with the approximation of constant functions only, a basic case that presents
surprisingly complex behavior. An m'th order Sigma-Delta scheme with input x
can be translated into a dynamical system that produces a discrete-valued
sequence (in particular, a 0-1 sequence) q as its output. When the schemes are
stable, we show that the underlying piecewise affine maps possess invariant
sets that tile the Euclidean space up to a finite multiplicity. When this
multiplicity is one (the single-tile case), the dynamics within the tile is
isomorphic to that of a generalized skew translation on the m dimensional
torus. The value of x can be approximated using any consecutive M elements in q
with increasing accuracy in M. We show that the asymptotical behavior of
reconstruction error depends on the regularity of the invariant sets, the order
m, and some arithmetic properties of x. We determine the behavior in a number
of cases of practical interest and provide good upper bounds in some other
cases when exact analysis is not yet available.

Also, we classify all holomorphic discs with boundary lying on the Clifford
torus by establishing a Maslov index formula for such discs. As a result, we
show that in odd dimensions there exist two spin structures which give
non-vanishing Floer cohomology of the Clifford torus, and in even dimensions,
there is only one such spin structure. When the Floer cohomology is
non-vanishing, it is isomorphic to the singular cohomology of the torus (with a
Novikov ring as its coefficients). As a corollary, we prove that any
Hamiltonian deformation of the Clifford torus intersects with it at least at

holomorphic discs (``disc instantons'') attached to Lagrangian torus fibers of
arbitrary compact toric manifolds, and prove their Fredholm regularity. Using
this, we compute Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono's (FOOO's) obstruction (co)chains and the
Floer cohomology of Lagrangian torus fibers of Fano toric manifolds. In
particular specializing to the formal parameter $T^{2\pi} = e^{-1}$, our
computation verifies the folklore that FOOO's obstruction (co)chains correspond
to the Landau-Ginzburg superpotentials under the mirror symmetry
correspondence, and also proves the prediction made by K. Hori about the Floer
cohomology of Lagrangian torus fibers of Fano toric manifolds. The latter
states that the Floer cohomology (for the parameter value $T^{2\pi} = e^{-1}$)
of all the fibers vanish except at a finite number, the Euler characteristic of
the toric manifold, of base points in the momentum polytope that are critical
points of the superpotential of the Landau-Ginzburg mirror to the toric
manifold. In the latter cases, we also prove that the Floer cohomology of the
corresponding fiber is isomorphic to its singular cohomology.
  We also introduce a restricted version of the Floer cohomology of Lagrangian
submanifolds, which is a priori more flexible to define in general, and which
we call the {\it adapted Floer cohomology}. We then prove that the adapted
Floer cohomology of any non-singular torus fiber of Fano toric manifolds is
well-defined, invariant under the Hamiltonian isotopy and isomorphic to the
Bott-Morse Floer cohomology of the fiber.

"math/0308226","Thomas William Dawson","Thomas William Dawson","Extensions of Normed Algebras","Ph.D. Thesis, University of Nottingham, 2003. 76 pages; plain TeX",,,,"math.FA",,"  We review and analyse techniques from the literature for extending a normed
algebra, A to a normed algebra, B, so that B has interesting or desirable
properties which A may lack. For example, B might include roots of monic
polynomials over A.
  These techniques have been important historically for constructing examples
in the theory of Banach algebras. We construct new examples in this way.
Elsewhere we contribute to the related programme of determining which
properties of an algebra are shared by certain extensions of it.
  Similarly, we consider the relations between the topological spaces, M(A) and
M(B), of closed, maximal ideals of A and B respectively. For example, it is
shown that if B is one of the types of 'algebraic extensions' of A constructed
in the thesis and M(B) has trivial first Cech-cohomology group then so has
M(A).
  The invertible group of a normed algebra is studied in Chapter 4; it is shown
that if a Banach algebra, A, has dense invertible group then so has every
integral extension of A. The context for this work is also explained: some new
results characterising trivial uniform algebras by means of approximation by
invertible elements are given. We show how these results partially answer a
famous, open problem of Gelfand.
  Results in Chapter 4 lead to the conjecture that a uniform algebra is trivial
if the group of exponentials of its elements is dense in the algebra. We
investigate this conjecture in Chapter 5. In the search for a counterexample,
we construct and establish some properties of `logarithmic extensions' of a
regular uniform algebra.

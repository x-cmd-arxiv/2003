PG1544+488 and JL87, reveal extremely strong C III lines at 977 and 1176A,
while the carbon lines are quite weak in the third star, LB1766. We have
analyzed the FUSE data using TLUSTY NLTE line-blanketed model atmospheres, and
find that PG1544+488 has a surface composition of 96% He, 2% C, and 1% N. JL87
shows a similar surface enrichment of carbon and nitrogen, but some significant
fraction of hydrogen still remains in its atmosphere. LB1766 has a surface
composition devoid of hydrogen and strongly depleted of carbon, indicating that
its surface material has undergone CN-cycle processing. We interpret these
observations with new evolutionary calculations which suggest that He-rich sdB
stars with C-rich compositions are the progeny of stars which underwent a
delayed He-core flash on the white-dwarf cooling curve. During such a flash the
interior convection zone will penetrate into the H envelope, thereby mixing the
envelope with the He- and C-rich core. Such `flash-mixed' stars will arrive on
the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) with He- and C-rich surface compositions
and will be hotter than the hottest canonical (i.e., unmixed) EHB stars. Two
types of flash mixing are possible: `deep' and `shallow', depending on whether
the H envelope is mixed deeply into the site of the He flash or only with the
outer layers of the core. Based on both their stellar parameters and surface
compositions, we suggest that PG1544+488 and JL87 are examples of `deep' and
`shallow' flash mixing, respectively. Flash mixing may therefore represent a
new evolutionary channel for producing the hottest EHB stars. However, flash
mixing cannot explain the abundance pattern in LB1766, which remains a
challenge to current evolutionary models.

papers have drawn attention to the possibility of measuring $\alpha_s$ by
combining the CMB with galaxy clustering and/or the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Weak
lensing combined with the CMB provides an alternative probe of the primordial
power spectrum. We run a series of simulations with variable runnings and
compare them to semi-analytic non-linear mappings to test their validity for
our calculations. We find that a ``Reference'' cosmic shear survey with
$f_{sky}=0.01$ and $6.6\times 10^8$ galaxies per steradian can reduce the
uncertainty on $n_s$ and $\alpha_s$ by roughly a factor of 2 relative to the
CMB alone. We investigate the effect of shear calibration biases on lensing by
including the calibration factor as a parameter, and show that for our
Reference Survey, the precision of cosmological parameter determination is only
slightly degraded even if the amplitude calibration is uncertain by as much as
5%. We conclude that in the near future weak lensing surveys can supplement the
CMB observations to constrain the primordial power spectrum.

segregation of massive main-sequence stars and the development of the Spitzer

initial half-mass relaxation time. If the core collapse time is less than the
lifetime of the massive stars, all stars in the collapsing core may then
undergo a runaway collision process leading to the formation of a massive black
hole. Here we study in detail the first step in this process, up to the
occurrence of core collapse. We have performed about 100 simulations for
clusters with a wide variety of initial conditions, varying systematically the
cluster density profile, stellar IMF, and number of stars. We also considered
the effects of initial mass segregation and stellar evolution mass loss. Our
results show that, for clusters with a moderate initial central concentration
and any realistic IMF, the ratio of core collapse time to initial half-mass
relaxation time is typically ~0.1, in agreement with the value previously found
by direct N-body simulations for much smaller systems. Models with even higher
central concentration initially, or with initial mass segregation (from star
formation) have even shorter core-collapse times. Remarkably, we find that, for
all realistic initial conditions, the mass of the collapsing core is always
close to ~10^-3 of the total cluster mass, very similar to the observed
correlation between central black hole mass and total cluster mass in a variety
of environments. We discuss the implications of our results for the formation
of intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters and super star clusters,
ultraluminous X-ray sources, and seed black holes in proto-galactic nuclei.

we performed several numerical experiments by using the simplified analytical
EOS originally developed by Stellingwerf and the recent analytical EOS
developed by Irwin. Current findings suggest that the pulsation amplitudes as
well as the topology of the instability strip marginally depend on the adopted
EOS.
  We also investigated the dependence of observables predicted by theoretical
models on the mass-luminosity (ML) relation and on the spatial resolution
across the Hydrogen and the Helium partial ionization regions. We found that
nonlinear models are marginally affected by these physical and numerical
assumptions. In particular, the difference between new and old models in the
location as well as in the temperature width of the instability strip is on
average smaller than 200 K. However, the spatial resolution somehow affects the
pulsation properties. The new fine models predict a period at the center of the
Hertzsprung Progression ($P_{HP}=9.65$$-$9.84 days) that reasonably agree with
empirical data based on light curves ($P_{HP}=10.0\pm 0.5$ days;

find that models with a cut off in the power spectrum at large scales are
indeed preferred by data, but only by a factor of 3.6, at most, in the
likelihood ratio, corresponding to about ``1.5 sigma'' if interpreted in the
traditional manner. Using the same technique, we have also examined the

to half-filling: the hole-doped system at low temperatures develops a
Resonating Valence Bond (RVB)-like d-wave gap (pseudogap close to ($\pi$,0))
coinciding with gapless nodal excitations (nodal liquid); in contrast, the
electron-doped system is seen to develop a Mott gap at the nodes, whilst
retaining a metallic character of its majority Fermi surface. At lower
temperatures in the electron-doped case, d-wave superconducting correlations --
here, coexisting with gapped nodal excitations -- are already seen to arise.
Upon further doping the hole-doped case, the RVB-like state yields to d-wave
superconductivity. Such physics is reminiscent of that exhibited by the high
temperature cuprate superconductors--notably electron-hole asymmetry as noted
by Angle Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy (ARPES) and the resistivity
exponents observed. This toy model also reinforces the importance of a more
thorough experimental investigation of the known 3-leg ladder cuprate systems,

asymptotic linear spreading velocity v*, the asymptotic rate with which
initially localized perturbations spread into an unstable state according to
the linear dynamical equations obtained by linearizing the fully nonlinear
equations about the unstable state. This allows us to give a precise definition
of pulled fronts, nonlinear fronts whose asymptotic propagation speed equals
v*, and pushed fronts, nonlinear fronts whose asymptotic speed v^dagger is
larger than v*. In addition, this approach allows us to clarify many aspects of
the front selection problem, the question whether for a given dynamical
equation the front is pulled or pushed. It also is the basis for the universal
expressions for the power law rate of approach of the transient velocity v(t)
of a pulled front as it converges toward its asymptotic value v*. Almost half
of the paper is devoted to reviewing many experimental and theoretical examples
of front propagation into unstable states from this unified perspective. The
paper also includes short sections on the derivation of the universal power law
relaxation behavior of v(t), on the absence of a moving boundary approximation

solvent surrounding a Gaussian, charged chain and derive an effective
short-ranged potential between the charges on the chain. This potential is
repulsive at short separations and attractive at longer distances. The chemical
potential can be derived from this potential. When the chemical potential is
positive, it leads to a melt-like state. For a vanishingly low concentration of
segments, this state exhibits scaling behavior for long chains. The Flory
exponent characterizing the radius of gyration for long chains is calculated to
be approximately 0.63, close to the classical value obtained for second order
phase transitions. For short chains, the radius of gyration varies linearly
with $N$, the chain length, and is sensitive to the parameters in the
interaction potential. The linear dependence on the chain length $N$ indicates
a stiff behavior. The chemical potential associated with this interaction
changes sign, when the screening length in the ionic solvent exceeds a critical
value. This leads to condensation when the chemical potential is negative. In
this state, it is shown using the mean-field approximation that spherical and
toroidal condensed shapes can be obtained. The thickness of the toroidal
polyelectrolyte is studied as a function of the parameters of the model, such
as the ionic screening length. The predictions of this theory should be
amenable to experimental verification.

well-defined space-time structure (order) in topological charge density

not less than one; (c) the structure has a long-range global character
(spreading over maximal space-time distances) and is built around the locally

on certain aspects and implications of these results.

roll very slowly over cosmological time scales, and so typically demand
extremely flat potentials. Sufficiently flat potentials are notoriously
difficult to obtain from realistic theories of microscopic physics, and this
poses a naturalness problem for both types of cosmologies. We propose a
brane-world-based microscopic mechanism for generating scalar potentials which
can naturally be flat enough for both types of cosmological applications. The
scalars of interest are higher-dimensional bulk pseudo-Goldstone bosons whose
scale of symmetry breaking is exponentially suppressed in the
higher-dimensional theory by the separation between various branes. The light
scalars appear in the effective 4D theory as pseudo-Goldstone bosons. Since
naturalness problems are more severe for quintessence models, motivated by our
construction we explore in more detail the possibilities for using
pseudo-Goldstone bosons to build quintessence models. Depending on how the
cosmological constant problem is solved, these models typically imply the
universe is now entering a matter-dominated oscillatory phase for which the
equation of state parameter w = p/rho oscillates between w = 1 and w = -1.

via the photon-mirror photon kinetic mixing interaction -- causing mirror
charged particles to couple to ordinary photons with effective electric charge
$\epsilon e$. This means that the nuclei of mirror atoms can elastically
scatter off the nuclei of ordinary atoms, leading to nuclear recoils, which can
be detected in existing dark matter experiments. We show that the dark matter
experiments most sensitive to this type of dark matter candidate (via the
nuclear recoil signature) are the DAMA/NaI and CRESST/Sapphire experiments.

T-smooth, i.e. smooth of the expected dimension, whenever they are non-empty.
For families with more complicated singularities this is no longer true. Given
a divisor D on a smooth projective surface it thus makes sense to look for
conditions which ensure that the family V of irreducible curves in the linear
system |D| with precisely r singular points of types S1,...,Sr is T-smooth.
Considering different surfaces including the projective plane, general surfaces
in projective 3-space, products of curves and geometrically ruled surfaces, we
produce a sufficient condition of the type gamma_a(S1)+...+gamma_a(Sr) <
c*(D-K)^2, where gamma_a is some invariant of the singularity type and c is
some constant. This generalises the results obtained by Greuel, Lossen and

the Taylor-Couette flow between rotating cylinders occurs at the value of
Reynold's number predicted by local bifurcation theory. However, the symmetry
breaking induced by the top and bottom plates means that the true situation
should be a disconnected pitchfork. Indeed, experiments have shown that the
fold of the disconnected branch can occur at more than double the Reynold's
number of onset. This leads to an apparent contradiction: why should Taylor
vortices set in so sharply at the value Reynold's number predicted by the
symmetric theory, given such large symmetry-breaking effects caused by the
boundary conditions? This paper offers a generic explanation. The details are
worked out using a Swift-Hohenberg pattern formation model that shares the same
qualitative features as the Taylor-Couette flow. Onset occurs via a wall mode
whose exponential tail penetrates further into the bulk of the domain as the
driving parameter increases. In a large domain of length L, we show that the
wall mode creates significant amplitude in the centre at parameter values that
are O(L^{-2}) away from the value of onset in the problem with ideal boundary
conditions. We explain this as being due to a Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcation in
space, which occurs at the same parameter value as the pitchfork bifurcation of
the temporal dynamics. The disconnected anomalous branch remains O(1) away from
the onset parameter since it does not arise as a bifurcation from the wall
mode.

Results on cross sections and hyperon polarizations are presented as a function

production rises steeply with energy close to threshold, whereas the Sigma0
cross section rises slowly to a maximum at about E_gamma = 1.45 GeV. Cross
sections together with their angular decompositions into Legendre polynomials
suggest contributions from resonance production for both reactions. In general,
the induced polarization of Lambda has negative values in the kaon forward

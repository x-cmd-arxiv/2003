The IR and radio point source counts are based on observations by the the SCUBA
and WMAP instruments respectively. We show that the contributions from IR
source counts, when extrapolated from the SCUBA frequency of 350GHz to the
operating frequencies of these surveys (~100-300GHz), can be a significant
source of additional `noise' which needs to be accounted for in order to
extract the optimal science from these surveys. Alternatively, these surveys
give us an opportunity to study IR sources, their numbers and clustering
properties, opening a new window to the high redshift universe. For the radio
point sources, the contribution depends on a more uncertain extrapolation from
40GHz but is comparable to the IR near 200GHz. However, the radio signal may be
correlated with clusters of galaxies and have a disproportionately larger
effect.

central energy sources of $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs). After the GRB, such a
magnetar-like object may directly lose its rotational energy through some
magnetically-driven processes, which produce an ultrarelativistic wind
dominated possibly by the energy flux of electron-positron pairs. The
interaction of such a wind with an outward-expanding fireball leads to a
relativistic wind bubble, being regarded as a relativistic version of the
well-studied Crab Nebula. We here explore the dynamics of this wind bubble and
its emission signatures. We find that when the injection energy significantly
exceeds the initial energy of the fireball, the bulk Lorentz factor of the wind
bubble decays more slowly than before, and more importantly, the reverse-shock
emission could dominate the afterglow emission, which yields a bump in
afterglow light curves. In addition, high polarization of the bump emission
would be expected if a toroidal magnetic field in the shocked wind dominates
over the random component.

prominent red horizontal branch (RHB), asymptotic giant branch (AGB), about 120
variable star candidates including RR Lyraes and anomalous Cepheids, about 230
blue stragglers (BSs), and main sequence (MS) stars. The distance to the galaxy

[Fe/H]=-2.1+/-0.1(statistical error) +/-0.2(standard calibration error) dex,
with a dispersion of sigma[Fe/H]=0.2 dex. The age of the MSTO of the main old
population is estimated to be similar to that of M92, and there are seen some
stellar populations with younger age. There is found to be one RGB bump at
V=19.95+/-0.05 mag (M_V=0.03 mag), and a weak brighter bump at V=19.35+/-0.05
mag(Mv=-0.58 mag) which is probably an AGB bump. The V-band luminosity function
of the RGB and MS stars is in general similar to that of M92, with a slight
excess of stars in the magnitude range brighter than the MSTO with respect to
that of M92. The bright BSs are more centrally concentrated than the faint BSs.
Significant radial gradients are seen for several kinds of populations: the
RHB, the red RGB, the red subgiant branch (SGB), and the bright BSs are more
centrally concentrated toward the center of the galaxy, compared with the BHB,
the blue RGB, the blue SGB, and the faint BSs, respectively.

remnants (SNRs) has strengthened the hypothesis that primary Galactic
cosmic-ray electrons are accelerated in SNRs. High energy electrons lose energy
via synchrotron and inverse Compton processes during propagation in the Galaxy.
Due to these radiative losses, TeV electrons liberated from SNRs at distances
larger than ~1 kpc, or times older than ~10^5 yr, cannot reach the solar
system. We investigated the cosmic-ray electron spectrum observed in the solar
system using an analytical method, and considered several candidate sources
among nearby SNRs which may contribute to the high energy electron flux.
Especially, we discuss the effects for the release time from SNRs after the
explosion, as well as the deviation of a source spectrum from a simple
power-law. From this calculation, we found that some nearby sources such as the
Vela, Cygnus Loop, or Monogem could leave unique signatures in the form of
identifiable structure in the energy spectrum of TeV electrons and show
anisotropies towards the sources, depending on when the electrons are liberated
from the remnant. This suggests that, in addition to providing information on
the mechanisms of acceleration and propagation of cosmic-rays, specific
cosmic-ray sources can be identified through the precise electron observation
in the TeV region.

compare with the analytic prediction in perturbation theory recently derived by
one of us. Using a series of cosmological N-body simulations, we extensively
examine the time evolution and the dependence on the configuration of triangles
and the sampling volume. Overall we find that the numerical results are
remarkably consistent with the analytic formula from the perturbation theory.
Interestingly the validity of the perturbation theory at a scale k is
determined by P(k)/V_samp, the ratio of the power spectrum P(k) and the
sampling volume V_samp, not by k^3P(k) as in the case of the conventional
cosmological perturbation theory. Consequently this statistics of phase
correlations is sensitive to the size of the sampling volume itself. This
feature does not show up in more conventional cosmological statistics including
the one-point density distribution function and the two-point correlation
functions except as a sample-to-sample variation. Similarly if the sampling
volume size V_samp is fixed, the stronger phase correlation emerges first at
the wavevector where P(k) becomes largest, i.e., in linear regimes according to
the standard cosmological perturbation theory, while the distribution of the
phase sum stays fairly uniform in nonlinear regimes. The above feature can be
naturally understood from the corresponding density structures in real space as
we discuss in detail.

Kramers doublet crystal electric field (CEF) ground state. $\chi^{qp}_{\gamma}$
is calculated from the enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma_{el}$ and
$\chi^{qp}_{T_1}$ from the quasi-particle Korringa relation
$T_1T(K^{qp}_{T_1})^2=const.$ via the relation of
$\chi^{qp}_{T_1}=(N_A\mu_B/A_{hf})K^{qp}_{T_1}$ where $A_{hf}$ is the hyperfine
coupling constant, $N_A$ the Abogadoro's number and $\mu_B$ the Bohr magneton.
For the even-parity (spin-singlet) superconductors CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, CeCoIn$_5$
and UPd$_2$Al$_3$, the fractional decrease in the Knight shift, $\delta
K^{obs}$, below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) is due to
the decrease of the spin susceptibility of heavy quasi-particle estimated
consistently from $\chi^{qp}_{\gamma}$ and $\chi^{qp}_{T_1}$. This result
allows us to conclude that the heavy quasi-particles form the spin-singlet
Cooper pairs in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, CeCoIn$_5$ and UPd$_2$Al$_3$. On the other

using the effective potential method. In general, explicit CP violation is

conserving by assuming that all the relevant parameters are real. However, the

scalar-pseudoscalar mixings are found to strongly dependent on this phase.
Meanwhile, for a wide region in the parameter space, the ratios of CP mixing
elements of the neutral Higgs boson mass matrix to CP non-mixing ones increase
weakly against this phase. Also, the neutral Higgs boson masses are roughly

derived for the bispinor field of a free lepton in this Finslerian microspace
through its quantum generalization below a fundamental length-scale. The
bispinor can be decomposed as a direct product of two spinsors, one depending
on the position coordinates and the other on the directional arguments of the
Finsler space. The former one represents the spinor of the macrospace, an
associated Riemannian space-time of the Finsler space, and satisfies the Dirac
equation. The directional variable-dependent spinor satisfies a different
equation which is solved here. This spinor-part of the bispinor field for a

generating the internal symmetry of hadrons. Also, it is seen that in the

a problem to compute a solution. On a quantum computer there are different
realizations of a query and we will show that these are not always equivalent.
Our definition of equivalence is based on the ability to simulate (or
approximate) one query type by another. We show that a bit query can always
approximate a phase query with just two queries, while there exist problems for
which the number of phase queries which are necessary to approximate a bit
query must grow exponentially with the precision of the bit query. This result
follows from the query complexity bounds for the evaluation problem, for which
we establish a strong lower bound for the number of phase queries by exploiting
a relation between quantum algorithms and trigonometric polynomials.

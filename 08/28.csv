M-type dwarf stars via high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements.
Although more than 100 extrasolar planets have been found around solar-type
stars of spectral type F to K, there is only a single M-dwarf (GJ 876, Delfosse
et al. 1998; Marcy et al. 1998; Marcy et al. 2001) known to harbor a planetary
system. With the current incompleteness of Doppler surveys with respect to
M-dwarfs, it is not yet possible to decide whether this is due to a fundamental
difference in the formation history and overall frequency of planetary systems
in the low-mass regime of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, or simply an
observational bias. Our HET M-dwarf survey plans to survey 100 M-dwarfs in the
next 3 to 4 years with the primary goal to answer this question. Here we
present the results from the first year of the survey which show that our
routine RV-precision for M-dwarfs is 6 m/s. We found that GJ 864 and GJ 913 are
binary systems with yet undetermined periods, while 5 out of 39 M-dwarfs reveal
a high RV-scatter and represent candidates for having short-periodic planetary
companions. For one of them, GJ 436 (rms = 20.6 m/s), we have already obtained
follow-up observations but no periodic signal is present in the RV-data.

functions that come from rotating (Kerr) black hole orbits. It can be
particularly useful to work with the frequency domain representation of those
functions, in order to bring out their harmonic dependence upon the fundamental
orbital frequencies of Kerr black holes. Although, as has recently been shown
by W. Schmidt, such a frequency domain representation must exist, the coupled
nature of a black hole orbit's $r$ and $\theta$ motions makes it difficult to
construct such a representation in practice. Combining Schmidt's description
with a clever choice of timelike coordinate suggested by Y. Mino, we have
developed a simple procedure that sidesteps this difficulty. One first Fourier
expands all quantities using Mino's time coordinate $\lambda$. In particular,
the observer's time $t$ is decomposed with $\lambda$. The frequency domain
description is then built from the $\lambda$-Fourier expansion and the
expansion of $t$. We have found this procedure to be quite simple to implement,
and to be applicable to a wide class of functionals. We test the procedure
using a simple test function, and then apply it in a particularly interesting
case, the Weyl curvature scalar $\psi_4$ used in black hole perturbation
theory.

considering the higher mass main sequence stellar membership of the groups

that this process is dominated by two or more heating mechanisms, which
increase the random motions of stars in the disk. In particular, the
gravitational influence of giant molecular clouds and irregularities in the
spiral potential have been proposed to explain the observed velocity
dispersions in the solar neighborhood. Each of these mechanisms acts on
different components of the stellar velocities, which affects the ratio of the
vertical and radial components of the stellar velocity dispersion since the
relative strengths of giant molecular clouds and spiral irregularities vary
with Hubble type. A study of this ratio as function of Hubble type has the
potential to provide strong constraints on disk heating mechanisms. We present
major and minor axis stellar kinematics for four spiral galaxies of Hubble type
from Sa to Sbc, and use the data to infer the ratios sigma_z/sigma_R in the
galaxy disks. The results combined with two galaxies studied previously and
with Milky Way data show that the ratio is generally in the range 0.5 - 0.8.
There is a marginally significant trend of decreasing ratio with advancing
Hubble type, consistent with the predictions of disk heating theories. However,
the errors on individual measurements are large, and the absence of any trend
is consistent with the data at the 1-sigma level. As a byproduct of our study,
we find that three of the four galaxies in our sample have a central drop in
their stellar line-of-sight velocity dispersion, a phenomenon that is
increasingly observed in spiral galaxies. [ABRIDGED]

the hard band between the Chandra Deep Field data and the previous ASCA data.
We check whether there is any systematic difference in the source density
between cluster and non-cluster fields and also search for field-to-field
variations, both of which have been previously reported. We found no
significant field-to-field cosmic variation in either test within the
statistics (~1 sigma) across the flux levels included in our sample. In the
X-ray color-color plot, most sources fall in the location characterized by
photon index = 1.5-2 and NH = a few x 10^20 cm^2, suggesting that they are
typical broad-line AGNs. There also exist a considerable number of sources with
peculiar X-ray colors (e.g., highly absorbed, very hard, very soft). We confirm
a trend that on average the X-ray color hardens as the count rate decreases.
Since the hardening is confined to the softest energy band (0.3-0.9 keV), we
conclude it is most likely due to absorption. We cross-correlate the X-ray
sources with other catalogs and describe their properties in terms of optical
color, X-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio and X-ray colors.

remnants (SNRs) known or suspected to possess non-thermal components to their
X-ray emission using new and archived observations made with such X-ray
satellites as ROSAT, ASCA, RXTE, Chandra and XMM-Newton. This research is
intended to probe the phenomenon of cosmic-ray acceleration by Galactic SNRs
and estimate the maximum energy of cosmic-ray electrons accelerated by these
sources. To illustrate this work, we examine the X-ray spectrum of the
northwestern rim of an SNR suspected to have a non-thermal component to its
X-ray emission, G156.2+5.7 (RX J04591+5147), over the energy range of
approximately 0.7-12.0 keV using observations made by the ASCA GIS and the RXTE
PCA. We compare fits made to the non-thermal component using two models, a
simple power law and SRCUT. Both models give acceptable fits: the photon index
derived from the fit made with the power law model, 2.0 (+0.2, -0.5), is
comparable to values obtained for the bright rims of other SNRs with hard X-ray
spectra. Using the SRCUT model, we derive a value of 2.42 (+0.24, -0.23) x
10^17 Hz for the cutoff frequency: based on this value and assuming a mean
magnetic field strength of 14 microGauss, we estimate the cutoff energy of
cosmic-ray electrons accelerated by G156.2+5.7 to be approximately 32 TeV. This
energy value is well short of the ""knee"" feature of the cosmic-ray spectrum.

is less than the ~32% measured among early M dwarfs over the same separation

Despite very different current star formation rates, our Halpha imaging
revealed a large web of diffuse Halpha filaments and shells in both IC10 and

power emission of both objects shows bright peaks either at the positions of
optically strong star-forming clumps (IC10) or individual HII regions or

presence of a diffuse, mostly random magnetic field of ~14muG strength,
probably generated by a fluctuation dynamo. One of the Halpha-emitting

rediscuss the reddening of IC10 and its implications for its distance. In the

terms of a model in which a rotating ring of sparks on the polar cap gives rise
to emission from regions of the magnetsophere connected to the sparks by
dipolar magnetic field lines. The spacing of drift-bands in time depends on the
circulation rate of the polar cap pattern, but to first order the longitudinal
phase dependence of the subpulse modulation should obey a frequency-independent
relation determined by the geometrical configuration in a similar manner to the
polarization position angle. We present here observations at 272-1380 MHz of
PSR B0320+39 and PSR B0809+74, both of which show nearly linear drift in two
longitude regions, separated by a region of reduced modulation and accompanied
by a large step in the phase of the subpulse pattern. We show that the
observation of Bartel et al. (1981) that the subpulse spacing for PSR B0809+74
was 1.8 times greater at 102.5 MHz than at 1720 MHz is most likely an artifact
of the phase step, which is only present at high frequencies. The phase steps
can be understood as a consequence of observing overlapping offset images of
the polar cap spark pattern. We also detected more complicated,
frequency-dependent behaviour that would require that the images do not simply
differ by rotation about their centers. Detailed modelling of non-axisymmetric
refraction or distorted magnetic fields is suggested as a means of pursuing an
explanation for this phenomenon.

anelastic and slow-rotation approximations. We consider a simple two-fluid
model of a superfluid neutron star, where one fluid consists of the superfluid
neutrons and the second fluid contains all the comoving constituents (protons,
electrons). The two fluids are assumed to be ``free'' in the sense that
vortex-mediated forces like mutual friction or pinning are absent, but they can
be coupled by the equation of state, in particular by entrainment. The
stationary background consists of the two fluids rotating uniformly around the
same axis with potentially different rotation rates. We study the special cases
of co-rotating backgrounds, vanishing entrainment, and the purely toroidal
r-modes, analytically. We calculate numerically the eigenfunctions and
frequencies of inertial modes in the general case of non co-rotating
backgrounds, and study their dependence on the relative rotation rate and
entrainment. In these non-stratified models we find avoided crossings only
between associated mode-pairs, eg. an ``ordinary'' mode and its ``superfluid''
counterpart, while other mode-frequencies generally cross as the background
parameters are varied. We confirm (for the first time in a mode calculation)
the onset of a ``two-stream instability'' at a critical relative background
rotation rate, and study some of the properties of this instability for the
inertial modes.

quasars. We find that low-ionization BALQSOs (LoBALs) are significantly
reddened as compared to normal quasars, in agreement with previous work.
High-ionization BALQSOs (HiBALs) are also more reddened than the average
nonBALQSO. Assuming SMC-like dust reddening at the quasar redshift, the amount
of reddening needed to explain HiBALs is E(B-V)~0.023 and LoBALs is
E(B-V)~0.077 (compared to the ensemble average of the entire quasar sample). We
find that there are differences in the emission-line properties between the
average HiBAL, LoBAL, and nonBAL quasar. These differences, along with
differences in the absorption line troughs, may be related to intrinsic quasar
properties such as the slope of the intrinsic (unreddened) continuum; more
extreme absorption properties are correlated with bluer intrinsic continua.
Despite the differences among BALQSO sub-types and nonBALQSOs, BALQSOs appear
to be drawn from the same parent population as nonBALQSOs when both are
selected by their UV/optical properties. We find that the overall fraction of
traditionally defined BALQSOs, after correcting for color-dependent selection
effects due to different SEDs of BALQSO and nonBALQSOs, is 13.4+/-1.2% and
shows no significant redshift dependence for 1.7<z<3.45. After a rough
completeness correction for the effects of dust extinction, we find that
approximately one in every six quasars is a BALQSO.

variations observed in the UV-to-optical flux ratio driven by variations in the
number of EHB stars, and not the type of UV-bright stars. Deep UV images of the
nearest elliptical galaxy, M32, show that it has a well-populated EHB, even
though it has the weakest UV upturn of any known elliptical galaxy. However,
M32 suffers from a striking dearth of the hot post-HB stars expected from
canonical evolutionary theory. As we observe to larger lookback times in more
distant galaxy clusters, the UV upturn fades, as predicted by theories of
stellar and galactic evolution, but does so gradually. Because the EHB stars do
not appear suddenly in the Universe, their presence is likely driven by a large

Both these new terms represent four-site interactions. The model is solved

phase diagram of the system as a function of the energies. For a proper choice
of the interaction energies, the model exhibits a first-order melting
transition between a liquid and a crystalline phase. The continuation of the
liquid phase below this temperature gives rise to a supercooled liquid, which
turns continuously into a new low-temperature phase, called metastable liquid.

We identify the elementary stacking fault as a boundary between two pure

faults produce response force patterns that can be viewed as resulting from
repetitions of this basic defect. As the number of stacking faults increases,
the intensity pattern evolves toward that of an hexagonal-close-packed crystal.

general microscopic lattice model of a compressible and interacting
multi-component mixture of linear polymers of fixed lengths. The model contains
several microscopic, i.e. bare parameters determining the thermodynamic state
of the system. General arguments are given to show that these parameters must
be independent not only of the lattice properties but also of the thermodynamic
state, and that the voids representing free volume must be carefully treated,
if thermodynamics has to be properly obeyed. These facts have not always been
appreciated in the literature. We focus on mixing functions, some of which have
not been properly calculated in the literature. In general, mixing is
non-isometric (non-zero volume of mixing) and the entropy of mixing is
non-ideal. We have recently developed a lattice theory for the general model,
which goes beyond the random mixing approximation (RMA) limit and is
thermodynamically consistent in the entire parameter space. The theory contains
terms that do not have a continuum analog except in the RMA limit or for
point-like particles. Both the free volume and the total volume determine the
thermodynamics of the system. The RMA limit of our theory gives rise to a new
theory, which can be taken as the extension of the conventional incompressible
Flory-Huggins theory and is similar in simplicity. Using our complete theory,
we calculate the effects of size disparity and interactions on the
thermodynamics of the model. Cohesive energies are not constant in general.
Non-isometry can make the energy of mixing negative, even when all exchange
interactions are repulsive. Consequently, Scatchard-Hildebrand theory cannot be
substantiated in general. Various unusual features are noted and discussed.

$|\eta(D^*)|<1.5$ are compared to different QCD calculations incorporating
different parameterisations of the parton densities in the proton. The data
show sensitivity to the gluon distribution in the proton and are reasonably
well described by next-to-leading-order QCD with the ZEUS NLO QCD fit used as
the input parton density in the proton. The observed cross section is
extrapolated to the full kinematic region in $p_T(D^*)$ and $\eta(D^*)$ in
order to determine the open-charm contribution, $F_2^{\rm charm}(x,Q^2)$, to
the proton structure function, $F_2$. Since, at low $Q^2$, the uncertainties of
the data are comparable to those from the QCD fit, the measured differential
cross sections in $y$ and $Q^2$ should be used in future fits to constrain the

processes both of perturbative and intrinsically nonperturbative nature.

regularization, is used to approach this problem. The dynamics is rigorously
established for linear Hamiltonians, and the difficulties presented by more
general Hamiltonians are addressed.

points in a symmetric spaceof unitary unimodular symmetric matrices. The
scaling foliation of the moduli space is identified to the gradient flow of the
character of a virtual representation of SO(6). Its generic orbits are
connected components of real parts of elliptic curves which form a net of
biquadratic curves with 8 points in common. We show that generically these
curves are the same as the characteristic variety of the associated quadratic
algebra. We then apply the general theory of central quadratic forms to show
that the noncommutative 3-spheres admit a natural ramified covering $\pi$ by a
noncommutative 3-dimensional nilmanifold. This yields the differential
calculus. We then compute the Jacobian of the ramified covering $\pi$ by
pairing the direct image of the fundamental class of the noncommutative
3--dimensional nilmanifold with the Chern character of the defining unitary and
obtain the answer as the product of a period (of an elliptic integral) by a
rational function...

NIMROD, and with Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics model calculations
employing effective interactions corresponding to soft and stiff equations of
state (EOS). Direct experimental observables, such as multiplicity
distributions, charge distributions, energy spectra and velocity spectra, have
been compared in detail with those of the calculations and a reasonable
agreement is obtained. The velocity distributions of $\alpha$ particles and
fragments with Z >= 3 show distinct differences in calculations with the soft
EOS and the stiff EOS. The velocity distributions of $\alpha$ particle and
Intermediate Mass Fragments (IMF's) are best described by the stiff EOS.
Neither of the above direct observables nor the strength of the elliptic flow
are sensitive to changes in the in-medium nucleon-nucleon (NN) cross sections.
A detailed analysis of the central collision events calculated with the stiff
EOS revealed that multifragmentation with cold fragment emission is a common
feature predicted for all reactions studied here. A possible multifragmentation
scenario is presented; after the preequilibrium emission ceases in the
composite system, cold light fragments are formed in a hotter gas of nucleons
and stay cold until the composite system underdoes multifragmentation. For
reaction with 197Au at 47A MeV a significant radial expansion takes place. For
reactions with 58Ni and 92Mo at 47A MeV semi-transparency becomes prominent.
The differing reaction dynamics drastically change the kinematic
characteristics of emitted fragments. This scenario gives consistent
explanations for many existing experimental results in the Fermi energy domain.

based upon a decomposition of the displacement into two scalar potentials, and
results in a fully explicit fluid-solid coupling strategy. The implementation

chaotic system, Duffing oscillator. We quantize it on the basis of quantum
state diffusion (QSD) which is a certain formulation for open quantum systems
and an effective tool for analyzing complex problems numerically. We consider a
sensitivity to initial conditions, `` pseudo-Lyapunov exponent '', and
investigate it in detail, varying Planck constant effectively. We show that in
a dissipative system there exists a certain critical stage in which the
crossover from classical to quantum behavior occurs. Furthermore, we show that
an effect of dissipation suppresses the occurrence of chaos in the quantum
region, while it, combined with the periodic external force, plays a crucial
role in the chaotic behaviors of classical system.

in a resonant optically dense coherent medium is considered. A special
attention is paid to the case, where the density of two-level particles is high
enough that a considerable part of the energy of relatively weak external
laser-fields can be coherently absorbed and reemitted by the medium. Thus, the
field of medium reaction plays a key role in the interaction processes, which
leads to the collective behavior of an atomic ensemble in the strongly coupled
light-matter system. Such behavior results in the fast excitation interchanges
between the field and a medium in the form of the optical ringing, which is
analogous to polariton beating in the solid-state optics. This collective
oscillating response, which can be treated as successive beats between light
wave-packets of different group velocities, is shown to significantly affect
propagation and amplification of the probe field under its nonlinear
interaction with a nearly copropagating pump pulse. Depending on the probe-pump
time delay, the probe transmission spectra show the appearance of either
specific doublet or coherent dip. The widths of these features are determined
by the density-dependent field-matter coupling coefficient and increase during
the propagation. Besides that, the widths of the coherent features, which
appear close to the resonance in the broadband probe-spectrum, exceed the
absorption-line width, since, under the strong-coupling regime, the frequency
of the optical ringing exceeds the rate of incoherent relaxation. Contrary to
the stationary strong-field effects, the density- and coordinate-dependent
transmission spectra of the probe manifest the importance of the collective
oscillations and cannot be obtained in the framework of the single-atom model.

particles under Lorentz boost, we first introduce a relevant relativistic spin
observable, and evaluate its expectation values for the Bell states under
Lorentz boost. Then we show that maximal violation of the Bell's inequality can
be achieved by properly adjusting the directions of the spin measurement even
in a relativistically moving inertial frame.
  Based on this we infer that the entanglement information is preserved under
Lorentz boost as a form of correlation information determined by the
transformation characteristic of the Bell state in use.

starburst of massive (virial temperatures >10^4K) metal-free protogalaxies is
studied. In particular, we focus on the effect of H2 photodissociation by
pre-existing stars on the fragmentation mass scale, presumedly determined by
the Jeans mass at the end of the initial free-fall phase, i.e., at the
so-called ``loitering phase,'' characterized by the local temperature minimum.
Photodissociation diminishes the Jeans mass at the loitering phase, thereby
reducing the fragmentation mass scale of primordial clouds. Thus, in a given
cloud, far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from the first star, which is supposedly
very massive (about 10^3Msun), reduces the mass scale for subsequent
fragmentation. Through a series of similar processes the IMF for metal-free
stars is established. If FUV radiation exceeds a threshold level, the
star-forming clumps collapse solely through atomic cooling. Correspondingly,
the fragmentation scale drops discontinuously from a few time 10Msun to
sub-solar scales. In compact clouds (>1.6kpc for clouds of gas mass 10^8Msun),
this level of radiation field is attained, and sub-solar mass stars are formed
even in a metal-free environment. Consequently, the IMF becomes bi-modal, with
peaks at a few tenths of Msun and a few times 10Msun. The high-mass portion of
the IMF is found to be a very steep function of the stellar mass, xi_high(m)
being proportinal to m^{-5}. Therefore, the typical mass scale of metal-free
stars is significantly smaller than that of the very first stars. Also we study
the thermal instability in collapsing primordial prestellar clumps, and discuss
why the thermal instability occuring during the three-body H2 formation does
not appear to manifest itself in causing further fragmentation of such clumps.

the interior convection zone will penetrate into the stellar envelope, thereby
mixing the envelope with the He- and C-rich core. Such ""flash-mixed"" stars will
arrive on the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) with He- and C-rich surface
compositions and will be hotter than the hottest canonical EHB stars. Two types
of flash mixing are possible: ""deep"" and ""shallow"", depending on whether the

The information derived from high resolution spectra comes from line shapes and
the relative line strengths of closely spaced lines. The values for the stellar

improved accuracy in placing young stellar objects on evolutionary model

calculated as a function of dimensionless accretion rate $\dot{m}$

find that the accretion disks in most BL Lac objects should not be standard
accretion disks. For a pure advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF), there is
an upper limit on its optical continuum luminosity due to the existence of an
upper limit $\dot{m}_{\rm crit}$ on the accretion rate. It is found that a pure
ADAF is too faint to produce the optical ionizing luminosity of BL Lac objects

in the inner region of the disk and it becomes a standard thin disk in the

distribution of counts in cells. The most unique feature of our technique is
that it is applicable to non-linear scales, where both dark matter statistics
and the nature of galaxy bias are fairly complex. First, we estimate the
underlying continuous distribution function from precise counts-in-cells
measurements assuming local Poisson sampling. Then a robust, non-parametric
inversion of the bias function is recovered from the comparison of the
cumulative distributions in simulated dark matter and galaxy catalogs.
Obtaining continuous statistics from the discrete counts is the most delicate
novel part of our recipe. It corresponds to a deconvolution of a (Poisson)
kernel. For this we present two alternatives: a model independent algorithm
based on Richardson-Lucy iteration, and a solution using a parametric skewed
lognormal model. We find that the latter is an excellent approximation for the
dark matter distribution, but the model independent iterative procedure is more
suitable for galaxies. Tests based on high resolution dark matter simulations
and corresponding mock galaxy catalogs show that we can reconstruct the
non-linear bias function down to highly non-linear scales with high precision
in the range of $-1 \le \delta \le 5$. As far as the stochasticity of the bias,
we have found a remarkably simple and accurate formula based on Poisson noise,
which provides an excellent approximation for the scatter around the mean
non-linear bias function. In addition we have found that redshift distortions
have a negligible effect on our bias reconstruction, therefore our recipe can
be safely applied to redshift surveys.

cooling rates by those electrons emitting most of the radiation we see. Blazars
are among the most active sources we know of, and the coordinated variability
at high energies gives very important clues about the physics of their jets:
initially, they must transport energy in a dissipationless way. They radiate
most of the entire bolometric luminosity we see at a preferred distance of a
few hundreds of Schwarzchild radii.For powerful blazars, the emitted radiation
must be a small fraction of the power transported by the jet, since the bulk of
it is required to energize the radio lobes. These are the jets which likely
have bulk relativistic speeds up to hundreds of kiloparsecs, as suggested by

the following three quantities: the fraction of Lyman continuum luminosity
absorbed by gas (f), the fraction of UV luminosity absorbed by dust (epsilon),
and the fraction of dust heating from old (>10^8 yr) stellar populations (eta).
We develop a method to estimate those three quantities based on the idea that
the various way of SFR estimates should return the same SFR. After applying our
method to samples of galaxies, the following results are obtained. First, our
method is applied to star-forming galaxies, finding that f~0.6, epsilon~0.5,
and eta~0.4 as representative values. Next, we apply the method to a starburst
sample, which shows larger extinction than the star-forming galaxy sample. With
the aid of f, epsilon, and eta, we estimate reliable SFRs. Moreover, the
H-alpha luminosity, if the H-alpha extinction is corrected by using the Balmer
decrement, is suitable for a statistical analysis of SFR, because the same
correction factor for the Lyman continuum extinction is applicable to both
normal and starburst galaxies over all the range of SFR. The metallicity
dependence of f and epsilon is also tested: Only the latter proves to have a
correlation with metallicity. As an extension of our result, we show that all
UV, H-alpha, and IR comoving luminosity densities at z=0 give a consistent SFR
(~ 3x10^{-2}h M_sun/Mpc^3). Useful formulae for SFR estimate are listed.

molecular dynamics simulations. To investigate the dynamics we focus on events
(""jumps"") where a particle escapes the cage formed by its neighbors. Using
single particle trajectories we define a jump by comparing for each particle
its fluctuations with its changes in average position. We find two kinds of
jumps: ""reversible jumps,"" where a particle jumps back and forth between two or
more average positions, and ""irreversible jumps,"" where a particle does not
return to any of its former average positions. For all investigated
temperatures both kinds of particles jump and both irreversible and reversible
jumps occur. With increasing temperature relaxation is enhanced by an
increasing number of jumps, and growing jump lengths in position and potential
energy. However, the waiting time between two successive jumps is independent
of temperature. This temperature independence might be due to aging, which is
present in our system. The ratio of irreversible to reversible jumps is also
increasing with increasing temperature, which we interpret as a consequence of
the increased likelihood of changes in the cages, i.e. a blocking of the
""entrance"" back into the previous cage. A comparison of the fluctuations of
jumping particles and non-jumping particles indicates that jumping particles
are more mobile even when not jumping. The jumps in energy normalized by their
fluctuations are decreasing with increasing temperature, which is consistent
with relaxation being increasingly driven by thermal fluctuations. In
accordance with subdiffusive behavior are the distributions of waiting times
and jump lengths in position.

several recent experiments were performed on small systems, one should not
really be surprised that (continuum) elasticity, a macroscopic theory, is not
directly applicable, and should be replaced by a grain-scale (``microscopic'')
description. Such a description concerns the interparticle forces, while a
macroscopic description is given in terms of the stress field. These
descriptions are related, but not equivalent, and the distinction is important
in interpreting the experimental results. There are indications that at least
some large scale properties of granular assemblies can be described by
elasticity, although not necessarily its isotropic version. The purely
repulsive interparticle forces (in non-cohesive materials) may lead to
modifications of the contact network upon the application of external forces,
which may strongly affect the anisotropy of the system. This effect is expected
to be small (in non-isostatic systems) for small applied forces and for
pre-stressed systems (in particular for disordered systems). Otherwise, it may
be accounted for using a nonlinear, incrementally elastic model, with
stress-history dependent elastic moduli. Although many features of the

demonstrating the importance of accounting for friction are presented.

orbital superexchange interactions between $d^1$ ions in an ideal perovskite
structure in which the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals are degenerate in energy and
electron hopping is constrained by cubic site symmetry. In this paper we
implement a variational approach to mean-field theory in which each site, $i$,
has its own $n \times n$ single-site density matrix $\rhov(i)$, where $n$, the
number of allowed single-particle states, is 6 (3 orbital times 2 spin states).
The variational free energy from this 35 parameter density matrix is shown to
exhibit the unusual symmetries noted previously which lead to a
wavevector-dependent susceptibility for spins in $\alpha$ orbitals which is
dispersionless in the $q_\alpha$-direction. Thus, for the cubic KK model
itself, mean-field theory does not provide wavevector `selection', in agreement
with rigorous symmetry arguments. We consider the effect of including various
perturbations. When spin-orbit interactions are introduced, the susceptibility
has dispersion in all directions in ${\bf q}$-space, but the resulting
antiferromagnetic mean-field state is degenerate with respect to global
rotation of the staggered spin, implying that the spin-wave spectrum is
gapless. This possibly surprising conclusion is also consistent with rigorous
symmetry arguments. When next-nearest-neighbor hopping is included, staggered
moments of all orbitals appear, but the sum of these moments is zero, yielding
an exotic state with long-range order without long-range spin order. The effect
of a Hund's rule coupling of sufficient strength is to produce a state with
orbital order.

systems and describes the evidences for a valence charge transfer process in
these compounds. The reviewing of the crystal structures of La1-xPbxMnO3
(x=0.1-0.5), La0.6Sr0.4-xTixMnO3 (x=0.0-0.25) and La1-xSrxCoO3 (x=0.1-0.5) is
also presented. On the basis of testing samples, the distribution of valence
charge has been evaluated which showed the failure of elastic bonding mechanism
on all studied systems and revealed the general deficit of valence charge in
the unit cell. This deficit was not equally localized on all coordination
spheres but proved asymmetrically distributed between the spheres. As the
content of substitution increased, the charge deficit declined systematically
from balanced level, signifying the continuous transfer of valence charge from
the B-O6 to A-O12 spheres. The transfered charge varied from system to system,
depending on the valence deviation of spheres and was not small. The total
valence deviation reached near 2electron/unit cell in the studied systems. The
local deviation may be more larger than this average value. The possible impact
of the limitted accuracy of the available structural data on the bond valence
results has been considered.

gradient. Above a particle-size dependent limit $\Phi_0$, direct microscopic
observations demonstrate jamming and unjamming--conversion of fluid to solid
and vice versa--during flow. We show that such a jamming flow produces a
reduction in colloid concentration $\Phi_{x}$ downstream of the constriction.
We propose that this `self-filtration' effect is the consequence of a
combination of jamming of the particulate part of the system and continuing
flow of the liquid part, i.e. the solvent, through the pores of the jammed
solid. Thus we link the concept of jamming in colloidal and granular media with
a 'two-fluid'-like picture of the flow of concentrated suspensions. Results are
also discussed in the light of Osborne Reynolds' original experiments on

the adsorption properties of sites at the metal cluster surface and those of

band in the IR spectra of the adsorbate whose major property is that its

  The migration of chemisorbed molecules (atoms, ions) and molecules (atoms,
ions) in any excited state over adsorption sites of different type results in
changes in the state of the molecule (atom, ion) since the latter adjusts its
state to the set of levels of another type of site. This can be described
figuratively as a transformation of the type of adsorption site. Thus, a single
type of adsorption site, called next surface effective site (SES), is formed.
The energy of desorption from SES site retains an explicit dependence on the

Grav. 20 (2003) L139. A causal symmetry is a transformation of a Lorentzian
manifold (V,g) which maps every future-directed vector onto a future-directed
vector. We prove that the set of all causal symmetries is not a group under the
usual composition operation but a submonoid of the diffeomorphism group of V.
Therefore, the infinitesimal generating vector fields of causal symmetries
--causal motions-- are associated to local one-parameter groups of
transformations which are causal symmetries only for positive values of the
parameter --one-parameter submonoids of causal symmetries--. The pull-back of
the metric under each causal symmetry results in a new rank-2 future tensor,
and we prove that there is always a set of null directions canonical to the
causal symmetry. As a result of this it makes sense to classify causal
symmetries according to the number of independent canonical null directions.
This classification is maintained at the infinitesimal level where we find the
necessary and sufficient conditions for a vector field to be a causal motion.
They involve the Lie derivatives of the metric tensor and of the canonical null
directions. In addition, we prove a stability property of these equations under
the repeated application of the Lie operator. Monotonicity properties,
constants of motion and conserved currents can be defined or built using casual
motions. Some illustrative examples are presented.

a summation of leading logarithm contributions leads to upper bounds on the
magnitudes of both gauge and scalar-field coupling constants, and suggests the
possibility of an additional phase of spontaneous symmetry breaking
characterized by a scalar-field mass comparable to that of the theory's gauge
boson. For radiatively-broken electroweak symmetry, the all-orders summation of
leading logarithm terms involving the dominant three couplings (quartic
scalar-field, t-quark Yukawa, and QCD) contributing to standard-model radiative
corrections leads to an RG-improved potential characterized by a 216 GeV Higgs
boson mass. Upon incorporation of electroweak gauge couplants we find that the
predicted Higgs mass increases to 218 GeV. The potential is also characterized
by a quartic scalar-field coupling over five times larger than that anticipated
for an equivalent Higgs mass obtained via conventional spontaneous symmetry
breaking, leading to a concomitant enhancement of processes (such as $W^+ W^-
\to ZZ$) sensitive to this coupling. Moreover, if the QCD coupling constant is
taken to be sufficiently strong, the tree potential's local minimum at $\phi =
0$ is shown to be restored for the summation of leading logarithm corrections.
Thus if QCD exhibits a two-phase structure similar to that of $N = 1$
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, the weaker asymptotically-free phase of QCD
may be selected by the large logarithm behaviour of the RG-improved effective
potential for radiatively broken electroweak symmetry.

As one consequence, we see that a sparse polynomial in $\Z/p\Z$ consisting of
$k+1$ monomials can have at most $k$ zeroes. Another consequence is a short

light is a powerful and widespread technique, with the single-beam gradient
trap (also known as optical tweezers) in use for a large number of biological
and other applications.
  The forces and torques acting on a trapped particle result from the transfer
of momentum and angular momentum from the trapping beam to the particle.
  Despite the apparent simplicity of a laser trap, with a single particle in a
single beam, exact calculation of the optical forces and torques acting on
particles is difficult. Calculations can be performed using approximate
methods, but are only applicable within their ranges of validity, such as for
particles much larger than, or much smaller than, the trapping wavelength, and
for spherical isotropic particles.
  This leaves unfortunate gaps, since wavelength-scale particles are of great
practical interest because they are readily and strongly trapped and are used
to probe interesting microscopic and macroscopic phenomena, and non-spherical
or anisotropic particles, biological, crystalline, or other, due to their
frequent occurance in nature, and the possibility of rotating such objects or
controlling or sensing their orientation.
  The systematic application of electromagnetic scattering theory can provide a
general theory of laser trapping, and render results missing from existing
theory. We present here calculations of force and torque on a trapped particle
obtained from this theory and discuss the possible applications, including the
optical measurement of the force and torque.

polarized laser beams or beams with helical phase structure. But it is
difficult to develop high power in such experiments because of overheating and
unwanted axial forces, limiting the achievable rotation rates to a few hertz.
This problem can in principle be overcome by using transparent particles,
transferring angular momentum by a mechanism first observed by Beth in 1936,
when he reported a tiny torque developed in a quartz waveplate due to the
change in polarization of transmitted light. Here we show that an optical
torque can be induced on microscopic birefringent particles of calcite held by
optical tweezers. Depending on the polarization of the incident beam, the
particles either become aligned with the plane of polarization (and thus can be
rotated through specified angles) or spin with constant rotation frequency.
Because these microscopic particles are transparent, they can be held in
three-dimensional optical traps at very high power without heating. We have
observed rotation rates in excess of 350 Hz.

redundancy of its record in the environment. This allows quantum physics to
approximate the situation encountered in the classical world: The information
about a classical system can exist independently from its state. In quantum
theory this is no longer possible: In an isolated quantum system the state and
the information about it are inextricably linked, and any measurement may --
and usually will -- reset that state. However, when the information about the
state of a quantum system is spread throughout the environment, it can be
treated (almost) as in classical physics.

Sometimes known as the ``strength function'' from nuclear spectroscopy
experiments, the shape of the LDOS is directly related to the survivial
probability of unperturbed eigenstates, and has recently been related to the
fidelity decay (or ``Loschmidt echo'') under imperfect motion-reversal. For
quantum systems that can be simulated efficiently on a quantum computer, the
LDOS estimation algorithm enables an exponential speed-up over direct classical
computation.

demonstrate how the entanglement in nonlinear bipartite systems can be
associated with a fixed point bifurcation in the classical dynamics. Using the
example of coupled giant spins we show that when a fixed point undergoes a
supercritical pitchfork bifurcation, the corresponding quantum state - the
ground state - achieves its maximum amount of entanglement near the critical
point. We conjecture that this will be a generic feature of systems whose
classical limit exhibits such a bifurcation.

related to the Holevo capacity and the entanglement of formation [15]. In our
previous note [6] equivalence of these to the additivity of the Holevo capacity
for channels with arbitrary linear constraints was shown. This note is the
development of the previous one in the direction of channels with general
constraints. Introducing input constraints provides greater flexibility in the
treatment of the additivity conjecture. The Holevo capacity of arbitrarily
constrained channel is considered and the characteristic property of an optimal
ensemble for such channel is derived, generalizing the maximal distance
property of Schumacher and Westmoreland (proposition 1). It is shown that the
additivity conjecture for two channels with single linear constraints is
equivalent to the similar conjecture for two arbitrarily constrained channels
and, hence, to an interesting subadditivity property of the $\chi$-function for
the tensor product of these channels (theorem 1). We also propose an
alternative way of proving that the additivity conjecture for any two
unconstrained channels implies strong superadditivity of the entanglement of
formation. The arguments from the convex analysis provide another
characterization of channels for which subadditivity of the $\chi $-function
holds (theorem 3). This characterization and some modification of Shor's
channel extension provide a simple way of proving that global additivity of the
minimum output entropy for unconstrained channels implies global subadditivity
of the $\chi $-function and strong superadditivity of the entanglement of
formation.

harmonically trapped atom, whose internal transitions are $\Lambda$--shaped and
driven at two-photon resonance by a pair of lasers, which cool the
center--of--mass motion. For this configuration, photons are scattered only due
to the mechanical effects of the quantum interaction between light and atom. We
study the spectrum of emission in the final stage of laser--cooling, when the
atomic center-of-mass dynamics is quantum mechanical and the size of the wave
packet is much smaller than the laser wavelength (Lamb--Dicke limit). We use
the spectral decomposition of the Liouville operator of the master equation for
the atomic density matrix and apply second order perturbation theory. We find
that the spectrum of resonance fluorescence is composed by two narrow sidebands
-- the Stokes and anti-Stokes components of the scattered light -- while all
other signals are in general orders of magnitude smaller. For very low
temperatures, however, the Mollow--type inelastic component of the spectrum
becomes visible. This exhibits novel features which allow further insight into
the quantum dynamics of the system. We provide a physical model that interprets
our results and discuss how one can recover temperature and cooling rate of the
atom from the spectrum. The behaviour of the considered system is compared with
the resonance fluorescence of a trapped atom whose internal transition consists
of two-levels.

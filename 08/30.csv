of mass M to host a number of subhalos N, and two-point correlation function of
galaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulations
of the concordance flat LCDM model. The halo samples include both the host
halos and the subhalos, distinct gravitationally-bound halos within the
virialized regions of larger host systems. We find that the first moment of the
HOD, <N>(M), has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and a
power law high-mass tail. The HOD can be described by a Poisson statistics at
high halo masses but becomes sub-Poisson for <N><4. We show that the HOD can be
understood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass M to host a
central galaxy and the probability to host a given number Ns of satellite
galaxies. The former can be approximated by a step-like function, while the
latter can be well approximated by a Poisson distribution, fully specified by
its first moment <Ns>(M). We find that <Ns>~M^b with b~1 for a wide range of
number densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. This
formulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupation
distribution found in simulations. At z=0, the two-point correlation function
(CF) of galactic halos can be well fit by a power law down to ~100/h kpc with
an amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. At redshifts
z>~1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the CF at
small scales. If the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, the
assumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses of
high-redshift clustering is likely to bias the estimates of the correlation
length and slope of the correlation function.

sizable fraction of the observed polarized flux is due to Galactic selective
extinction, while it is not possible to single out any clear contribution from

massive star clusters. Over a mass range from 5E6 to 9E8 solar masses, the
molecular complexes follow a power-law mass function with a slope of -1.4 +/-
0.1, which is very similar to the slope seen at lower masses in molecular
clouds and cloud cores in the Galaxy. Compared to the spiral galaxy M51, which
has a similar surface density and total mass of molecular gas, the Antennae
contain clouds that are an order of magnitude more massive. Many of the
youngest star clusters lie in the gas-rich overlap region, where extinctions as
high as Av~100 imply that the clusters must lie in front of the gas. Combining
data on the young clusters, thermal and nonthermal radio sources, and the
molecular gas suggests that young massive clusters could have formed at a
constant rate in the Antennae over the last 160 Myr and that sufficient gas
exists to sustain this cluster formation rate well into the future. However,
this conclusion requires that a very high fraction of the massive clusters that
form initially in the Antennae do not survive as long as 100 Myr. Finally, we
compare our data with two models for massive star cluster formation and
conclude that the model where young massive star clusters form from dense cores
within the observed super giant molecular complexes is most consistent with our
current understanding of this merging system. (abbreviated)

currently used in published isochrones. We also verify that all current
theoretical models for the lower main sequence (with the exception of Baraffe

mirror adaptive optics system. We utilized the 6.5m MMT AO system to produce
high-resolution (FWHM=0.07'') near infrared (1.6 um) images of the young (~1
Myr) Orion Trapezium theta 1 Ori cluster members. A combination of high spatial
resolution and high signal to noise allowed the positions of these stars to be
measured to within ~0.003'' accuracies. Including previous speckle data
(Weigelt et al. 1999), we analyze a six year baseline of high-resolution
observations of this cluster. Over this baseline we are sensitive to relative
proper motions of only ~0.002''/yr (4.2 km/s at 450 pc). At such sensitivities
we detect orbital motion in the very tight theta 1 Ori B2B3 (52 AU separation)
and theta 1 Ori A1A2 (94 AU separation) systems. Such motions are consistent
with those independently observed by Schertl et al. (2003) with speckle
interferometry, giving us confidence that these very small (~0.002''/yr)
orbital motions are real. All five members of the theta 1 Ori B system appear
likely gravitationally bound. The very lowest mass member of the theta 1 Ori B
system (B4) has K' ~11.66 and an estimated mass of ~0.2 Msun. There was very
little motion (4+/-15 km/s) detected of B4 w.r.t B1 or B2, hence B4 is possibly
part of the theta 1 Ori B group. We suspect that if this very low mass member
is physically associated it most likely is in an unstable (non-hierarchical)
orbital position and will soon be ejected from the group. The theta 1 Ori B
system appears to be a good example of a star formation ``mini-cluster'' which
may eject the lowest mass members of the cluster in the near future. This
``ejection'' process could play a major role in the formation of low mass stars
and brown dwarfs.

substantial overlap in colors and SEDs between protostars embedded in envelopes
(Class 0-I) and T Tauri disks (Class II), especially at mid-IR wavelengths.
Edge-on Class I-II sources show double-peaked spectral energy distributions,
with a short-wavelength hump due to scattered light and the long-wavelength
hump due to thermal emission. These are the bluest sources in mid-IR
color-color diagrams.
  Since Class 0 and I sources are diffuse, the size of the aperture over which
fluxes are integrated has a substantial effect on the computed colors, with
larger aperture results showing significantly bluer colors. This causes overlap
in color-color diagrams between all evolutionary states, especially in the
mid-IR. However the near-IR polarization of the Class 0 sources is much higher
than the Class I-II sources, providing a means to separate these evolutionary
states.
  We varied the grain properties in the circumstellar envelope, allowing for
larger grains in the disk midplane and smaller in the envelope. We find that
grain growth in disks of Class I sources can be detected at wavelengths greater
than 100 $\mu$m.
  Our image calculations predict that the diffuse emission from edge-on Class I

have small $\epsilon$ is actually unnecessary: instead of the original flux
compactification background valid to linear order in $\epsilon$ one has to use
its appropriate non-linear extension, the exact background solution. The exact
background is determined by supersymmetry and consequently one expects the

show that the exact background represents precisely the 11d origin of the 5d

M-theory. We also comment on singularities and the issue of chirality changing
transitions in the exact background. The exact background is then applied to
determine Newton's Constant for vacua with an M5 brane on the basis of a recent
stabilization mechanism for the orbifold length. For vacua without M5 brane we

Since any Galois field is not algebraically closed, in the general case there
is no guarantee that even a Hermitian operator necessarily has eigenvalues. We
assume that the symmetry algebra is the Galois field analog of the de Sitter

Mechanics (NCQM) is showed to be equivalent to Quantum Mechanics (QM) on a
suitable transformed Quantum Phase Space (QPS). Imposing some constraints on
this particular transformation, we firstly find that the product of the two
noncommutativity parameters possesses a lower bound in direct relation with
Heisenberg incertitude relations, and secondly that the two parameters are
equivalent but with opposite sign, up to a dimension factor depending on the
physical system under study. This means that ""noncommutativity"" is represented
by a unique parameter which may play the role of a ""fundamental constant""
characterizing the whole NCQPS. Within our framework, we treat some physical
systems on NCQPS : free particle, harmonic oscillator, system of two-charged
particles, Hydrogen atom. Among the obtained results, we discover a new
phenomenon which consists to see a free particle on NCQPS as equivalent to a
harmonic oscillator with Larmor frequency depending on one noncommutativity
parameter, representing the same particle in the presence of a magnetic field.
For the other examples, additional correction terms appear in the expression of
the energy spectrum. Finally, in the two-particle system case, we emphasize the
fact that for two opposite charges noncommutativity is effectively perceived
with opposite sign.

varieties defined by arithmetic quotients of symmetric domains for O(n,2),
theta functions, values and derivatives of Eisenstein series and values and
derivatives of certain L-functions. In the geometric case, results of joint
work with John Millson imply that the generating functions for the classes in
cohomology of certain algebraic cycles of codimension r are Siegel modular
forms of genus r and weight n/2+1. A result of Borcherds shows that, for r=1,
the same is true for the generating function for the classes of such divisors
in the Chow group. By the Siegel-Weil formula, the generating function for the
volumes of codimension r cycles coincides with a value of a Siegel-Eisenstein
series of genus r. In particular, this gives an interpretation of the Fourier
coefficients of these Eisenstein series as volumes of algebraic cycles. The
second part of the paper discusses the possible analogues of these results in
the arithmetic case, where the special values of derivatives of Eisenstein
series arise. In this case, the Fourier coefficients of such derivatives are
should be the heights (arithmetic volumes) of certain cycles on integral models

relations between central derivatives of certain L-functions and height

Tonghai Yang. First, we construct an modular form \phi(\tau) of weight 3/2
valued in the arithmetic Chow group of the arithmetic surface M attached toa
Shimura curve over Q. The q-expansion of this function is an analogue of the
Hirzebruch-Zagier generating function for the cohomology classes of curves on a
Hilbert modular surface. This`arithmetic theta function' is used to define an
`arithmetic theta lift' from modular forms of weight 3/2 to the arithmetic Chow
group of M. For integers t_1 and t_2 with t_1t_2 not a square, the
(t_1,t_2)-Fourier coefficient of the height pairing <\phi(\tau_1),\phi(\tau_2)>
coincides with the (t_1,t_2)-Fourier coefficient of the restriction to the
diagonal of the central derivative of a certain Eisenstein series of weight 3/2

of weight 3/2, we prove that the arithmetic theta lift of a Hecke eigenform f
is nonzero if and only if there is no local obstruction (theta dichotomy) and
the standard Hecke L-function L(s,F) of the corresponding newform F of weight 2

distinct coordinates and to the subspace of singular vectors of a given weight
in the tensor product of irreducible finite-dimensional sl_2-representations,
[G]. The Bethe equations of this model provide the critical point system of a
remarkable rational symmetric function. Any critical orbit determines a common
eigenvector of the Gaudin hamiltonians called a Bethe vector.
  In [ReV], it was shown that for generic z the Bethe vectors span the space of
singular vectors, i.e. that the number of critical orbits is bounded from below
by the dimension of the space of singular vectors. The upper bound by the same
number is one of the main results of [SV].
  In the present paper we get this upper bound in another, ``less technical'',
way. The crucial observation is that the symmetric function defining the Bethe
equations can be interpreted as the generating function of the map sending a
pair of complex polynomials into their Wronski determinant: the critical orbits
determine the preimage of a given polynomial under this map. Within the
framework of the Schubert calculus, the number of critical orbits can be
estimated by the intersection number of special Schubert classes. Relations to
the sl_2 representation theory [F] imply that this number is the dimension of
the space of singular vectors.
  We prove also that the spectrum of the Gaudin hamiltonians is simple for
generic z.

g-1), uranium (from 8.1x10^-4 to 3.2 micro g g-1) and potassium (from 1.3x10^-4
to 1.9 %). The Arithmetic mean values (A.M. +- S.D.) calculated are (1.2 +-
1.7) micro g g-1, (0.6 +- 0.7) micro g g-1, and (0.4 +- 0.3) %, for thorium,
uranium and potassium, respectively, which are by a factor of three to six
lower than the world average values of 7.4 micro g g-1 (Th), 2.8 micro g g-1
(U) and 1.3 % (K) derived from all data available worldwide. The best-fitting
relation between the concentrations of Th and K versus U, and also of K versus
Th, is essentially of linear type with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, 0.84,
and 0.90, respectively. The Th/U, K/U, and K/Th ratios (slopes) calculated are
equal to 2.0, 2.8x10^3,and 1.4x10^3, respectively.

associated dose rates from the naturally occurring radionuclides Th-232, U-238,
and K-40, in the various geological formations appearing throughout the
geographically accessible area of Cyprus, by means of high-resolution gamma-ray
spectrometry. A total number of 115 representative soil samples were collected
from all over the bedrock surface of the island, based on the different
lithological units of the study area, sieved through a fine mesh, sealed in
1000-mL plastic Marinelli beakers, and measured in the laboratory with respect
to their gamma radioactivity for a counting time of 18 hours each. From the
measured spectra, activity concentrations were determined for Th-232 (range
from 1.0x10^-2 to 39.8 Bq/kg), U-238 (from 1.0x10^-2 to 39.3 Bq/kg) and K-40
(from 4.0x10^-2 to 565.8 Bq/kg). Gamma absorbed dose rates in air outdoors were
calculated to be in the range of 1.1x10^-2 - 51.3 nGy/h, depending on the
geological features, with an overall mean value of 8.7 nGy/h and a standard
deviation of 8.4 nGy/h. This value is by a factor of about 7 below the
corresponding population-weighted world-averaged value of 60 nGy/h reported by
UNSCEAR (2000), and one of the lowest that has been reported from similar
investigations worldwide. Assuming a 20% occupancy factor, the corresponding
effective dose rates outdoors equivalent to the population were calculated to
be between 1.3x10^-2 and 62.9 micro Sv/y, with an arithmetic mean value of 10.7
micro Sv/y and a standard deviation of 10.3 micro Sv/y.

in general. It has been shown, however, that in some cases it can generate
universal quantum computation over a subspace. For example, by encoding logical
qubits into arrays of multiple physical qubits, a single isotropic or
anisotropic exchange interaction can generate a universal logical gate-set.
Recently, encoded universality for the exchange interaction was explicitly
demonstrated on three-qubit arrays, the smallest nontrivial encoding. We now
present the exact specification of a discrete universal logical gate-set on
four-qubit arrays. We show how to implement the single qubit operations exactly
with at most 3 nearest neighbor exchange operations and how to generate the
encoded controlled-not with 29 parallel nearest neighbor exchange interactions
or 54 serial gates, obtained from extensive numerical optimization using
genetic algorithms and Nelder-Mead searches. Our gate-sequences are immediately
applicable to implementations of quantum circuits with the exchange
interaction.

factor and natural frequency. The most general symmetric Gaussian states are
obtained as the one-parameter squeezed states of the pseudo-stationary ground
state. It is further shown that the coherent states of the pseudo-stationary
ground state constitute another class of the generalized minimum uncertainty
states.

investigated using the concurrence measure. For a nondegenerate S=0 ground

function. The concurrence length is seen to be extremely short. A few finite
clusters are studied numerically, to see the trend in higher dimensions. It is
argued that nearest-neighbour concurrence is zero for triangular and Kagome
lattices. The concurrences in the maximal-spin states are explicitly
calculated, where the concurrence averaged over all pairs is larger than the
S=0 states.

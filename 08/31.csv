circumstellar signatures from nearby supernovae has been conducted. Until now,
two Type Ia supernovae have been observed, SNe 2000cx and 2001el. Here we
report on preliminary results for SNe 2001el, and we discuss how the
observations can be used together with detailed modeling to derive an upper
limit on the putative wind from the progenitor system. For a hydrogen-rich wind
with velocity 10 km/s, the mass loss rate for the progenitor system of SN
2001el is less than 1O^{-5} solar masses per year.

have formed very early in history. Several mechanisms for creating and growing
these holes have been proposed. Here we present an evaluation of the timescales
needed for various critical processes in order to discriminate between the
proposed scenarios. We find in particular that mergers alone are not able to
grow the black holes at a sufficient rate. Accretion models offer a solution
and we use accretion timescales to constrain the manner in which the black hole
was first formed. This analysis implies, but does not require, the action of
some unconventional process.

  comments","Astrophys.J.609:363-377,2004","10.1086/421006",,"astro-ph hep-ph nucl-th",,"  We consider a stationary, spherically outflowing wind consisting of
electron-positron pairs and photons. We do not assume thermal equilibrium, and
include the two-body processes that occur in such a wind: Moller and Bhaba
scattering of pairs, Compton scattering, two-photon pair annihilation, and
two-photon pair production, together with their radiative three-body variants:
bremsstrahlung, double Compton scattering, and three-photon pair annihilation,
with their inverse processes. In the concrete example described here, the wind
injection source is a hot, bare, strange star. Such stars are thought to be
powerful sources of pairs created by the Coulomb barrier at the quark surface.
We present a new, finite-difference scheme for solving the relativistic kinetic
Boltzmann equations for pairs and photons. Using this method we study the
kinetics of the wind particles and the emerging emission for total luminosities
of L=10^{34}-10^{42} ergs/s. We find the rates of particle number and energy
outflows, outflow velocities, number densities, energy spectra, and other
parameters for both photons and pairs as functions of the distance. We find
that for L>2x10^{35} ergs/s, photons dominate the emerging emission. As L
increases from ~ 10^{34} to 10^{42} ergs/s, the mean energy of emergent photons
decreases from ~400-500 keV to 40 keV, as the spectrum changes in shape from
that of a wide annihilation line to nearly a blackbody spectrum with a high
energy (> 100 keV) tail. These results are pertinent to the deduction of the
outside appearance of hot bare strange stars, which might help discern them
from neutron stars.

The $<kkk>$ reflections, with $10^{-4}$ of the $<k00>$ magnetic intensities,
cannot be explained on the basis of the primary order parameter within standard

presented including their energy, azimuthal and temperature dependencies. On

between the particles, which is not sufficient for chemically detailed systems
with many-body potentials such as angles and torsions. We introduce a method to
calculate local pressures in systems with n-body interactions (n=2,3,4, . . .)
based on a micromechanical definition of the pressure tensor. The local
pressure consists of a kinetic contribution from the linear momentum of the
particles and an internal contribution from dissected many-body interactions by
infinitesimal areas. To define dissection by a small area, respective n-body
interactions are divided into two geometric centers, effectively reducing them
to two-body interactions. Consistency with hydrodynamics-derived formulas for
systems with two-body interactions (J. H. Irving and J. G. Kirkwood, J. Chem.
Phys. 18, 817 (1950)), for average cross-sectional pressures (B. D. Todd, D. J.
Evans, and P. J. Daivis, Phys. Rev. E 52, 1627 (1995)), and for volume averaged
pressures (virial formula) is shown. As a simple numerical example, we discuss
liquid propane in a cubic box. Local, crosssectional,and volume-averaged
pressures as well as relative contributions from two-body and three-body forces
are analyzed with the proposed method, showing full numerical equivalence with
the existing approaches. The method allows computing local pressures in the

background. From the dual gauge theory point of view the deformation describes
supersymmetry soft breaking gaugino mass terms. We calculate the difference in
vacuum energies between the supersymmetric and the non-supersymmetric solutions
and find that it matches the field theory prediction. We also discuss the
breaking of the $U(1)_R$ symmetry and the space-time dependence of the gaugino
bilinears two point function. Finally, we determine the Penrose limit of the
non-supersymmetric background and write down the corresponding plane wave
string theory. This string describes ``annulons''-heavy hadrons with mass
proportional to large global charge. Surprisingly the string spectrum has two
fermionic zero modes. This implies that the sector in the non-supersymmetric
gauge theory which is the dual of the annulons is supersymmetric.

influence of this term has been numerically investigated considering the

based on time reversal invariance on a quantum optical Ramsey fringes
experiment, where a realization of complementarity for atomic coherence can be
achieved. It consists of two high finesse resonators that are pumped and probed
by the same atom. This property relates quantum erasing with time reversal
symmetry, allowing for a full quantum erasing of the which-way information
stored in the cavity fields. The outlined scheme also prepares and observes a
non-local state in the fields of the resonators: a coherent superposition
between correlated states of macroscopically separated quantum systems. The
proposed scheme emphasizes the role of entanglement swapping in delayed-choice
experiments. Finally, we show that the quantum self-eraser violates temporal
Bell inequalities and analyze the relation between this violation and the
erasability of which-way information.

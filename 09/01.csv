an estimate of the density of the warm gas of ~50 f_baryon rho_critical, where
f_baryon is the baryon fraction of the gas and rho_critical is the critical
density needed to halt the expansion of the universe. Our measurement of the
gas mass associated with the warm emission strongly support its nonvirialized
nature, suggesting that we are observing the warm-hot intergalactic medium

abundance of the WHIM. Differences with the reported Ne/O ratio for some OVI
absorbers hints at a different origin of the OVI absorbers and the Coma

substantially lower level compared to what is seen in the outskirts of groups.
The thermodynamic state of the gas in the Coma filament reduces the
star-formation rate in the embedded spiral galaxies, providing an explanation
for the presence of passive spirals observed in this and other clusters.

pressures, typical of galaxy clusters, or mild ram pressure due to the gas halo

considering flattened, rotating dwarf galaxies subject to ram pressures typical
of poor galaxy groups.
  We study the ram pressure effects as a function of several parameters such as
galactic mass and velocity, ambient gas density, and angle between the galactic
plane and the direction of motion. It turns out that this latter parameter
plays a role only when the gas pressure in the galactic centre is comparable to
the ram pressure. Despite the low values of the ram pressure, some dwarf
galaxies can be completely stripped after 1-2 hundred of million years. This
pose an interesting question on the aspect of the descents and, more in
general, on the morphological evolution of dwarf galaxies. In cases in which
the gas is not completely stripped, the propagation of possible galactic wind
may be influenced by the disturbed distribution of the interstellar matter.
  We also consider the modification of the ISM surface density induced by the
ram pessure and find that the resulting compression may trigger star formation
over long time spans.

with being in their Sedov evolutionary phase. IKT 6 and IKT 23 both have a

derive estimates for physical parameters, such as densities, ages, masses and

qualitative considerations to estimate the order of magnitude of the tidal
force and the frequency range covered by the tidally induced oscillations. The
investigation is valid for slowly rotating stars with masses in the interval
between 2 and 20 solar masses, and an evolutionary stage ranging from the
beginning to the end of the main sequence. Oscillation modes with
eigenfrequencies of the order of five times the inverse of the star's dynamical
time scale - i.e. the lowest-order p-modes, the f-mode, and the lowest-order
g-modes - are found to be outside the favourable parameter space since their
resonant excitation requires orbital eccentricities that are too high for the
binary to stay detached when the components pass through the periastron of
their relative orbit. Resonances between dynamic tides and g-modes with
frequencies of the order of half of the inverse of the star's dynamical time
scale on the other hand are found to be favourable for orbital periods up to
200 times the star's dynamical time scale, provided that the binary mass ratio
q is larger than 1/3 and the orbital eccentricity e is larger than

the cosmic shear signal are the shear correlation functions; these can be
directly calculated from data, and compared with theoretical expectations for
different cosmological models and matter power spectra. We present a Monte
Carlo method to quickly simulate mock cosmic shear surveys. One application of
this method is in the determination of the full covariance matrix for the
correlation functions; this includes redshift binning and is applicable to
arbitrary survey geometries. Terms arising from shot noise and cosmic variance
(dominant on small and large scales respectively) are accounted for naturally.
As an illustration of the use of such covariance matrices, we consider to what

employed. The parameters considered are those commonly discussed in cosmic

  Patterns Features","19 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  It is shown that the branch of the empirical fundamental diagram for
congested traffic strongly depends both on the type of the congested pattern at
a freeway bottleneck and on the freeway location where the fundamental diagram
is measured. Since the type of the pattern at the same bottleneck can depend on
traffic demand, a qualitative form of the empirical fundamental diagram can
strong depend on traffic demand also. At freeway locations where the average
speed in synchronized flow is higher the branch of the fundamental diagram for
congested traffic has a positive slope in the flow density plane as well the
slope of the branch for free flow. In the upstream direction when the average
synchronized flow speed inside the congested pattern decreases, first the slope
of the branch for congested traffic decreases and then the branch can transform
into the curve with a maximum. At freeway locations, where the average speed in
synchronized flow further decreases the branch for congested traffic more and
more tends to the line J which represents the stationary motion of the
downstream front of a wide moving jam in the flow-density plane: The line J is
an asymptote for the branch of congested traffic of the empirical fundamental
diagrams at higher densities for those freeway locations where wide moving jams
occur and propagate.

Lennard-Jones liquid confined between two parallel rough walls. These walls are
realized by frozen amorphous configurations of the same liquid and therefore
the structural properties of the confined fluid are identical to the ones of
the bulk system. Hence this setup allows us to study how the relaxation
dynamics is affected by the pure effect of confinement, i.e. if structural
changes are completely avoided. We find that the local relaxation dynamics is a
strong function of z, the distance of the particles from the wall, and that
close to the surface the typical relaxation times are orders of magnitude
larger than the ones in the bulk. Because of the cooperative nature of the
particle dynamics, the slow dynamics also affects the dynamics of the particles
for large values of z. Using various empirical laws, we are able to
parameterize accurately the z-dependence of the generalized incoherent
intermediate scattering function F_s(q,z,t) and also the spatial dependence of
structural relaxation times. These laws allow us to determine various dynamical
length scales and we find that their temperature dependence is compatible with
an Arrhenius law. Furthermore, we find that at low temperatures time and space
dependent correlation function fulfill a generalized factorization property
similar to the one predicted by mode-coupling theory for bulk systems. For thin
films and/or at sufficiently low temperatures, we find that the relaxation
dynamics is influenced by the two walls in a strongly non-linear way in that
the slowing down is much stronger than the one expected from the presence of

finite-size scaling properties in two different ensembles for the disorder (i)
the canonical ensemble, where the disorder variables are independent (ii) the
microcanonical ensemble, where there exists a global constraint on the disorder
variables. The observables under study are the surface magnetization, the
correlation of the two surface magnetizations, the gap and the end-to-end
spin-spin correlation $C(L)$ for a chain of length $L$. At criticality, each
observable decays typically as $e^{- w \sqrt{L}}$ in both ensembles, but the
probability distributions of the rescaled variable $w$ are different in the two
ensembles, in particular in their asymptotic behaviors. As a consequence, the
dependence in $L$ of averaged observables differ in the two ensembles. For
instance, the correlation $C(L)$ decays algebraically as 1/L in the canonical
ensemble, but sub-exponentially as $e^{-c L^{1/3}}$ in the microcanonical
ensemble. Off criticality, probability distributions of rescaled variables are
governed by the critical exponent $\nu=2$ in both ensembles, but the following
observables are governed by the exponent $\tilde \nu=1$ in the microcanonical
ensemble, instead of the exponent $\nu=2$ in the canonical ensemble (a) in the
disordered phase : the averaged surface magnetization, the averaged correlation
of the two surface magnetizations and the averaged end-to-end spin-spin

very sensitive to the microcanonical constraint.

sometimes accompanied by a dielectric peak, that we relate to lattice
stiffness, to structural and energetic disorder, and to the softening of the

  and Practice of Logic Programming""",,,,"cs.PL cs.SC",,"  The overall goal of this paper is to investigate the theoretical foundations
of algorithmic verification techniques for first order linear logic
specifications. The fragment of linear logic we consider in this paper is based
on the linear logic programming language called LO enriched with universally
quantified goal formulas. Although LO was originally introduced as a
theoretical foundation for extensions of logic programming languages, it can
also be viewed as a very general language to specify a wide range of
infinite-state concurrent systems.
  Our approach is based on the relation between backward reachability and
provability highlighted in our previous work on propositional LO programs.
Following this line of research, we define here a general framework for the
bottom-up evaluation of first order linear logic specifications. The evaluation
procedure is based on an effective fixpoint operator working on a symbolic
representation of infinite collections of first order linear logic formulas.
The theory of well quasi-orderings can be used to provide sufficient conditions
for the termination of the evaluation of non trivial fragments of first order
linear logic.

of the ``clash of symmetries'' mechanism developed by Davidson, Toner, Volkas
and Wali and, independently, by Pogosian and Vachaspati. We show that kink
configurations employing Higgs fields in the 45 (the adjoint representation) of
O(10) break up into three classes: those that at finite distances from the wall
respect a U(5) subgroup of SO(10), and two others that respect the smaller
subgroups U(3) x U(2) and U(4) x U(1). These smaller subgroups arise from the
clash of symmetries mechanism: they are the intersections of two differently
embedded U(5) subgroups of SO(10), the latter being the symmetries respected in
asymptotia on opposite sides of the domain wall. The existence of the SO(10) ->
U(3) x U(2) = SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) x U(1)' = G_{SM} x U(1)' class advances the
search for a realistic brane world model wherein some of the required symmetry
breaking is achieved via the clash of symmetries rather than the conventional
mechanism. At the centres of the walls, the unbroken symmetries are enhanced.
In the U(3) x U(2) case, the symmetry is O(6) x U(2), which is closely related
to the Pati-Salam-like SU(4) x SU(2) x U(1) group. If our universe is a brane
located at the centre of such a wall, then we see the O(10) symmetry as being
strongly broken to SU(4) x SU(2) x U(1). Interestingly, if the brane-world
degrees of freedom enjoy a slight leakage off the wall, then an additional
symmetry breakdown to U(3) x U(2) = G_{SM} x U(1)' is effectively induced on
the brane. This provides a possible framework within which to address at least
part of a gauge hierarchy problem: O(10) is strongly broken to SU(4) x SU(2) x
U(1), then more weakly to G_{SM} x U(1)' depending on the amount of leakage off
the brane. We also comment on kinks employing the 10 and 54 of O(10).

K rates, R_c and R_n, respectively, points towards a puzzling picture. Since
these observables are affected significantly by colour-allowed electroweak (EW)
penguins, this ``B -> pi K puzzle'' could be a manifestation of new physics in
the EW penguin sector. Performing the analysis in the R_n-R_c plane, which is
very suitable for monitoring various effects, we demonstrate that we may, in
fact, move straightforwardly to the experimental region in this plane through
an enhancement of the relevant EW penguin parameter q. We derive analytical
bounds for q in terms of a quantity L, that measures the violation of the
Lipkin sum rule, and point out that strong phases around 90 deg are favoured by
the data, in contrast to QCD factorisation. The B -> pi K modes imply a
correlation between q and the angle gamma that in the limit of negligible
rescattering effects and colour suppressed EW penguins depends only on the
value of L. Concentrating on a minimal flavour-violating new-physics scenario
with enhanced Z^0 penguins, we find that the current experimental values on
  B -> X_s mu^+ mu^- require roughly L <= 1.8. As the B -> pi K data give L =
5.7 +- 2.4, L has either to move to smaller values once the B -> pi K data
improve or new sources of flavour and CP violation are needed. In turn, the
enhanced values of L seen in the B -> pi K data could be accompanied by
enhanced branching ratios for rare decays. Most interesting turns out to be the
correlation between the B -> pi K modes and BR(K^+ -> pi^+ nu nu), with the
latter depending approximately on a single ``scaling'' variable \bar L= L
(|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|/0.086)^2.3.

orbifold branes. Assuming that the inflating branes are stabilized (by the
brane scalar field potentials), we estimate the lowest eigenvalue of the scalar
fluctuations - the radion mass. In the limit of flat branes, we reproduce well
known estimates of the positive radion mass for stabilized branes.
Surprisingly, however, we found that for de Sitter (inflating) branes the
square of the radion mass is typically negative, which leads to a strong
tachyonic instability. Thus, parameters of stabilized inflating braneworlds
must be constrained to avoid this tachyonic instability. Instability of
""stabilized"" de Sitter branes is confirmed by the BraneCode numerical
calculations in the accompanying paper hep-th/0309001. If the model's

defined by Gualtieri and Hitchin (we call these ``generalized Lagrangian

submanifolds. For generalized complex manifolds that arise from complex (resp.,
symplectic) manifolds, all three classes specialize to complex (resp.,
symplectic) submanifolds. In general, however, all three classes are distinct.
We discuss some interesting features of our theory of submanifolds, and
illustrate them with a few nontrivial examples.
  We then support our ``symplectic/Lagrangian viewpoint'' on the submanifolds
introduced by Gualtieri and Hitchin by defining the ``generalized complex
category'', modelled on the constructions of Guillemin-Sternberg and Weinstein.
We argue that our approach may be useful for the quantization of generalized
complex manifolds.

plasma turbulence simulations are investigated using probability density
distribution functions (PDF). The physics included in the models ranges from
two dimensional drift-wave turbulence to three dimensional MHD simulations. The
PDFs of the flux surface averaged transport are in good agreement with an
extreme value distribution (EVD). This is interpreted as a signature of
localized vortical structures dominating the transport on a flux surface.
Models accounting for a local input of energy and including the global
evolution of background profiles show a more bursty behavior in 2D as well as
3D simulations of interchange and drift type turbulence. Although the PDFs are
not Gaussian, again no algebraic tails are observed. The tails are, in all
cases considered, in excellent agreement with EVDs.

described by a unitary transformation generated by a time dependent
Hamiltonian. The inverse problem of finding the field that generates a specific
unitary transformation is the subject of study. The unitary transformation
which can represent an algorithm in a quantum computation is imposed on a
subset of quantum states embedded in a larger Hilbert space. Optimal control
theory (OCT) is used to solve the inversion problem irrespective of the initial
input state. A unified formalism, based on the Krotov method is developed
leading to a new scheme. The schemes are compared for the inversion of a
two-qubit Fourier transform using as registers the vibrational levels of the
$X^1\Sigma^+_g$ electronic state of Na$_2$. Raman-like transitions through the
$A^1\Sigma^+_u$ electronic state induce the transitions. Light fields are found
that are able to implement the Fourier transform within a picosecond time
scale. Such fields can be obtained by pulse-shaping techniques of a femtosecond
pulse. Out of the schemes studied the square modulus scheme converges fastest.
A study of the implementation of the $Q$ qubit Fourier transform in the Na$_2$
molecule was carried out for up to 5 qubits. The classical computation effort
required to obtain the algorithm with a given fidelity is estimated to scale
exponentially with the number of levels. The observed moderate scaling of the
pulse intensity with the number of qubits in the transformation is
rationalized.

discrete time. As a demonstration of this concept we consider particle
scattering on a screen with a slit. We study how resulting interference picture
depends on the parameters of the model. The resulting interference picture has
a nontrivial minimum-maximum distribution which vanishes, as the time
discreteness parameter goes to zero. This picture is qualitatively the same as
one obtained in quantum experiments. The picture includes some interesting
nonclassical properties such as a 'black' region behind the center of the slit.

optical loss to the entangled state, and demonstrate qualitative differences in
the response of the degrees of inseparability and EPR paradox to this loss. The
entanglement is represented on a photon number diagram that provides an
intuitive and physically relevant description of the state. We calculate
efficacy contours for several quantum information protocols on this diagram,
and use them to predict the effectiveness of our entanglement in those
protocols.

despite the Kochen-Specker theorem, simulate the predictions of quantum
mechanics to within any fixed finite experimental precision. Clifton and Kent
have presented constructions of non-contextual hidden variable theories which,
they argued, indeed simulate quantum mechanics in this way. These arguments
have evoked some controversy. One aim of this paper is to respond to and rebut
criticisms of the MCK papers. We thus elaborate in a little more detail how the
CK models can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics to arbitrary
precision. We analyse in more detail the relationship between classicality,
finite precision measurement and contextuality, and defend the claims that the
CK models are both essentially classical and non-contextual. We also examine in
more detail the senses in which a theory can be said to be contextual or
non-contextual, and in which an experiment can be said to provide evidence on
the point. In particular, we criticise the suggestion that a decisive
experimental verification of contextuality is possible, arguing that the idea
rests on a conceptual confusion.

performance of some quantum computation tasks. However such performance
enhancement is possible only if quantum correlations survive the cloning
process. We investigate preservation of the quantum correlations in the process
of non--local cloning of entangled pairs of two--level systems. We consider
different kinds of quantum cloning machines and compare their effectiveness in
the cloning of non--maximally entangled pure states. A mean entanglement is
introduced in order to obtain a quantitative evaluation of an average
efficiency for the different cloning machines. We show that a reduction of the
quantum correlations is significant and it strongly depends upon the kind of
cloning machine used. Losses of the entanglement are largest in the case of the
universal quantum cloning machine. Generally, in all cases considered the
losses of the entanglement are so drastic that the method of enhancement for
the performance of the quantum computation using the quantum cloning seems to
be questionable.

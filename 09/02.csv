proton-proton and proton-air inelastic cross-sections and values for the

CORSIKA simulation program, the impact of these changes is investigated on air
shower observables like the average depth of the shower maximum X_max and the
number of muons and electrons at ground level. Calculating the mean logarithmic
mass from experimental X_max values, it is found that a moderate logarithmic
increase of the proton-proton inelastic cross-section from sigma_pp^inel=51 mb
at E_0=10^6 GeV to sigma_pp^inel=64 mb at E_0=10^8 GeV and an elasticity,
additionally increased by 10% to 15%, describes the data best. Using these
parameters, the mean logarithmic mass lna derived from X_max measurements is
compatible with the extrapolations of the results of direct measurements to
high energies using the poly-gonato model.

Special emphasis was put on the importance of an accurate astrometry which has
a major impact on the interpretation of the data. In the case of G9.62+0.19, we
clarified the true nature of the infrared emission in the immediate vicinity of

(ULXs). These must distinguish between thermal-timescale mass transfer on to
stellar-mass black holes leading to anisotropic X-ray emission, and accretion
on to intermediate-mass black holes. We suggest that long-term transient
behavior via the thermal-viscous disk instability could discriminate between
these two possibilities for ULXs in regions of young stellar populations.
Thermal-timescale mass transfer generally produces stable disks and persistent
X-ray emission. In contrast, mass transfer from massive stars to black holes
produces unstable disks and thus transient behavior, provided that the black
hole mass exceeds some minimum value. This minimum mass depends primarily on
the donor mass and evolutionary state. We show that it exceeds 50 solar masses
for a large fraction (greater than 90%) of the mass-transfer lifetime for the
most likely donors in young clusters. Thus if long-term monitoring reveals a
large transient fraction among ULXs in a young stellar population, these
systems would be good candidates for intermediate-mass black holes in a
statistical sense; information about the donor star is needed to make this
identification secure in any individual case. A transient ULX population would
imply a much larger population of quiescent systems of the same type.

is an extensive early-type galaxy population surrounding a central pair of

defines a tight sequence in the CM diagram, with an intrinsic scatter in

conclude that the slope and scatter in the CM relation for morphologically

considered a special case of the more general family of models in which the
disk is imbedded in an optically thin halo. In the absence of such halo, flux
measurements can never rule out its existence because the disk flaring surface
defines a mathematically equivalent halo that produces the exact same flux at
all IR wavelengths. When a flared disk with height H at its outer radius R is
imbedded in a halo whose optical depth at visual wavelengths is \tau\sub{halo},
the system IR flux is dominated by the halo whenever \tau\sub{halo} > (1/4)H/R.
Even when its optical depth is much smaller, the halo can still have a
significant effect on the disk temperature profile. Imaging is the only way to
rule out the existence of a potential halo, and we identify a decisive test
that extracts a signature unique to flared disks from imaging observations.

Space Telescope images taken with the new Advanced Camera for Surveys. Through
an analysis of concentrations (C), asymmetries (A) and clumpiness values (S)
(CAS) of galaxies found in the GOODS Field South, we are able to identify
objects possibly forming onto the Hubble sequence. Using this approach, we
detect a sizeable population of star forming luminous diffuse objects and star
forming luminous asymmetric objects between redshifts 0.5 < z < 2. These
galaxies have extremely low light concentrations, or high asymmetries, with
absolute magnitudes M_B < -19. The luminous diffuse objects are found in
abundance between z = 1 - 2, with fewer objects at z > 2 and z < 1. The
luminous asymmetric objects are found at a similar abundance, with a peak at
z~1. We argue that these galaxies are a subset of modern disks and ellipticals
in formation. The co-moving volume density of the luminous diffuse objects
between z = 1 - 2 is similar to the local density of bright disk galaxies, with
values ~5*10^{5} Gpc^{-3}. The SEDs of these objects are mostly consistent with
starbursts, or star-forming normal galaxies, with average uncorrected for
extinction star formation rates of ~4 M_0 yr^{-1}. These galaxies also host
35-40% of the star formation activity at 1 < z < 2. We briefly discuss the
implications of these objects for understanding the origin of the Hubble

The concentration indices of the CDFS counterparts are clearly larger on

strong correlation between central black hole mass and host galaxy properties

frequency of I<23 near neighbors around the CDFS counterparts is not
significantly different from the field sample. These results, combined with
previous similar findings for local samples, suggest that recent merger/

J1118+480, which we observed with UKIRT, HST, RXTE, EUVE and many other
instruments and facilities. Adding radio (Ryle Telescope, VLA), sub-millimeter
(JCMT) and X-ray (Chandra and SAX) data from the literature, we assembled the
most complete spectral energy distribution (SED) of this source yet published.
We followed the evolution of this source for 1 year, including 6 observations
performed during the outburst, and one observation at the end of the outburst.
Because of XTE J1118+480's unusually high galactic latitude, it suffers from
very low extinction, and its SED is near-complete, including EUV (Extreme
Ultraviolet) observations. XTE J1118+480 exhibits an unusually low low-hard
state (estimated inner radius 350Rs) and a strong non-thermal contribution in
the radio to optical domain, which is likely to be due to synchrotron emission.
We discuss the interstellar column density and show that it is low, between
0.80 and 1.30 x 10^20 cm-2. We analyse the evolution of the SED during the
outburst, including the contributions from the companion star, the accretion
disc, the outflow, and relating irradiation and variability of the source in
different bands to the SED. We find no significant spectral variability during
the outburst evolution, consistent with the presence of a steady outflow.
Analysis of its outflow to accretion energy ratio suggests that the microquasar
XTE J1118+480 is analogous to radio-quiet quasars. This, combined with the
inverted spectrum from radio to optical, makes XTE J1118+480 very similar to
other microquasar sources, e.g. GRS 1915+105 and GX 339-4 in their low/hard
state. We model the high-energy emission with a hot disc model, and discuss
different accretion models for XTE J1118+480's broad band spectrum.

optically thin and have an excitation temperature of ~30 K. CO is subthermally

we use numerical simulations to show that if CNT based

current will be reduced, and the scaling limit imposed by source-drain

materials. These fluctuations are the basis of many thermodynamic and
hydrodynamic models which aim to provide a statistical description of granular
systems. We present experimental results on diffusivity in dense, granular
shear in a 2D Couette geometry. We find that self-diffusivities are
proportional to the local shear rate with diffusivities along the mean flow
approximately twice as large as those in the perpendicular direction. The
magnitude of the diffusivity is D \approx \dot\gamma a^2 where a is the
particle radius. However, the gradient in shear rate, coupling to the mean
flow, and drag at the moving boundary lead to particle displacements that can
appear sub- or super-diffusive. In particular, diffusion appears superdiffusive
along the mean flow direction due to Taylor dispersion effects and subdiffusive
along the perpendicular direction due to the gradient in shear rate. The
anisotropic force network leads to an additional anisotropy in the diffusivity
that is a property of dense systems with no obvious analog in rapid flows.
Specifically, the diffusivity is supressed along the direction of the strong
force network. A simple random walk simulation reproduces the key features of
the data, such as the apparent superdiffusive and subdiffusive behavior arising
from the mean flow, confirming the underlying diffusive motion. The additional
anisotropy is not observed in the simulation since the strong force network is
not included. Examples of correlated motion, such as transient vortices, and
Levy flights are also observed. Although correlated motion creates velocity
fields qualitatively different from Brownian motion and can introduce
non-diffusive effects, on average the system appears simply diffusive.

designed to solve the dynamical equations numerically. We applied the BraneCode
to braneworld models and found several novel phenomena of the brane dynamics.
Starting with static warped geometry with de Sitter branes, we found
numerically that this configuration is often unstable due to a tachyonic mass
of the radion during inflation. If the model admits other static configurations
with lower values of de Sitter curvature, this effect causes a violent
re-structuring towards them, flattening the branes, which appears as a lowering
of the 4d effective cosmological constant. Braneworld dynamics can often lead
to brane collisions. We found that in the presence of the bulk scalar field,
the 5d geometry between colliding branes approaches a universal, homogeneous,
anisotropic strong gravity Kasner-like asymptotic, irrespective of the
bulk/brane potentials. The Kasner indices of the brane directions are equal to
each other but different from that of the extra dimension.

close to the exact values, to make optimal choices of phi_max. For perturbative

in order to obtain the exact result. For perturbative series terminated at odd

observed should extend to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. We found
that optimization at even order is more efficient that at odd order. We compare
our methods with the linear delta-expansion (LDE) (combined with the principle
of minimal sensitivity) which provides an upper envelope of for the accuracy
curves of various Pade and Pade-Borel approximants. Our optimization method
performs better than the LDE at strong and intermediate coupling, but not at
weak coupling where it appears less robust and subject to further improvements.
We also show that it is possible to fix the arbitrary parameter appearing in
the LDE using the strong coupling expansion, in order to get accuracies
comparable to ours.

provided, and the results are compared to those proposed by Gibbs for open
systems. The Kelvin-Clausius statement concerning heat transfer for reversible
cycles is taken as an axiom, from which several rigorous theorems are proven.An
equation is derived that resembles a Gibbs-Duhem relation relating convected
entropies, from which two distinguishable forms of entropy are proven to exist
for such systems, which questions prevailing developments which presume a
singular or characteristic entropic form which couple all work and heat flows,
such as in Onsager first order thermodynamics. In particular, a closed path
undergone by the system does not return to the environment to the initial state
for one of these entropic forms. The Biot assertion that the entropy
contribution due to diathermal heat transfer does not form a state function is
therefore contradicted and a local entropy is shown to exist. Several other new
composite state functions for work and heat flow are shown to exist for open
systems. From Gibbs' results, it is suggested that the ensuing chemical
potentials used routinely may possibly ignore heat effects. The functions
developed here are suitable for application since the functions are proven to
exist, rather than presumed to exist.

with acoustic phonons. For large tunneling rates between the quantum dots, the
main contribution to decoherence comes from the phonon emission relaxation
processes, while for small tunneling rates, the virtual-phonon, dephasing
processes dominate. Our results show that in common semiconductors, such as Si
and GaAs, the latter mechanism determines the upper limit for the double-dot
charge qubit performance measure.

observable may yield negative values for coherent states. This result cannot be
reproduced by a classical theory where quadratures are stochastic $c$-numbers.
The real part of the weak value is a conditional moment of the Margenau-Hill
distribution. The nonclassicality of coherent states can be associated with
negative values of the Margenau-Hill distribution. A more general type of weak
measurement is considered, where the pointer can be in an arbitrary state, pure
or mixed.

model are discussed. The adiabatic processes are assumed to consist in the slow
variation of the strength of the magnetic field that environs the spin-systems.
These processes are of current interest in the treatment of cold atoms in
optical lattices and in Adiabatic Quantum Computation. We determine the
probability that, during an adiabatic passage starting from the ground state,
states with higher energy are excited.

the single-mode superradiance model, involving the interaction of a boson mode
and an ensemble of atoms. For infinite system size, the atom-field entanglement
of formation diverges logarithmically with the correlation length exponent.
Using a continuous variable representation, we compare this to the divergence
of the entropy in conformal field theories, and derive an exact expression for
the scaled concurrence and the cusp-like non-analyticity of the momentum
squeezing.

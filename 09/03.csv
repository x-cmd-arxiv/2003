Sagittae stars although no O VI emission has been reported. The Temporal
Variance Spectrum - TVS - analysis of our data shows weak but strongly variable
emission of O VI lines which is below the noise level in the intensity
spectrum. Contrary to what is seen in V Sagittae stars, optical photometric
monitoring shows very little, if any, flickering. We found evidence of periodic
variability. The most likely photometric period is P(phot) = 0.227(14) d, while
radial velocities suggest a period of P(spec) = 0.204(13) d. One-day aliases of
these periods can not be ruled out. We call attention to similarities with HD
45166 and DI Cru (= WR 46), where multiple periods are present. They may be
associated to the binary motion or to non-radial oscillations. In contrast to a
previous conclusion by Pereira et al. (1998), we show that WR 7a contains
hydrogen. The spectrum of the primary star seems to be detectable as the N V
4604A absorption line is visible. If so, it means that the wind is optically
thin in the continuum and that it is likely to be a helium main sequence star.
Given the similarity to HD 45166, we suggests that WR 7a may be a qWR - quasi
Wolf-Rayet - star. Its classification is WN4h/CE in the Smith et al. (1996)
three dimensional classification system.

attempt to discriminate between the classical view of galaxy formation, in
which present-day luminous galaxies were assembled at early times and evolve
due to the passive aging of their stellar populations, and that of hierarchical
structure formation, in which galaxies were assembled more recently via the
merging of smaller objects. We carry out such a test here, by computing the
distribution of photometric redshifts of K_AB<22 galaxies in the Great
Observatories Origins Deep Field Survey GOODS Southern Field, and comparing the
results with predictions from a semi-analytic model based on hierarchical
structure formation, and a classical `passive evolution' model. We find that
the redshift distributions at z <~ 1.5 of both the hierarchical and passive
models are very similar to the observed one. At z>~1.5, the hierarchical model
shows a deficit of galaxies, while the passive model predicts an excess. We
investigate the nature of the observed galaxies in the redshift range where the
models diverge, and find that the majority have highly disturbed morphologies,
suggesting that they may be merger-induced starbursts. While the hierarchical
model used here does not produce these objects in great enough numbers, the
appearance of this population is clearly in better qualitative agreement with
the hierarchical picture than with the classical passive evolution scenario. We
conclude that the observations support the general framework of hierarchical
formation, but suggest the need for new or modified physics in the models.

for one-point statistics (i.e. number densities) for typical scales and volumes

approaches: for objects with a known two-point correlation function that is
well-approximated by a power law, one can use the standard analytic formalism
to calculate the cosmic variance (in excess of shot noise). We use this
approach to estimate the cosmic variance for several populations that are being
studied in the GOODS program: Extremely Red Objects (ERO) at z~1, and Lyman
Break Galaxies (LBG) at z~3 and z~4, using clustering information for similar
populations in the literature. For populations with unknown clustering, one can
use predictions from Cold Dark Matter theory to obtain a rough estimate of the
variance as a function of number density. We present a convenient plot which
allows one to use this approach to read off the cosmic variance for a
population with a known mean redshift and estimated number density. We conclude
that for the volumes sampled by GOODS, cosmic variance is a significant source
of uncertainty for strongly clustered objects (~40-60% for EROs) and less
serious for less clustered objects, ~10-20% for LBGs.

the unique radio source Sgr A*. While in 2002 this source (SgrA*-IR) was

by 87 mas allowing the new source's properties to be determined directly. On

corresponds to a flux density of 0.7 - 3 mJy, observed, and 4 - 17 mJy,
dereddened; no other source in this region shows such large variations in flux
density - a factor of 4 over a week and a factor of 2 over 40 min. In addition,

for Surveys (ACS) Early Release Observation fields VV 29 (UGC 10214) and NGC
4676. Here we attempt to thoroughly consider all aspects relevant for faint
galaxy counting and photometry, developing methods which are based on public
software and that are easily reproducible by other astronomers. Using
simulations we determine the best SExtractor parameters for the detection of
faint galaxies in deep HST observations, paying special attention to the issue
of deblending, which significantly affects the normalization and shape of the
number count distribution. We confirm, as claimed by Bernstein, Freedman and
Madore (2002), that Kron-like magnitudes, such as the ones generated by
SExtractor, can miss more than half of the light of faint galaxies, what
dramatically affects the slope of the number counts. We present catalogs for
the VV 29 and NGC 4676 fields with photometry in the g,V and I bands. We also
show that combining the bayesian software BPZ with superb ACS data and new
spectral templates enables us to estimate reliable photometric redshifts for a
significant fraction of galaxies with as few as three filters. After correcting
for selection effects, we measure slopes of 0.32+- 0.01 for 22 < g < 28,
0.34+-0.01 for 22< V <27.5 and 0.33+-0.01 for 22 < I < 27. The counts do not
flatten (except perhaps in the g-band), up to the depth of our observations. We
find that the faint counts m_{AB}> 25.5 can be well approximated in all our
filters by a passive luminosity evolution model based on the COMBO-17
luminosity function (\alpha=-1.5), with a strong merging rate following the
prescription of Glazebrook et al. (1994), \phi^*\propto (1+Qz), with Q=4.

find that MRI-driven turbulence develops rapidly, with the saturated-state
Shakura & Sunyaev parameter alpha~(0.15-0.3) dominated by Maxwell stresses.
Many of the dimensionless characteristics of the turbulence (e.g. the ratio of
the Maxwell to Reynolds stresses) are similar to results from previous MRI
studies of accretion disks, hence insensitive to the degree of vertical disk
compression, shear rate, and the presence of self-gravity. The density-weighted
velocity dispersions in non- or weakly self-gravitating disks are sigma_x ~
sigma_y ~ (0.4-0.6)c_s and sigma_z~(0.2-0.3)c_s, suggesting that MRI can
contribute significantly to the observed level of galactic turbulence. The
saturated-state magnetic field strength B ~ 2 \mu G is similar to typical
galactic values. When self-gravity is strong enough, MRI-driven high-amplitude
density perturbations are swing-amplified to form Jeans-mass (~10^7 Msun) bound
clouds. Compared to previous unmagnetized or strongly-magnetized disk models,
the threshold for nonlinear instability in the present models occurs for
surface densities at least 50% lower, corresponding to the Toomre parameter
Q_th~1.6. We present evidence that self-gravitating clouds like GMCs formed
under conditions similar to our models can lose much of their original spin
angular momenta by magnetic braking, preferentially via fields threading
near-perpendicularly to their spin axes.

the outer region of an obscuring dusty molecular torus around a central
supermassive black hole. We detected 3.3 micron PAH emission in 11 of the 32
Seyfert 2 nuclei in our sample, providing evidence for the presence of compact
nuclear starbursts in a significant fraction of Seyfert 2 nuclei. However, the
rest-frame equivalent widths of the 3.3 micron PAH emission, and the 3.3 micron
PAH-to-infrared luminosity ratios measured in this study suggest that compact
nuclear starbursts generally do not contribute significantly to the observed
3-4 micron nuclear fluxes or to the infrared luminosities of Seyfert 2
galaxies. Small optical depths of absorption features at 3.4 micron from bare
dust and at 3.1 micron from ice-covered dust suggest that dust extinction
toward the 3-4 micron continuum-emitting region in the innermost part of the
obscuring dusty torus is modest: AV < 50-60 mag. Finally, the 3.3 micron PAH
emission luminosities measured in this study were found to be significantly
correlated with IRAS 12- and 25-micron, and nuclear N-band (10.6 micron)
luminosities. If these three luminosities trace the power of the active
galactic nucleus (AGN), then the luminosities of compact nuclear starbursts and
AGNs are correlated. This correlation is in agreement with theories predicting
that the presence of a compact nuclear starburst in the torus leads to an
enhancement of the mass accretion rate onto the central supermassive black
hole.

charge exchange, D/O is an important tracer for the value of the D/H ratio and
for potential spatial variations in the ratio. As the DI and OI column
densities are of similar orders of magnitude for a given sight line,
comparisons of the two values will generally be less subject to systematic
errors than comparisons of DI and HI, which differ by about five orders of
magnitude. Moreover, D/O is additionally sensitive to astration, because as
stars destroy deuterium, they should produce oxygen. We report here the results
of a survey of D/O in the interstellar medium performed with FUSE. We also
compare these results with those for D/N. Together with a few results from
previous missions, the sample totals 24 lines of sight. The distances range
from a few pc to ~2000 pc and log N(DI) from ~13 to ~16 (cm-2). The D/O ratio
is constant in the local interstellar medium out to distances of ~150 pc and
N(DI) ~ 1x10^15 cm-2, i.e. within the Local Bubble. In this region of the
interstellar space, we find D/O = (3.84+/-0.16)x10^-2 (1 sigma in the mean).
The homogeneity of the local D/O measurements shows that the spatial variations
in the local D/H and O/H must be extremely small, if any. A comparison of the
Local Bubble mean value with the few D/O measurements available for low
metallicity quasar sight lines shows that the D/O ratio decreases with cosmic
evolution, as expected. Beyond the Local Bubble we detected significant spatial
variations in the value of D/O. This likely implies a variation in D/H, as O/H
is known to not vary significantly over the distances covered in this study.
Our dataset suggests a present-epoch deuterium abundance below 1x10^-5, i.e.
lower than the value usually assumed, around 1.5x10^-5.

can be considered a radial one, but the high ratio (0.786) raises some problems
that can be solved only by admitting very low metallicity. It is quite evident
that some undetectable terms are again hidden in the noise, as the
least--squares fit leaves a rms residual much higher than the observational
noise. All that considered, nonradial modes seem to play a key role in the
light variability of V974 Oph. Revealing an unsuspected asteroseismic interest,
V974 Oph provides a link between low- and high-amplitude Delta Sct stars. By
discussing other high-amplitude Delta Sct stars showing unusual period ratios,
it is evident that the asteroseismic approach is possible also for this class
of pulsators.

the initial disk configuration, we produced the disks injecting matter from an
outer edge far from the central object. The period of oscillations is 2 - 50 s
respectively for the two cases, and the variation amplitude of the disc
luminosity is 10^38 - 10^39 erg/s. An explanation of this luminosity behavior
is proposed in terms of limit cycle instability: the disk oscillates between a
radiation pressure dominated configuration (with a high luminosity value) and a
gas pressure dominated one (with a low luminosity value). The origin of this
instability is the difference between the heat produced by viscosity and the
energy emitted as radiation from the disk surface (the well-known thermal
instability mechanism). We support this hypothesis showing that the limit cycle
behavior produces a sequence of collapsing and refilling states of the
innermost disk region.

during the period 2000-2001 using Chandra. This analysis leads us to the
following results. 1) NGC 3783 fluctuated in luminosity by a factor ~1.5 during
individual observations (~170 ks duration). These fluctuations were not
associated with significant spectral variations. 2) On a longer time scale
(20-120 days), we found the source to exhibit two very different spectral
shapes. The main difference between these can be well-described by the
appearance and disappearance of a spectral component that dominates the
underlying continuum at the longest wavelengths. The spectral variations are
not related to the brightening or the fading of the continuum at short
wavelengths in any simple way. 3) The appearance of the soft continuum
component is consistent with being the only spectral variation, and there is no
need to invoke changes in the opacity of the absorbers. 4) Photoionization
modeling indicates that a combination of three ionized absorbers, each split
into two kinematic components, can explain the strengths of almost all the
absorption lines and bound-free edges. All three components are thermally
stable and seem to have the same gas pressure. 5) The only real discrepancy
between our model and the observations concerns the range of wavelengths
absorbed by the iron M-shell UTA feature. This most likely arises as the result
of our underestimation of the poorly-known dielectronic recombination rates
appropriate for these ions. 6) The lower limit on the distance of the absorbing
gas in NGC 3783 is between 0.2 and 3.2 pc. The assumption of pressure
equilibrium imposes an upper limit of about 25 pc on the distance of the
least-ionized component from the central source. (abridged)

These are KV And, LL And, WX Cet, MM Hya, AO Oct, V2051 Oph, NY Ser, KK Tel, HV

  Periods, as usual, can be measured to high accuracy, and these are of special
interest since they carry dynamical information about the binary. We still have
not quite learned how to read the music, but a few things are clear. The
fractional superhump excess epsilon [=(P_sh-P_o)/P_o] varies smoothly with P_o.
The scatter of the points about that smooth curve is quite low, and can be used
to limit the intrinsic scatter in M_1, the white dwarf mass, and the
mass-radius relation of the secondary. The dispersion in M_1 does not exceed
24%, and the secondary-star radii scatter by no more than 11% from a fixed
mass-radius relation. For the well-behaved part of epsilon(P_o) space, we
estimate from superhump theory that the secondaries are 18+-6% larger than
theoretical ZAMS stars. This affects some other testable predictions about the
secondaries: at a fixed P_o, it suggests that the secondaries are (compared
with ZAMS predictions) 40+-14% less massive, 12+-4% smaller, 19+-6% cooler, and
less luminous by a factor 2.5(7). The presence of a well-defined mass-radius
relation, reflected in a well-defined epsilon(P_o) relation, strongly limits
effects of nuclear evolution in the secondaries.

structures gives rise to microstructural tracks and strain accommodation,
producing the observed irreversibility. Irrespective of the actual ground state
of each compound, the effect of thermal cycling is towards an increase of the
amount of the insulating phase in both compounds.

original one SU(2). Physically such a replacement is not quite natural or
desirable. In this paper we study the relationship between the black hole

considering parametrizations for the total cross sections belonging to the
class of entire functions in the logarithm of the energy, a series of results
is deduced and our main conclusions are the following: (1) except for the
subtraction constant, the derivative forms do not depend on any additional free
parameter; (2) the only approximation in going from integral to derivative
relations (at high energies) concerns to assume as zero the lower limit in the
integral form; (3) the previous approximation and the subtraction constant
affect the fit results at both low and high energies and therefore, the
subtraction constant can not be disregarded; (4) from a practical point of
view, for single-pole Pomeron and secondary reggeons parametrizations and
center-of-mass energies above 5 GeV, the derivative relations with the
subtraction constant as a free fit parameter are completely equivalent to the
integral forms with finite (non-zero) lower limit. A detailed review on the
conditions of validity and assumptions related with the replacement of integral
by derivative relations is also presented and discussed.

of the Cold Dark Matter component in our universe: First, it was shown that new
data on the nuclear abundance, B/C - and 10Be/9Be ratios constrain the
diffusion parameters in Galactic Models so strongly, that they lead to a clear
deficiency in the production of diffuse hard gamma rays, antiprotons and hard
positrons, if no anomalous sources or anomalous energy dependence of the
diffusion coefficients are postulated. Second, from the precise relic density
measurement by WMAP the WIMP annihilation cross section can be determined in a
model independent way. If the WIMPS are postulated to be the neutralinos of
Supersymmetry, then only a limited region of parameter space matches this
annihilation cross section. It is shown that the resulting positrons,
antiprotons and gamma rays from the neutralino annihilation (mainly into
b-quarks) provide the correct shape and magnitude for the missing fluxes in the
Galactic Models.
  The probability of a global fit to the galactic spectra of diffuse gamma
rays, positrons and antiprotons improves from about 10^{-8} to 0.5, if Dark
Matter, as predicted by Supersymmetry,is taken into account. This corresponds
to about 6 sigma evidence for the supersymmetric nature of Dark Matter in case
of Gaussian errors.

neutralino decay can be detected with good position and time resolutions by the
electormagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), while the photon momentum would be
precisely measured if the photon is converted inside the inner tracking
detector before reaching the ECAL. A new technique is developed to determine
the masses of the slepton ($\tilde{\ell}$) and the neutralino from events with
a lepton and a converted non-pointing photon arising from the cascade decay
$\tilde{\ell}\to \ell\tilde{\chi}^0_1\to \ell\gamma \tilde{G}$. A Monte Carlo
simulation at a sample point shows that the masses would be measured with an
error of 3% for $\cal{O}$(100) selected $\ell\gamma$ pairs. Once the sparticle
masses are determined by this method, the decay time and momentum of the
neutralino are solved using the ECAL data and the lepton momentum only, for all

Previous analysis showed that the quark hierarchy at the electroweak scale
could be achieved qualitatively without undue fine tuning due to the effects of
the 5-branes on the Kahler potential. We extend here this analysis to include
the leptons. A new mechanism is introduced to obtain neutrino masses by
assuming massless right handed neutrinos exist in the particle spectrum, which
allows a cubic holomorphic term to exist in the Kahler metric, l_L*H_2*nu_R,
scaled by the 11D Planck mass. After transferring this term to the
superpotential, this term gives rise to neutrino masses of the correct size at
the electroweak scale. With natural choices of the Yukawa and Kahler matrix

to the definition of ""C-lines"" associated with a monochromatic electric or

degenerate to circles. However, it was noted that RS vortices of monochromatic
fields generally oscillate at optical frequencies and are therefore
unobservable while electric and magnetic C-lines are steady. Here I show that
under the additional assumption of having definite helicity, RS vortices are
not only steady but they coincide with both sets of C-lines, electric and
magnetic. The two concepts therefore become one for waves of definite frequency
and helicity. Since the definition of RS vortices is relativistically invariant
while that of C-lines is not, it may be useful to regard the vortices as a
wideband generalization of C-lines for waves of definite helicity.

envision a scanning system consisting of a DC induction field, a transport

SQUID amplifiers. We performed a set of computer simulations using
experimentally determined values for concentrations of paramagnetic particles
achievable in specific tissues of the mouse in vivo and concentrations of

was selected so that for an average adult scanning both the anterior and

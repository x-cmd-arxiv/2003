and X-ray imaging investigation of LINERs using archival observations from the
ISO-SWS and the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer. Although the sample
is heterogenous and incomplete, this is the first comprehensive study of the
mid-infrared fine structure line emission of LINERs. These results have been
compared with similar observations of starburst galaxies and AGN. We find that
LINERs very clearly fall between starbursts and AGN in their mid-IR fine
structure line spectra, showing L_[OIV]26um/L_FIR and
L_[OIV]26um/L_[NeII]12.8um ratios, both measures of the dominant nuclear energy
source in dust-enshrouded galaxies, intermediate between those of AGN and
starbursts. Chandra imaging observations of the LINERs reveal hard nuclear
point sources morphologically consistent with AGN in most (67%) of the sample,
with a clear trend with IR-brightness. Most LINERs that show a single dominant
hard compact X-ray core are IR-faint ((L_FIR/L_B < 1), whereas most LINERs that
show scattered X-ray sources are IR-bright. A comparative X-ray/mid-IR
spectroscopic investigation of LINERs reveals some puzzling results. Objects
that display strong hard nuclear X-ray cores should also display high
excitation lines in the IR. However, we find two LINERs disagree with this
expectation. The galaxy NGC 404 shows weak soft X-ray emission consistent with
a starburst but has the most prominent highest excitation mid-IR spectrum of
our entire sample. Using IR emission line diagnostics alone, this galaxy would
be classified as hosting a dominant AGN. Conversely, the IR luminous LINER NGC
6240 has an extremely luminous binary AGN as revealed by the X-rays but shows
weak IR emission lines.

(rms). These variations appear uncorrelated with asteroids physical
characteristics such as diameter (in the probed 1-10 km range), taxonomic
class, and family membership. Despite such a lack of correlation, which implies
a random nature for the cause of color variability, a suite of tests suggest
that the detected variations are not instrumental effects. In particular, the
observed color variations are incompatible with photometric errors, and, for
objects observed at least four times, the color change in the first pair of
observations is correlated with the color change in the second pair. These
facts strongly suggest that the observed effect is real, and also indicate that
for some asteroids color variations are larger than for others. The detected
color variations can be explained as due to inhomogeneous albedo distribution
over an asteroid surface. Although relatively small, these variations suggest
that fairly large patches with different color than their surroundings exist on
a significant fraction of asteroids. This conclusion is in agreement with
spatially resolved color images of several large asteroids obtained by NEAR
spacecraft and HST.

universe was reionized at an early epoch, z ~ 20. Such early reionization is
likely to be caused by UV photons from first stars, but it appears that the
observed high optical depth can be reconciled within the standard structure
formation model only if star-formation in the early universe was extremely
efficient. With normal star-formation efficiencies, cosmological models with
non-Gaussian density fluctuations may circumvent this conflict as high density
peaks collapse at an earlier epoch than in models with Gaussian fluctuations.
We study cosmic reionization in non-Gaussian models and explore to what extent,
within available constraints, non-Gaussianities affect the reionization
history. For mild non-Gaussian fluctuations at redshifts of 30 to 50, the
increase in optical depth remains at a level of a few percent and appears
unlikely to aid significantly in explaining the measured high optical depth. On
the other hand, within available observational constraints, increasing the
non-Gaussian nature of density fluctuations can easily reproduce the optical
depth and may remain viable in underlying models of non-Gaussianity with a
scale-dependence.

of the resulting photoionization rates to the observed Gunn-Peterson effect at
high redshifts constrains the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies
to be less than a few percent. Near 1 Ry, thermal and stellar emission are
comparable amounting to about 10 %, 20 % and 35 % of the total flux at
redshifts of 3, 4.5 and higher, respectively. However, near the ionization
threshold for HeII, the thermal contribution is much stronger. It is comparable
to the QSO intensity already at redshift ~3 and dominates at redshifts above 4.
Thermal photons alone are enough to produce and sustain HeII reionization
already at z~6. We discuss the possible implications of our results for the
thermal history of the intergalactic medium, in particular for HeII
reionization.

100 K for OCS and SO2, indicating that most observed emission traces the outer
parts (T<100 K) of the molecular envelopes, except high-excitation OCS and SO2

program, using the physical structures of the sources derived from previous
submillimeter continuum and CS line data, are ~10^-8 for OCS, ~10^-9 for H2S,
H2CS, SO and SO2, and ~10^-10 for HCS+ and NS. In the inner envelopes (T>100 K)

are consistent with models of envelope chemistry which invoke ice evaporation

in the ices is probably OCS, not H2S as most models assume. The

the accretion timescale (~10^5 yr), much longer than the sound-crossing and

exceed the fast mode speed everywhere and (2) the circumpolar current increases
with distance from the source.We show that asymptotic hoop stress collimation
is mathematically robust and we give strong arguments why recent

thorough analysis of the static yield stress is presented via simulations under
imposed stress. Furthermore, using steady shear simulations, the effect of
physical aging, shear rate and temperature on the stress-strain relation is
investigated. In particular, we find that the stress at the yield point (the
``peak''-value of the stress-strain curve) exhibits a logarithmic dependence
both on the imposed shear rate and on the ``age'' of the system in qualitative
agreement with experiments on amorphous polymers and on metallic glasses. In
addition to the very observation of the yield stress which is an important
feature seen in experiments on complex systems like pastes, dense colloidal
suspensions and foams, further links between our model and soft glassy
materials are found. An example are hysteresis loops in the system response to
a varying imposed stress. Finally, we measure the static yield stress for our
model and study its dependence on temperature. We find that for temperatures
far below the mode coupling critical temperature of the model ($Tc = 0.435$),
$\sigmay$ decreases slowly upon heating followed by a stronger decrease as
$\Tc$ is approached. We discuss the reliability of results on the static yield
stress and give a criterion for its validity in terms of the time scales

review theoretical results for the analyses of superconducting properties of
these materials based on the Fermi-liquid framework in the single- and
multi-band Hubbard model. It is emphasized that the Coulomb interaction induces
various types of anisotropic superconductivity, $d$- or p-wave, through the
momentum dependence of quasi-particle interaction. While some inter-orbital
interactions exist in the multi-orbital system, anisotropic superconductivity
is induced by essentially the same mechanism, namely the momentum dependence of
quasi-particle interaction. This is the understanding of the mechanism of
superconductivity in SCES. Another important purpose of this article is to
review anomalous electronic properties of SCES near the Mott transition.
Especially, we focus on pseudogap phenomena observed in under-doped cuprates
and organic superconductors. According to the recent theory, superconducting
fluctuations, inherent in the quasi-two-dimensional and strong-coupling
superconductors, are the origin of the pseudogap formation. Based on the
microscopic theory of the superconducting fluctuations, we discuss the magnetic
and transport properties as well as the single-particle spectra in the

review the various perturbative and early nonperturbative approaches used to
investigate these systems. We argue that none of them provides a completely
satisfactory description of the three-dimensional critical behavior. We then
recall the principles of the nonperturbative approach - the effective average
action method - that we have used to investigate the physics of frustrated
magnets. First, we recall the treatment of the unfrustrated - O(N) - case with
this method. This allows to introduce its technical aspects. Then, we show how
this method unables to clarify most of the problems encountered in the previous
theoretical descriptions of frustrated magnets. Firstly, we get an explanation
of the long-standing mismatch between different perturbative approaches which
consists in a nonperturbative mechanism of annihilation of fixed points between
two and three dimensions. Secondly, we get a coherent picture of the physics of
frustrated magnets in qualitative and (semi-) quantitative agreement with the
numerical and experimental results. The central feature that emerges from our
approach is the existence of scaling behaviors without fixed or pseudo-fixed
point and that relies on a slowing-down of the renormalization group flow in a
whole region in the coupling constants space. This phenomenon allows to explain
the occurence of generic weak first order behaviors and to understand the
absence of universality in the critical behavior of frustrated magnets.

function alone, but an additional function $\xi(t,t_w)$, which has been rarely
discussed before is required. This function depends on the two times also
relevant for the response and the correlation and vanishes under equilibrium
conditions. It can be expressed in terms of the propagators and the transition
rates of the master equation but it is not related to any physical observable
in an obvious way. Instead, it is determined by inhomogeneities in the temporal
evolution of the distribution function of the stochastic variable under

tensor and through the Field Equations (FE) the energy-momentum tensor. However
one cannot write the FE explicitly until a class of observers has been
considered. Every class of observers defines a decomposition of the
energy-momentum tensor in terms of the dynamical variables energy density
($\mu$), the isotropic pressure ($p$), the heat flux $q^a$ and the traceless
anisotropic pressure tensor $\pi_{ab}$. The solution of the FE requires
additional assumptions among the dynamical variables known with the generic
name equations of state. These imply that the properties of the matter for a
given class of observers depends not only on the energy-momentum tensor but on
extra a priori assumptions which are relevant to that particular class of
observers. This makes difficult the comparison of the Physics observed by
different classes of observers for the {\it same} spacetime metric. One way to
overcome this unsatisfactory situation is to define the extra condition
required among the dynamical variables by a geometric condition, which will be
based on the metric and not to the observers. Among the possible and multiple
conditions one could use the consideration of collineations. We examine this
possibility for the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker models admitting
matter and Ricci collineations and determine the equations of state for the
comoving observers. We find linear and non-linear equations of state, which
lead to solutions satisfying the energy conditions, therefore describing
physically viable cosmological models.

aim to study mirror symmetry by studying the log structures of Illusie-Fontaine
and Kato on degenerations of Calabi-Yau manifolds. The basic idea is that one
can associate to certain sorts of degenerations of Calabi-Yau manifolds a log
Calabi-Yau space, which is a log structure on the degenerate fibre. Then many
statements about mirror symmetry which one hopes to be true for the general
fibre should first be proved for this log CY space. In this paper we begin by
discussing affine manifolds with singularities. Given such an affine manifold
along with a polyhedral decomposition, we show how to construct a scheme
consisting of a union of toric varieties. In certain non-degenerate cases, we
can also construct log structures on these schemes. Conversely, given certain
sorts of degenerations, one can build an affine manifold with singularities
structure on the dual intersection complex of the degeneration. Mirror symmetry
is then obtained as a discrete Legendre transform on these affine manifolds,
thus providing an algebro-geometrization of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow
conjecture. The deepest result of this paper shows an isomorphism between log
complex moduli of a log CY space and log Kahler moduli of its mirror.

  some preliminary results",,,,"nucl-ex hep-ex",,"  Measurements of identified particles over a broad $p_T$ range may provide
strong evidence for the existence of a thermalized partonic state in heavy-ion
collisions (\textit{i.e.} a quark-gluon plasma). Of particular interest are the
centrality dependence and the azimuthal anisotropy in the yield of baryons and
mesons at intermediate $p_T$. The first measurements of $v_2$ and the
number-of-binary-collisions scaled centrality ratio $R_{CP}$ for $K_S^0$ and
$\Lambda+\bar{\Lambda}$ production in Au+Au collisions at RHIC are presented.
These measurements from the STAR detector establish the particle-type
dependence of $v_2$ and $R_{CP}$ within $0.4 < p_T < 6.0$. At intermediate
$p_T$ (1.5--4.5 GeV/c) $v_2$ of $K_S^0$ and $\Lambda+\bar{\Lambda}$ is shown to
follow a number-of-constituent-quark scaling with v_2^{kaon}(p_T/2)/2 =
v_2^{lambda}(p_T/3)/3. $R_{CP}$ shows that lambda production at intermediate
$p_T$ increases more rapidly with system size than kaon production: consistent
with multi-parton dynamics in particle production. At $p_T = 5.5$ GeV/c lambda,
kaon, and charged hadron production are suppressed by a similar factor ($R_{CP}
\approx 0.33$): establishing the extent of the centrality dependent baryon
enhancement. The particle- and $p_T$-dependence of $v_2$, and $R_{CP}$ are
consistent with expectations based on hadronization of bulk partonic matter by
coalescence. As such, the constituent-quark-number scaled $v_2$ may reflect the
anisotropy established in a partonic stage providing strong evidence for the
existence of a quark-gluon plasma in Au+Au collisions at RHIC.

flagellar beat/wave patterns in African trypanosomes by microscopically
examining the flagellar movements of chemically tethered cells. The dynamic
nature of the different beat/wave patterns suggests that flagellar motion in
Trypanosoma brucei is a complex mixture of oscillating waves, rigid bends,
helical twists and non-linear waves. Interestingly, we have observed
soliton-like depression waves along the flagellar membrane, suggesting a
nonlinear mechanism for the dynamics of this system. The physical model is
inspired by the 2-dimensional elastic dynamics of a beam, and by taking into
account uniform distribution of molecular motors torque and nonlinear terms in
the curvature.

PMTs are read-out with analog memory chips. The detector was tested at the
KEK-PS pi2 beam line in November, 2002. To evaluate systematically the
performance of the detector, tests were carried out with various aerogel
samples using pion beams with momenta between 0.5 GeV/c and 4 GeV/c. The
typical angular resolution was around 14 mrad, and the average number of

  Conference on Laser Spectroscopy (2003)",,"10.1142/9789812703002_0047",,"quant-ph",,"  Entanglement is a resource central to quantum information (QI). In
particular, entanglement shared between two distant parties allows them to do
certain tasks that would otherwise be impossible. In this context, we study the
effect on the available entanglement of physical restrictions on the local
operations that can be performed by the two parties. We enforce these physical
restrictions by generalized superselection rules (SSRs), which we define to be
associated with a given group of physical transformations. Specifically the
generalized SSR is that the local operations must be covariant with respect to
that group. Then we operationally define the entanglement constrained by a SSR,
and show that it may be far below that expected on the basis of a naive (or
``fluffy bunny'') calculation. We consider two examples. The first is a
particle number SSR. Using this we show that for a two-mode BEC (with Alice
owning mode $A$ and Bob mode $B$), the useful entanglement shared by Alice and
Bob is identically zero. The second, a SSR associated with the symmetric group,
is applicable to ensemble QI processing such as in liquid-NMR. We prove that
even for an ensemble comprising many pairs of qubits, with each pair described
by a pure Bell state, the entanglement per pair constrained by this SSR goes to
zero for a large ensemble.

rates over a long period of time if the accretion can continue past the onset
of core hydrogen ignition. The accretion may continue despite the formation of
an ionized HII region around the star if the HII region is small enough that
the gravitational attraction of the star dominates the thermal pressure of the
HII region. The accretion may continue despite radiation pressure acting
against dust grains in the molecular gas if the momentum of the accretion flow
is sufficient to push the dust grains through a narrow zone of high dust
opacity at the ionization boundary and into the HII region where the dust is
sublimated. This model of massive star formation by continuing accretion
predicts a new class of gravitationally-trapped, long-lived hypercompact HII
regions. The observational characteristics of the trapped hypercompact HII
regions can be predicted for comparison with observations.

instrument on the nearby star Procyon A (alpha CMi A, F5IV-V), at a relative
precision of +/- 0.9%. We obtain a uniform disk angular diameter in the K band
of UD = 5.376 +/- 0.047 mas and a limb darkened value of LD = 5.448 +/- 0.053
mas. Together with the Hipparcos parallax, this gives a linear diameter of
2.048 +/- 0.025 D_sun. We use this result in combination with spectroscopic,
photometric and asteroseismic constraints to model this star with the CESAM
code. One set of modeling parameters that reproduces the observations within
their error bars are an age of 2314 Myr, an initial helium mass fraction Y_i =
0.301 and an initial mass ratio of heavy elements to hydrogen Z/X_i = 0.0314.
We also computed the adiabatic oscillation spectrum of our model of Procyon A,
giving a mean large frequency separation of Delta nu_0 = 54.7 microHz. This
value is in agreement with the seismic observations by Martic et al. (1999,
2001). The interferometric diameter and the asteroseismic large frequency
spacing together suggest a mass closer to 1.4 M_sun than to 1.5 M_sun. We
conclude that Procyon is currently ending its life on the main sequence, as its
luminosity class indicates.

with double peaks or twin shoulders and of these, 60% can be fitted quite well
with a model attributing the emission to a circular, relativistic, disk. We
also compare the Hb and MgII profiles of 4 objects with models of photoionized
accretion disks and find them to be in reasonable agreement. Double-peaked
emitters stand out on the basis of the following properties: (1) unusually
large contribution of starlight to the optical continuum around Ha, (2)
unusually large equivalent widths of low-ionization lines ([OI] and [SII]), (3)
unusually large [OI]/[OIII] ratios, and (4) Balmer lines on average twice as
broad as in other radio-loud AGNs. We evaluate models for the origin of the
lines and we find accretion-disk emission to be the most successful one because
it can explain the double-peaked line profiles and it also offers an
interpretation of the spectroscopic properties of these objects. Aternative
suggestions (binary broad-line regions, bipolar outflows, anisotropically
illuminated spherical broad-line regions) are unsatisfactory because (a) they
fail direct observational tests, (b) they cannot explain the unusual properties
of double-peaked emitters self-consistently, or (c) their physical foundations
appear to be unsound. We suggest that in double-peaked emitters and accretion-
powered LINERs the accretion rate is considerably lower than the Eddington rate
with the consequence that the inner accretion disk takes the form of an ion
torus and the wind that normally enshrouds the disk proper is absent.

for the interactions between X-ray-emitting gas and radio plasma that are
thought to determine the large-scale radio structure of these sources. The
temperatures that we measure for the two environments are significantly higher
than those predicted by standard luminosity-temperature relations for clusters
and groups. We show that luminosity-temperature relations for radio-quiet and
radio-loud X-ray groups differ, in the sense that radio-source heating may
operate in most groups containing radio galaxies. If the radio lobes are
expanding subsonically, we find minimum ages of 3e8 years for 3C 66B, and 5e8
years for 3C 449, older than the values obtained from spectral ageing, which
would give the radio source sufficient time to heat the groups to the observed
temperatures for plausible values of the jet power. The external pressures in
the atmospheres of both radio galaxies are an order of magnitude higher than
equipartition estimates of their radio-lobe pressures, confirming that the
radio lobes are either out of equipartition or require a pressure contribution
from non-radiating particles. Constraints from the level of X-ray emission we
measure from the radio lobes allow us to conclude that a departure from
equipartition must be in the direction of magnetic domination, and that the
most plausible candidates for a particle contribution to lobe pressure are
relativistic protons, an additional population of low-energy electrons, or
entrained and heated thermal material.

However, estimates of the chance probability of this clustering signal vary
from 10^{-2} to 10^{-6} and beyond. It is essential that the strength of this
evidence be well understood in order to compare it with anisotropy studies in
other cosmic ray experiments. We apply two methods for extracting a meaningful
significance from this data set: one can scan for the cuts which optimize the
clustering signal, using simulations to determine the appropriate statistical
penalty for the scan. This analysis finds a chance probability of about 0.3%.
Alternatively, one can optimize the cuts with a first set of data, and then
apply them to the remaining data directly without statistical penalty. One can
extend the statistical power of this test by considering cross-correlation
between the initial data and the remaining data, as long as the initial
clustering signal is not included. While the scan is more useful in general, in
the present case only splitting the data set offers an unbiased test of the
clustering hypothesis. Using this test we find that the AGASA data is
consistent at the 8% level with the null hypothesis of isotropically
distributed arrival directions.

factor of two on timescales of 20-40 ks. Each spectrum could be fit by either
an absorbed power-law model with a photon index of ~3 or a thin-thermal plasma
model with a temperature of ~2 keV and an extremely low metal abundance (<~0.1
solar). The spectrum of the first observation has a weak-line feature at about
6.8 keV, which might correspond to highly ionized iron Kalpha. In contrast, the
spectrum of the second observation apparently shows a weak edge absorption
component at E~4 keV. The continuum emission and log LX/Lbol ~ -6 are similar
to those of young intermediate-mass stars (Herbig Ae/Be stars), although the
presence of a strong magnetic field (inferred from the detection of non-thermal
radio emission) has drawn an analogy between rho Ophiuchus S1 and magnetic
chemically peculiar (MCP) stars. If the X-ray emission is thermal, the small
abundances that we derived might be related to the inverse first-ionization
potential (FIP) effect, though there is no significant trend as a function of
FIP from our model fits. If the emission is non-thermal, it might be produced
by high-energy electrons in the magnetosphere.

between the abundances of Si, S, Ar, and Ca indicate that the alpha-elements do
not behave homogeneously as a single group. We show that the abundances of the
most well-determined elements Fe, Si, and S in conjunction with recent
theoretical supernovae yields do not give a consistent solution for the
fraction of material produced by Type Ia and Type II supernovae at any

have more of their metals produced in Type II supernovae than in Type Ias. The
inconsistency of our results with abundances in the Milky Way indicate that
spiral galaxies are not the dominant metal contributors to the intracluster
medium (ICM). The pattern of elemental abundances requires an additional source
of metals beyond standard SNIa and SNII enrichment. The properties of this new
source are well matched to those of Type II supernovae with very massive,
metal-poor progenitor stars. These results are consistent with a significant
fraction of the ICM metals produced by an early generation of population III

II emission lines. The spectrum broadly resembles that of long-period,
cataclysmic variables in the galactic field.
  Combining our time-resolved FUV data with archival optical photometry of 47
Tuc, we refine the orbital period of AKO 9 and define an accurate ephemeris for
the system. We also place constraints on several other system parameters, using
a variety of observational constraints. We find that all of the empirical
evidence is consistent with AKO 9 being a long-period dwarf nova in which mass
transfer is driven by the nuclear expansion of a sub-giant donor star. We
therefore conclude that AKO 9 is the first spectroscopically confirmed
cataclysmic variable in 47 Tuc.
  We also briefly consider AKO 9's likely formation and ultimate evolution.
Regarding the former, we find that the system was almost certainly formed
dynamically, either via tidal capture or in a 3-body encounter. Regarding the
latter, we show that AKO 9 will probably end its CV phase by becoming a
detached, double WD system or by exploding in a Type Ia supernova.

radio-quiet, NLS1 IRAS 13224-3809. IRAS 13224-3809 continues to display the
extremely variable behavior that was previously observed with ROSAT and ASCA;
however, no giant, rapid flaring events are observed. We detect variations by a
factor as high as ~8 during the 64 ks observation, and the variability is
persistent throughout the light curve. Dividing the light curve into 9 minute
segments we found almost all of the segments to be variable at > 3 sigma. When
the time-averaged cross-correlation function is calculated for the 0.3-0.8 keV
band with the 3-10 keV band, the cross-correlation profile is skewed indicating
a possible smearing of the signal to longer times (soft band leading the hard).
A correlation between count rate and hardness ratio is detected in four energy
bands. In three cases the correlation is consistent with spectral hardening at
lower count rates which can be explained in terms of a partial-covering model.
The other band displays the reverse effect, showing spectral hardening at
higher count rates. We can explain this trend as a more variable power-law
component compared to the soft component. We also detect a delay between the
0.3-1.5 keV count rate and the 0.8-1.5 keV to 0.3-0.8 keV hardness ratio,
implying flux induced spectral variability. Such delays and asymmetries in the
cross correlation functions could be suggesting reprocessing of soft and hard
photons. In general, much of the timing behavior can be attributed to erratic
eclipsing behavior associated with the partial covering phenomenon, in addition
to intrinsic variability in the source. The variability behavior of IRAS
13224-3809 suggests a complicated combination of effects which we have started
to disentangle with this present analysis.

evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) in the Randall-Sundrum type II (RS2)

drastically modified from the ordinary four-dimensional case for the following
two reasons. (i) dropping Hawking temperature, which equivalently lengthens the
lifetime of the individual PBH due to the change of space-time topology and
(ii) the effective increase of the total amount of PBHs caused by accretion
during the earliest part of the radiation-dominated epoch, the brane
high-energy phase. From studies of the expected spectral shape and its
dependence on braneworld parameters, we obtain two qualitatively distinctive
possibilities of constraints on the braneworld PBHs from the observations of
diffuse high-energy photon background. If the efficiency of accretion in the
high-energy phase exceeds a critical value, the existence of the extra
dimension gives a more stringent upper bound on the abundance of PBHs than the
4D case and a small length scale for the extra dimension is favored. On the
contrary, in the case below the critical accretion efficiency, we find that the
constraint on the PBH abundance can be relaxed by a few orders of magnitude in
exchange for the existence of the large extra dimension; its size may be even
bounded in the region above 10^{19} times 4D Planck length scale provided the
rest mass energy density of the PBHs relative to energy density of radiation is
actually larger than 10^{-27} (4D upper bound) at their formation time. The
above analytical studies are also confirmed numerically, and an allowed region
for braneworld parameters and PBH abundance is clearly obtained.

the flexibility of alpha-helices using a principal-component analysis (PCA) of

beta-sheet flexibility using PCA on a database of beta-sheet structures. For

are found to be Gaussian and independent, suggesting that the PCA twist and
bend modes can be identified as the soft elastic normal modes of sheets. We

experiments on the cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O6.5. The sample, which has
Tc=45 K, was characterized by a high degree of purity and Ortho II ordering.
The change in reflectivity (Delta R) was induced and probed using pulses of 100
femtosecond duration and photon energy 1.55 eV from a Ti:Sapphire laser. We
provide a detailed picture of the decay rate (gamma) of Delta R as a function
of temperature T and pump intensity I. At low T, gamma decreases linearly with
decreasing I, extrapolating to nearly zero in the limit that I tends to zero.
At higher temperatures gamma has the same linear dependence, but with nonzero
limit as I goes to zero. In the interpretation of these results we assume that
Delta R is proportional to the nonequilibrium quasiparticle density created by
the laser. From an analysis of the gamma vs. I we estimate beta, the
coefficient of proportionality relating the quasiparticle decay rate to the
density. The intercept of gamma vs. I yields the thermal equilibrium
quasiparticle decay rate. In a discussion section, we argue that the
quasiparticles induced by the laser occupy primarily states near the antinodal
regions of the Brillouin zone. We explain the divergence of the lifetime as T
and I both tend to zero as a consequence of momentum and energy conservation in
electron-electron scattering. We discuss the significance of the measured value
of beta (approximately 0.1 cm2/s) in terms of the electron-phonon interactions.

In the static case, geodesic motion is recovered together with Newton's
attraction field. In the static spherical case, Schwarzschild's metric is got.
An asymptotic scheme of post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation is built by
associating a conceptual family of systems with the given weakly-gravitating
system. It is more general than the post-Newtonian scheme in that the velocity
may be comparable with $c$. This allows to justify why the 0PM approximation of
the energy rate may be equated to the rate of the Newtonian energy, as is
usually done. At the 0PM approximation of this theory, an isolated system loses
energy by quadrupole radiation, without any monopole or dipole term. It seems
plausible that the observations on binary pulsars (the pulse data) could be
nicely fitted with a timing model based on this theory.

of a field with arbitrary spin $s$ on a 3-brane embedded in a non-rotating,
uncharged (4+n)-dimensional black hole background. By numerical analysis, we
derive exact results for the greybody factors and emission rates for scalars,
fermions and gauge bosons emitted directly on the brane, for all energy regimes
and for an arbitrary number $n$ of extra dimensions. The relative emissivities
on the brane for different types of particles are computed and their dependence
on the dimensionality of spacetime is demonstrated -- we therefore conclude
that both the amount and the type of radiation emitted can be used for the
determination of $n$ if the Hawking radiation from these black holes is
observed. The emission of scalar modes in the bulk from the same black holes is
also studied and the relative bulk-to-brane energy emissivity is accurately
computed. We demonstrate that this quantity varies considerably with $n$ but
always remains smaller than unity -- this provides firm support to earlier
arguments made by Emparan, Horowitz and Myers.

the nonlinear heat equation is considered. In this case the control equation is

describe n curves. Given sets X_1,...,X_m the probability that for each k no
curve passes through X_k at time \tau_k is given by the Fredholm determinant of
a certain matrix kernel, the extended Hermite kernel. For this reason we call
this Dyson process the Hermite process. Similarly, when the entries of a
complex matrix undergo diffusion we call the evolution of its singular values
the Laguerre process, for which there is a corresponding extended Laguerre
kernel. Scaling the Hermite process at the edge leads to the Airy process and
in the bulk to the sine process; scaling the Laguerre process at the edge leads
to the Bessel process. Generalizing and strengthening earlier work, we assume
that each X_k is a finite union of intervals and find for the Airy process a
system of partial differential equations, with the end-points of the intervals
of the X_k as independent variables, whose solution determines the probability
that for each k no curve passes through X_k at time \tau_k. Then we find the
analogous systems for the Hermite process (which is more complicated) and also
for the sine process. Finally we find an analogous system of PDEs for the
Bessel process, which is the most difficult.

complexes is elliptic if the signature is Riemannian. We also construct gauge
companion operators which complete the exterior derivative to a conformally
invariant and (in the case of Riemannian signature) elliptically coercive
system. These (operator,gauge) pairs are used to define finite dimensional
conformally stable form subspaces which are are candidates for spaces of
conformal harmonics. These constructions are based on a family of operators on
closed forms which generalise in a natural way the Q-curvature. We give a
universal construction of these new operators and show that they yield new
conformally invariant global pairings between differential form bundles.
Finally we give a geometric construction of a family of conformally invariant
differential operators between density-valued differential form bundles and
develop their properties (including their ellipticity type in the case of
definite conformal signature). The construction is based on the ambient metric
of Fefferman and Graham, and its relationship to tractor bundles. For each form
order, our derivation yields an operator of every even order in odd dimensions,
and even order operators up to order $n$ in even dimension $n$. In the case of
unweighted forms as domain, these operators are the natural form analogues of
the critical order conformal Laplacian of Graham et al., and are key
ingredients in the new differential complexes mentioned above.

Hawton). Position and momenta are shown to satisfy the Heisenberg-Weyl

an appropriate photon Hamiltonian - using Maxwell equations as the photon
Schroedinger equation - a conjugate time of arrival operator is built. Its
interpretation, including the probability densities for the instant of arrival
(at arbitrary points of 3-D space) of photon states with different helicities

line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy NGC4051. We combine over 6.5 years of frequent
monitoring observations by RXTE with a >100ks continuous observation by
XMM-Newton and so present a powerspectral density (PSD) covering an
unprecedented frequency range of over 6.5 decades from <1e-8 to >1e-2 Hz. The
combined RXTE and XMM-Newton PSD is a very good match to the PSD of the
galactic black hole binary system (GBH) Cyg X-1 when in a `high', rather than
`low', state providing the first definite confirmation of an AGN in a `high'
state. We find a break in the PSD at a frequency \nu_{B}=8e-4 Hz. If \nu_{B}
scales linearly with mass then, assuming a black hole (BH) mass of 10 M_solar
for Cyg X-1, we imply a BH mass of 3e-5 M_solar in NGC4051, which is consistent
with the recently reported reverberation mapped value. Hence NGC4051 is
emitting at \sim30% L_{Edd}. We note that the higher energy photons lag the
lower energy ones and that the lag is greater for variations of longer Fourier
period and increases with the energy separation of the bands. Variations in
different wavebands are very coherent at long Fourier periods but the coherence
decreases at shorter periods and as the energy separation between bands
increases. This behaviour is similar to that of GBHs and suggests a radial
distribution of frequencies and photon energies with higher energies and higher
frequencies being associated with smaller radii [ABRIDGED].

clusters of galaxies. The cold fronts are believed to be produced by the bulk
motions of massive, dense, cold gas clouds with respect to the hotter, more
rarefied ambient gas at velocities that can be as high as the speed of sound.
This phenomenon may produce a significant contamination of both the kinetic SZ
effect and the CMB polarization pattern observed in the direction of a cluster.
We estimate the contributions to the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect and
to the CMB polarization toward galaxy clusters produced by the bulk motions of
the gas in the inner parts of galaxy clusters. The observed cold fronts probe
the absolute velocities of the gas motion while the induced polarization and
the kinetic SZ effect probe the transverse and the radial components,
respectively. We show that these signals may be easily detected with sensitive
future experiments, opening an exciting new window for studies of galaxy
cluster internal dynamics, and eventually facilitating reconstruction of the
intrinsic cluster polarization of the CMB and the associated measure of the
local CMB quadrupole.

  Journal","Astrophys.J.599:105-115,2003","10.1086/379241",,"astro-ph",,"  The intrinsic luminosity functions of extremely fast jets found in many
active galaxies and gamma-ray bursts are difficult to measure since their
apparent luminosities are strongly affected by relativistic beaming. Past
studies have only provided analytical predictions for the beamed
characteristics of populations in which all jets have the same Lorentz factor.
However, the jets found in active galaxies are known to span a large range of
speeds. Here we derive analytical expressions for the expected Doppler factor
distributions and apparent (beamed) luminosity functions of randomly-oriented,
two-sided jet populations which have bulk Lorentz factors distributed according
to a simple power-law over a range [G1, G2]. We find that if a jet population
has a uniform or inverted Lorentz factor distribution, its Doppler factor
distribution and beamed luminosity function will be very similar to that of a
jet population with Lorentz factors all equal to G2. In particular, the beamed
and intrinsic luminosity functions will have the same slope at high
luminosities. In the case of a steeply declining Lorentz factor distribution,
the slopes at high luminosities will also be identical, but only up to an
apparent luminosity equivalent to the upper cutoff of the intrinsic luminosity
function. Also, at very high apparent luminosities, the slope will be
proportional to the power law slope of the Lorentz factor distribution. At very
low luminosities, the form of the apparent luminosity function is very
sensitive to the lower cutoff and steepness of the Lorentz factor distribution.
We discuss how it should be possible to recover useful information about the
intrinsic luminosity functions of relativistic jets by studying flux-limited
samples selected on the basis of beamed jet emission.

recipes to describe the fate of the baryons within dark matter halos. The
simulations produce a detailed merging tree for the dark matter halos including
complete knowledge of the statistical properties arising from the gravitational

with special emphasis on the panchromatic spectral energy distribution emitted
by galaxies in the UV/optical and IR/submm wavelength ranges.

parameters that go into the model, comparing and contrasting with other
parallel efforts. We specifically illustrate the success of the model in
comparison to several datasets, showing how it is able to predict the galaxy
disc sizes, colours, luminosity functions from the ultraviolet to far infrared,
the Tully--Fisher and Faber--Jackson relations, and the fundamental plane in
the local universe. We also identify certain areas where the model fails, or
where the assumptions needed to succeed are at odds with observations, and pay
special attention to understanding the effects of the finite resolution of the
simulations on the predictions made. Other papers in this series will take
advantage of different data sets available in the literature to extend the
study of the limitations and predictive power of GalICS, with particular

broad types: ``Early'' (elliptical-like), ``Late'' (disk galaxies),
``Irregular'' and ``Other'' (chain galaxies and low surface brightness

For a broad range of limiting magnitudes and color thresholds, the relative
number of early-type EROs is approximately constant at 33-44%, and the comoving
space densities of Early- and Late-type EROs are comparable. Mean rest-frame
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at wavelengths between 0.1 and 1.2 um are
constructed for all EROs. The SEDs are extremely similar in their range of
shapes, independent of morphological type. The implication is that any
differences between the broad-band SEDs of Early-type EROs and the other types
are relatively subtle, and there is no robust way of photometrically
distinguishing between different morphological types with usual

evolution, we use the large databases of measured RR Lyrae parameters for the
globular cluster M3 (NGC 5272) recently provided by Bakos et al. and Corwin &
Carney. We compare the observed distribution of fundamentalized periods against
the predictions of synthetic HBs. The observed distribution shows a sharp peak
at P_f ~ 0.55 d, which is primarily due to the RRab variables, whereas the
model predictions instead indicate that the distribution should be more uniform
in P_f, with a buildup of variables with shorter periods (P_f < 0.5 d).
Detailed statistical tests show, for the first time, that the observed and
predicted distributions are incompatible with one another at a high
significance level. We show that the sharp peak in the M3 period distribution
receives a significant contribution from the Blazhko variables in the cluster.
We also show that M15 (NGC 7078) and M68 (NGC 4590) show similar peaks in their
P_f distributions, which in spite of being located at a similar P_f value as
M3's, can be primarily ascribed to the RRc variables. Again similar to M3, a
demise of RRc variables towards the blue edge of the instability strip is
present in these two globulars. This is again in sharp contrast with the
evolutionary scenario, which also foresees a strong buildup of RRc variables
with short periods in OoII globulars. We speculate that, in OoI systems, RRab
variables may get ""trapped"" close to the transition line between RRab and RRc
pulsators as they evolve to the blue, whereas in OoII systems it is the RRc
variables that may get ""trapped"" instead, as they evolve to the red, before
changing their pulsation mode to RRab. Such a scenario is supported by the
available CMDs and Bailey diagrams for M3, M15, and M68.

density is expected to have lowered and dust grains to have gravitationally
settled to the midplane. If the local dust-to-gas mass ratio near the midplane
is increased above cosmic abundances by factors > 10^3, current sheets reach
high enough temperatures to melt millimeter-sized dust grains, and hence may
provide the mechanism to form meteoritic chondrules. In addition, these current
sheets possibly explain the near-infrared excesses observed in spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of young stellar objects. Direct imaging of protoplanetary
disks via a nulling interferometer or, in the future, a multi-band, adaptive

by the first supernovae in the Universe. If the first stars in a 10^7 Msun dark
halo were very massive (>180 Msun), then a pair instability supernova from a
single massive star can produce sufficient iron to enrich 10^6 Msun of
pristine, primordial gas to [Fe/H] ~ -2. In such a scenario, where a single
massive star acts as a seed for halo GCs, the accurate abundance analysis of GC
stars would allow a direct measurement of the Population III initial mass.
Using the latest theoretical yields for zero metallicity stars in the mass
range 140-260 Msun, we find that the metals expelled from a ~230 Msun star are
consistent with [Si/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] observed in GC stars. However, no single
star in this mass range can simultaneously explain all halo GC heavy-element
abundance ratios, such as [V/Fe], [Ti/Fe] and [Ni/Fe]. These require a
combination masses for the Population III stellar progenitors. The various
observational consequences of this scenario are discussed.

not optimal for many permutations. In this paper, we present a novel $O(\log

permutation-specific control-optimal}. The KR-Benes routes {\it every}
permutation with the minimal control complexity {\it specific} to that
permutation and its worst-case complexity for arbitrary permutations is bounded
by the Benes; thus it replaces the Benes when considering control
complexity/latency. We design the KR-Benes by first constructing a restricted
$2 \log K +2$ depth rearrangeable network called $K$-Benes for routing
$K$-bounded permutations with control $2N \log K$, $0 \leq K \leq N/4$. We then
show that the $N \times N$ Benes network itself (with one additional stage)
contains every $K$-Benes network as a subgraph and use this property to
construct the KR-Benes network. With regard to the control-optimality of the
KR-Benes, we show that any optimal network for rearrangeably routing
$K$-bounded permutations must have depth $2 \log K + 2$, and therefore the
$K$-Benes (and hence the KR-Benes) is optimal.

induced by the interaction between the nonzero neutrino magnetic moment and
supernova magnetic fields, are studied for both normal and inverted mass
hierarchy. As the case for the pure matter-induced neutrino oscillation
(Mikheyev--Smirnov--Wolfenstein (MSW) effect), we find that the RSF transitions
are strongly dependent on the neutrino mass hierarchy as well as the value of
$\theta_{13}$. Flavour conversions are solved numerically for various neutrino
parameter sets, with presupernova profile calculated by Woosley and Weaver. In
particular, it is very interesting that the RSF-induced
$\nu_\rme\to\bar\nu_\rme$ transition occurs, if the following conditions are
all satisfied: the value of $\mu_\nu B$ ($\mu_\nu$ is the neutrino magnetic
moment, and $B$ is the magnetic field strength) is sufficiently strong, the
neutrino mass hierarchy is inverted, and the value of $\theta_{13}$ is large
enough to induce adiabatic MSW resonance. In this case, the strong peak due to
original $\nu_\rme$ emitted from neutronization burst would exist in time
profile of the neutrino events detected at the Super-Kamiokande detector. If
this peak were observed in reality, it would provide fruitful information on
the neutrino properties. On the other hand, characters of the neutrino spectra
are also different between the neutrino models, but we find that there remains
degeneracy among several models. Dependence on presupernova models is also
discussed.

exponential maps are conjugate on their sets of escaping points; in fact, we
construct an analog of Douady's ""pinched disk model"" for the Julia sets of
these maps. On the other hand, we show that two exponential maps are generally
not conjugate on their sets of escaping sets. Using the correspondence with our
model, we also answer several questions about escaping endpoints of external
rays, such as when a ray is differentiable in such an endpoints or how slowly
these endpoints can escape to infinity.

$ApA=A$.) This result is extended to arbitrary (unital) rings $A$ in the
present paper: If $p$ is a full idempotent in $A$, then $sr(pAp) \geq sr(A)$.
The proofs rely partly on algebraic analogs of Blackadar's methods, and partly
on a new technique for reducing problems of higher stable rank to a concept of
stable rank one for skew (rectangular) corners $pAq$. The main result yields
estimates relating stable ranks of Morita equivalent rings. In particular, if

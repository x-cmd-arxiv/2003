by UVB radiation in a reionized universe. For the purpose, we perform
three-dimensional radiation smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics calculations, where
the radiative transfer is solved by a direct method and also the
non-equilibrium chemistry of primordial gas including H$_2$ molecules is
incorporated. Attention is concentrated on radiative transfer effects against
UVB for the formation of subgalactic objects with $T_{\rm vir}\la 10^4$K. We
consider the reionization model with $z_{\rm reion} \approx 7$ and also the
earlier reionization model ($z_{\rm reion} \approx 17$) inferred by the WMAP.
We find that the star formation is suppressed appreciably by UVB, but baryons
at high-density peaks are self-shielded even during the reionization, forming
some amount of stars eventually. In that sense, the photoevaporation for
subgalactic systems is not so perfect as argued by one-dimensional spherical
calculations. The final stellar fraction depends on the collapse epoch and the
mass of system, but almost regardless of the reionization epoch. For instance,
a few tenths of formed stars are born after the cosmic reionization in $z_{\rm
reion} \approx 7$ model, while more than 90% stars are born after the
reionization in the WMAP reionization model. Thus, effects of UVB feedback on
the substructure problem with CDM scenario should be evaluated with careful
treatment of the radiative transfer. The star clusters formed at high-density
peaks coalesce with each other in a dissipationless fashion in a dark matter
potential, resultantly forming a spheroidal system. As a result, these low-mass
galaxies have large mass-to-light ratios such as observed in dwarf spheroidals
in the Local Group.

  Quasar Pairs","40 pages, 15 figures; submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  A comparison between the line of sight power spectrum of absorption in the
Lyman-alpha forest and the cross power spectrum between the absorption in
neighboring lines of sight offers an evolution-free means to constrain the
cosmological constant, or dark energy. Using cosmological simulations, we
consider a maximum likelihood method to obtain constraints from this
comparison. In our method, measurements of the auto and cross spectra from
observations are compared with those from a multi-parameter grid of simulated
models of the intergalactic medium. We then marginalize over nuisance
parameters to obtain constraints on the cosmological constant. Redshift space
distortions due to peculiar velocities and thermal broadening, a potential
difficulty in applying this test, are explicitly modeled in our simulations. To
illustrate our method, we measure the cross spectrum from a new sample of five
close quasar pairs, with separations of 0.5 to 3 arcmin. We attempt to obtain a
constraint on Omega_Lambda, but find only weak constraints. An
Einstein-de-Sitter cosmology is, however, disfavored by the data at a ~ 2 sigma
confidence level. We consider the power of future observations, paying
particular attention to the effects of spectral resolution and shot-noise. We
find that ~ 50 moderate resolution, FWHM ~ 150 km/s, close separation (~ 30-120
arcsec) pairs should allow a (2 sigma) constraint on Omega_Lambda at the level
of 15%, if other modeling parameters are determined through other means. We
find that there is a sizeable gain from observing very close, ~ 30 arcsec,
separation pairs provided they are observed with high spectral resolution. A
sample of ~ 10 such pairs gives similar constraints to the 50 moderate
resolution pairs mentioned above.

all sources of uncertainty, is 1.7 km/s. Two similar data sets were obtained
one month apart, and the total error in the relative velocities is 0.80 km/s\
in the case where an object is common to both data sets. The data are used to
characterize the velocity distribution of the old population in the Galctic
Center. We find that the stars have a Gaussian velocity distribution with a
mean heliocentric velocity of $-10.1\pm$11.0 km/s (blueshifted) and a standard
deviation of 100.9$\pm7.7$ km/s; the mean velocity of the sample is consistent
with no bulk line-of-sight motion with respect to the Local Standard of Rest.
At the 1 sigma level, the data are consistent with a symmetric velocity
distribution about any arbitrary axis in the plane of the sky. We find evidence
for a flattening in the distribution of late-type stars within a radius of
$\sim$0.4 \pc, and infer a volume density distribution of r$^{-1/4}$ in this

which can be compared to subsequent epochs to measure small accelerations (1
km/s/yr), corresponding to the magnitude expected over a timespan of several

dimension is semi-infinite. The final form of the potential involves a
self-adjoint extension parameter $\alpha$, which plays a role of an additional
mass (or distance) scale. The striking feature of Newton potential in this
setup is that the potential behaves as seven-dimensional in long range when
$\alpha$ is nonzero. For small $\alpha$ there is an intermediate range where
the potential is five-dimensional. Five-dimensional Newton constant decreases
with increase of $\alpha$ from zero. In the short range the four-dimensional
behavior is recovered. The physical implication of this result is discussed in
the context of the accelerating behavior of universe.

  Quantum Electrodynamics","25 pages, 1 figure, LaTex",,,,"hep-th",,"  In this paper the nonperturbative analysis of the spectrum for one-particle
excitations of the electron-positron field (EPF) is considered in the paper. A
standard form of the quantum electrodynamics (QED) is used but the charge of
the ""bare"" electron $e_0$ is supposed to be of a large value. It is shown that
in this case the quasi-particle can be formed with a non-zero averaged value of
the scalar component of the electromagnetic field (EMF). Self-consistent
equations for the distribution of charge density in the ""physical"" electron
(positron) are derived. A variational solution of these equations is obtained
and it defines the finite renormalization of the charge and mass of the
electron (positron). It is found that the coupling constant between EPF and EMF
and mass of the ""bare"" electron can be connected with the observed values of
the fine structure constant and the mass of the ""physical"" electron. It is also
shown that although the non-renormalized QED corresponds to the strong coupling
between EPF and EMF, the interaction between ""physical"" electron (positron)
with EMF is defined by the observed value of the coupling constant. It is
proved that the translational motion of the ""physical"" particle is separated
from its internal degrees of freedom. As a result the dependence of the
one-particle excitation energy on its total momentum corresponds to the
relativistic spectrum of a free particle with the observed value of mass.
Regularization of the terms of a series of the perturbation theory is due to
the form-factor of the ""physical"" electron (positron).

current, and the equation of motion together with this constraint equation
determines the classical behavior of both the closed string field and the

source. We see that the ordinary boundary state cannot be a source of the

and some codes are discovered that are better than direct product Reed Solomon
codes of similar length. Ruled surfaces over genus 1 curves are also studied,
but not all classes are completely analyzed. However, in this case a family of

of a Reed Solomon code and a Goppa code. Some further work is done on surfaces
from higher genus curves, but there remains much work to be done in this
direction to understand fully the resulting codes. Codes resulting from blowing

constructing infinite families of such codes.

However, by using a novel data structure called the Quantum Information
Decision Diagram (QuIDD) that exploits the structure of quantum operators, a
useful subset of operator matrices and state vectors can be represented in a
form that grows polynomially with the number of qubits. This subset contains,

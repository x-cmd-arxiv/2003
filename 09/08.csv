has indicated a possible time variation of the fine structure constant.
Alternatively, a constant value of alpha is consistent with the observational
analysis if a non-solar isotopic ratio of Mg24,25,26 occurs at high redshift.
In particular, a higher abundance of the heavier isotopes Mg25,26 are required
to explain the observed multiplet splitting. We show that the synthesis of
Mg25,26 at the base of the convective envelope in low-metallicity asymptotic
giant branch stars, combined with a simple model of galactic chemical
evolution, can produce the required isotopic ratios and is supported by recent
observations of high abundances of the neutron-rich Mg isotopes in metal-poor
globular-cluster stars. We conclude that the present data based on high
redshift quasar absorption spectra may be providing interesting information on
the nucleosynthetic history of such systems, rather than a time variation of
fundamental constants.

Oscillations of STars) will provide the first opportunity to measure the
albedos and scattered light curves from known short-period extrasolar planets.
Due to the changing phases of an extrasolar planet as it orbits its parent
star, the combined light of the planet-star system will vary on the order of
tens of micromagnitudes. The amplitude and shape of the resulting light curve
is sensitive to the planet's radius and orbital inclination, as well as the
composition and size distribution of the scattering particles in the planet's
atmosphere.
  To predict the capabilities of MOST and other planned space missions, we have
constructed a series of models of such light curves, improving upon earlier
work by incorporating more realistic details such as: limb darkening of the
star, intrinsic granulation noise in the star itself, tidal distortion and
back-heating, higher angular resolution of the light scattering from the
planet, and exploration of the significance of the angular size of the star as
seen from the planet. We use photometric performance simulations of the MOST
satellite, with the light curve models as inputs, for one of the mission's
primary targets, $\tau$ Bo\""otis. These simulations demonstrate that, even
adopting a very conservative signal detection limit of 4.2 $\mu$mag in
amplitude (not power), we will be able to either detect the $\tau$ Bo\""otis
planet light curve or put severe constraints on possible extrasolar planet
atmospheric models.

extended nature of the ADC, with radial extent varying from 20,000 km in the
faintest sources to 700,000 km in the brightest, a substantial fraction of the
accretion disc radius, typically 15%. This result rules out the Eastern model
for LMXB which is extensively used, in which the Comptonizing region is a small
central region. The ADC size depends strongly on the 1 - 30 keV source
luminosity via a simple relationship r_ADC = L^{0.88 +/- 0.16} (99% confidence)
close to a simple proportionality. We also present limited evidence that the
ADC size agrees with the Compton radius r_C, or maximum radius for hydrostatic
equilibrium. The results are consistent with models in which an extended ADC is
formed by illumination of the disc by the central source. The dependence on
luminosity may reflect the known decrease of coronal temperature as the source
luminosity increases leading to an increase of r_C. The extended nature of the
ADC means that the seed photons for Comptonization must consist of emission
from the disc to the same radial extent as the corona, providing copious
supplies of soft seed photons. We demonstrate the importance of the size of the
ADC to the correct description of Comptonization, and derive the Comptonized
spectrum of a LMXB based on thermal Comptonization of these seed photons and
show that this differs fundamentally from that of the Eastern model which
assumes a cut-off below 1 keV. Finally, we argue that our results are
inconsistent with the assumption often made that the X-ray emission of
accreting Black Holes and Neutron Stars has a common mechanism depending on the
properties of the accretion flow only.

measurement precision achieved is a few milliarcseconds per year, corresponding
to a few tens of kilometers per second for a pulsar a kiloparsec away. While
our results compare well with higher-precision measurements done using
very-long baseline interferometry, we find that several earlier proper motion
surveys appear to have reported overly optimistic measurement uncertainties,
most likely because of a failure to fully account for ionospheric effects. We
discuss difficulties inherent in estimating pulsar velocities from proper
motions given poorly constrained pulsar distances. Our observations favor a
distribution with 20% of pulsars in a low velocity component (sigma_1D = 99
km/s) and 80% in a high velocity component (sigma_1D = 294 km/s). Furthermore,
our sample is consistent with a scale height of pulsar birthplaces comparable
to the scale height of the massive stars that are their presumed progenitors.
No evidence is found in our data for a significant population of young pulsars
born far from the plane. We find that estimates of pulsar ages based on
kinematics agree well with the canonical spin-down age estimate, but agreement
is improved if braking indexes are drawn from a Gaussian distribution centered

dusty post-starburst phase. We also investigate the impact of structure of the
dusty medium and dust amount on the observed optical/near-IR colours of high-z

dust/stars configuration and an extinction function calibrated with nearby
dusty starbursts. As a main result, we find that dusty post-starburst galaxies

confirm, in agreement with PM00, that DSGs are well separated from Es, both at
1 < z < 2, in the Ic-K vs. J-K colour--colour diagram, whatever the structure
(two-phase clumpy or homogeneous) of their dusty medium and their dust amount
are. This result holds under the new hypothesis of high-z Es being as dusty as
nearby ones. Thus the interpretation of the optical/near-IR colours of high-z
Es may suffer from a multiple degeneracy among age, metallicity, dust and
redshift. We also find that DPSGs at z around 1 mix with DSGs at 1 < z < 2, as
a function of dust amount and structure of the dusty medium. All these results

absorption minima at -700 km/s; (ii) broad emission lines with BVZI ~4000 km/s;
(iii) broad wings most apparent in H-alpha. These components are identified
with the expanding circumstellar (CS) envelope (Sollerman, Cumming & Lundqvist
1998), shocked cool gas in the forward postshock region, and multiple Thomson
scattering in the CS envelope, respectively. The absence of broad P Cygni lines
from the supernova (SN) is the result of the formation of an optically thick,
cool, dense shell at the interface of the ejecta and the CS envelope. Models of
the SN deceleration and Thomson scattering wings are used to recover the
Thomson optical depth of the CS envelope and its radial extent, 4E15 cm. The
light curve, which we reproduce by a hydrodynamical model, is powered by a
combination of internal energy leakage after the explosion of an extended
presupernova (~1E15 cm) and luminosity from circumstellar interaction. We
recover the pre-explosion kinematics of the CS envelope and find it to be close
to homologous expansion with outmost velocity ~1100 km/s and a kinematic age of

that the CS envelope was explosively ejected only a few years before explosion.

unambiguously identified with different stages of the horizontal branch stellar
evolution. Stars close to the zero age horizontal branch (ZAHB) show Oosterhoff
I type properties, while the brightest stars have Oosterhoff II type statistics
regarding their mean periods and RRab/RRc number ratios. This finding
strengthens the earlier suggestion of Lee et al. (1990) connecting the
Oosterhoff dichotomy to evolutionary effects, however, it is unexpected to find
large samples of both of the Oosterhoff type within a single cluster, which is,
moreover, the prototype of the Oosterhoff I class globular clusters. The very
slight difference between the Fourier parameters of the stars (at a given
period) in the three fainter samples spanning over about 0.15 mag range in M_V
points to the limitations of any empirical methods which aim to determine
accurate absolute magnitudes of RR Lyrae stars solely from the Fourier
parameters of the light curves.

X-ray lightcurve with a period of 1.7+-0.2 hours, consistent with the period of
1.85 hours found before. However, no (partial) eclipses were found. We argue
that if the X-ray flare observed in earlier X-ray observations was a type I
X-ray burst then the source can only be an Accretion Disc Corona source at a
distance between ~11-24 kpc (implying a height above the Galactic disk of ~8-17
kpc). It has also been proposed in the literature that MS1603.76+2600 is a
dipper at ~75 kpc. We argue that in this dipper scenario the observed optical
properties of MS1603.6+2600 are difficult to reconcile with the optical
properties one would expect on the basis of comparisons with other high
inclination low-mass X-ray binaries, unless the X-ray flare was not a type I

accreting at a quiescent rate as was proposed by Hakala et al.(1998) or a high

photosphere through an interwoven web of flux, embodies a scale-free network.
It arises from a self-organized critical dynamics including flux emergence, the
diffusion and merging of magnetic concentrations, as well as avalanches of
reconnecting flux tubes. Magnetic concentrations such as fragments, pores and
sunspots, are `nodes' joined by flux tubes or `links'. The number of links
emanating from a node is scale-free. We reanalyze the quiet-Sun data of Close
et al and show that the distribution of magnetic concentration strengths is a
power law with an index $\gamma= 1.7 \pm 0.3$, over the entire range of the
measurement, about $(2-500)\times 10^{17}$ Mx. This distribution is compatible
with that for the sizes of active regions reported by Harvey and Schwaan. Thus
magnetic concentrations may be scale-free from the smallest measurable
fragments to the large active regions. Numerical simulations of a
self-organized critical model give the same index $\gamma$, within statistical
uncertainty. The exponential distribution of flux tube lengths also agrees
quantitatively with results from the model. Calibration with the measured
diffusion constant of magnetic concentrations allows us to calculate a flux
turnover time in the model to be of order 10 hours and the total solar flux to
be of order $10^{23}$Mx, agreeing with observations. We introduce two other
statistical quantities to characterize scale-free networks. The probability
distribution for the amount of flux connecting a pair of concentrations, and
the number of distinct concentrations linked to a given one are predicted to be
scale-free, with different indices. Our approach unifies the observation of
scale free flare energies with the coronal magnetic field structure.

distance to STS galaxies are shorter by -0.178mag. and -0.108mag. on average
again when using the LMC and Galaxy PL relations, respectively. We also
calculate the distance to these galaxies using PL relations at maximum light

correcting for metallicity effects, the difference between the distance moduli

temperature profiles decline roughly as the inverse of the distance from the

mergers seem to be ruled out as the dominant r-process source, since their low
rates of occurrence would lead to r-process enrichment that is not consistent

reviews the application of such tests to current datasets. The key lengths of

the total matter density and its ratio to the relativistic density; acoustic
oscillations can diagnose whether the matter is collisionless, and small-scale
structure or its absence can limit the mass of any dark-matter relic particle.
The most stringent constraints come from combining data on present-day galaxy
clustering with data on CMB anisotropies. Such an analysis breaks the
degeneracies inherent in either dataset alone, and proves that the universe is
very close to flat. The matter content is accurately consistent with pure Cold
Dark Matter, with about 25% of the critical density, and fluctuations that are

mechanical nature of the fluctuations. Forementioned universality manifests
itself through power-law behaviours of the response functions. Candidates are
found both in heavy fermion systems and in the cuprate high Tc superconductors.
Although there are indications for quantum criticality in the cuprate
superconductors, the reality and the physical nature of such a QPT are still
under debate. Here we identify a universal behaviour of the phase angle of the
frequency dependent conductivity that is characteristic of the quantum critical
region. We demonstrate that the experimentally measured phase angle agrees

one-magnon mode is decreased. In the singlet-dimer phase, the one-magnon mode
appears in $0 \leq q \leq q_c$. As the bond-alternation becomes strong, $q_c$
shifts towards $q=\pi$. In the antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic bond-alternation
region with a strong ferromagnetic coupling, the lowest excited states form the
lower edge of the multimagnon continuum in $0 \leq q \leq 0.2\pi$ and $0.8\pi
\leq q \leq \pi$, and the one-magnon mode appears in $0.2\pi<q<0.8\pi$. The
largest integrated intensity of the one-magnon mode is 93%, which is slightly
smaller than that in the S=1 Haldane-gap system. We further discuss the
dynamical structural factor in connection with the inelastic neutron-scattering
experiments.

stable quantized gravitational bound states of primordial black holes called
Holeums. The latter come in four varieties: ordinary Holeums H, Black Holeums
BH, Hyper Holeums HH and the massless Lux Holeums LH.These Holeums are
invisible because the gravitational radiation emitted by their quantum
transitions is undetectable now. The copiously produced Holeums form an
important component of the dark matter and the Lux Holeums an important
component of the dark energy in the universe. A segregation property puts the
Holeums mainly in the galactic haloes (GH) and the domain walls (DW) explaining
the latters' invisibility now. Cosmic rays (CR) are produced by two exploding
black holes created in a pressure-ionization of a stable Holeum. Our prediction
that more CRs will be emitted by the haloes than by the discs of galaxies
already has a strong empirical support. The concentration of the Hs and the HHs
in the GHs and the DWs lead to the formation of Holeum-stars emitting the CRs
and the gravitational waves(GW).Innumerable explosions of BHs at the time of
decoupling of gravity from the other interactions lead to inflation and baryon
asymmetry. A substantial cosmic back ground of matter and GWs and an

for binary neutron stars just prior to the merger. We assume a polytropic
equation of state and compute several evolutionary sequences of binary systems
composed of different-mass stars as well as identical-mass stars with adiabatic
indices gamma=2.5, 2.25, 2, and 1.8. From our results, we propose as a
conjecture that if the turning point of binding energy (and total angular
momentum) locating the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is found in
Newtonian gravity for some value of the adiabatic index gamma_0, that of the
ADM mass (and total angular momentum) should exist in the IWM approximation of
general relativity for the same value of the adiabatic index.

upper bound on the solar antineutrino flux, 2) the prediction of their energy

or observables including F-terms preserve part of supersymmetry. In this
article, we investigate the ring structure whose product is defined by the
supersymmetric star product. We find the ring whose elements correspond to 1/2
SUSY F-terms. Using this, the 1/2 SUSY invariance of the Wess-Zumino model is
shown easily and directly.

the warped-product metric ansatz for (n+1)-dimensional Einstein spaces, and a

Gamma, an arbitrary Gamma-set, and an arbitrary covering space of a connected

natural and simple geometric origin in the context of locally constant
G-equivariant maps from G-principal bundles over covering spaces of Sigma to
the G-manifold M. We calculate generating functions of orbifold Euler
characteristic of symmetric products of orbifolds associated to arbitrary
surface groups (orientable or non-orientable, compact or non-compact), in both
an exponential form and in an infinite product form. Geometrically, each factor
of this infinite product corresponds to an isomorphism class of a connected
covering space of a manifold Sigma. The essential ingredient for the
calculation is a structure theorem of the centralizer of homomorphisms into
wreath products described in terms of automorphism groups of Gamma-equivariant
G-principal bundles over finite Gamma-sets. As corollaries, we obtain many
identities in combinatorial group theory. As a byproduct, we prove a simple
formula which calculates the number of conjugacy classes of subgroups of given
index in any group. Our investigation is motivated by orbifold conformal field
theory.

small external force, harmonically dependent on time, can acquire a strange
attractor with properties similar to that of the canonical distribution - the
Gibbs attractor. The evolution of the energy in such systems can be described
as the energy diffusion. For the nonlinear Pullen - Edmonds oscillator with two
degrees of freedom the properties of the Gibbs attractor and their dependence
on parameters of the perturbation are studied both analytically and
numerically.

small molecular diffusivity and velocity field regularized at short scales to
mimic the effects of viscosity. As noted in ref.[5], removing those two
regularizations in two opposite orders for intermediate values of
compressibility gives Lagrangian flows with quite different properties.
Removing the viscous regularization before diffusivity leads to the explosive
separation of trajectories of fluid particles whereas turning the
regularizations off in the opposite order results in coalescence of Lagrangian
trajectories. In the present paper we re-examine the situation first addressed
in ref.[6] in which the Prandtl number is varied when the regularizations are
removed. We show that an appropriate fine-tuning leads to a sticky behavior of
trajectories which hit each other on and off spending a positive amount of time
together. We examine the effect of such a trajectory behavior on the passive
transport showing that it induces anomalous scaling of the stationary 2-point
structure function of an advected tracer and influences the rate of
condensation of tracer energy in the zero wavenumber mode.

mometum dissipations in fully damped deep inelastic collisions have been
estimated assming exit channel configuration similar to those for

dissipations are more than those predicted by the empirical sticking limit in
all cases. The deviation is found to increase with increasing charge transfer
(lighter fragments). Qualitatively, this may be due to stronger friction in the
exit channel. Moreover, for the heavier system $^{20}$Ne + $^{59}$Co, the
overall magnitude of deviation is less as compared to those for the lighter
systems, {\it i.e.}, $^{16}$O + $^{27}$Al, $^{28}$Si, $^{20}$Ne + $^{27}$Al.
This may be due to lesser overlap in time scales of fusion and deep inelastic
time scales for heavier systems.

it turnes out that there is effectively only one counter-term relevant to this

reproduce the experimental value of the tritium-beta decay. Our study has also
led to {\em very} accurate EFT calculations on two-body weak processes that

that the GHZ scheme does not imply a contradiction between the local realism

that (well known in probability theory) singularity/absolute continuity

We carry out a more detailed analysis of the WMAP first-year data, deriving

such as the possible hints for the running of the spectral index. We find, at
95% C.L. that $0.95 < \alpha_{\text{dec}} / \alpha_0 < 1.02$. Setting $dn_S
/dlnk=0$, yields $0.94< \alpha_{\text{dec}} / \alpha_0 < 1.01$ as previously
reported. We find that a lower value of $\alpha / \alpha_0$ makes a value of $d
n_S /dlnk = 0$ more compatible with the data. We also perform a thorough Fisher
Matrix Analysis (including both temperature and polarization, as well as
$\alpha$ and the optical depth $\tau$), in order to estimate how future CMB
experiments will be able to constrain $\alpha$ and other cosmological
parameters. We find that Planck data alone can constrain $\tau$ with a accuracy
of the order 4% and that this constraint can be as small as 1.7% for an ideal
cosmic variance limited experiment. Constraints on $\alpha$ are of the order
0.3% for Planck and can in principle be as small as 0.1% using CMB data alone -
tighter constraints will require further (non-CMB) priors.

high energy spectral component extending from $\lesssim$ a few MeV to $\gtrsim$
200 MeV, in addition to the typical GRB emission which peaked at $\lesssim$ a
few hundred keV. The high energy component carried at least $\sim$ 3 times more
energy than the lower energy component. It displayed an almost constant flux
with a rather hard spectrum ($F_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \sim
0$) from $\lesssim$ 20 s into the burst up to $\sim$ 200 s, while the duration
of the GRB, where 90% of the energy in the lower energy component was emitted,
was only 77 s. Such a high energy component was seen in only one out of $\sim$
30 GRBs in which a similar component could have been detected, and thus appears
to be quite rare. We examine possible explanations for this high energy
spectral component and find that most models fail. The only emission region
that provides the right temporal behavior is the reverse shock that goes into
the GRB ejecta as it is decelerated by the ambient medium, or possibly the very
early forward shock while the reverse shock is still going on. The best
candidate for the emission mechanism is synchrotron self-Compton emission from
the reverse shock. Even in this model the most natural spectral slope is only
marginally consistent with the observed value, and some degree of fine tuning
is required in order to improve the agreement. This might suggest that an
additional or alternative emission mechanism is at work here. A prediction of
this interpretation is that such a high energy component should be accompanied
by a bright optical transient, similar to the one observed in GRB 990123.

the ratio of the rotation velocity to the central line width, against the
expected distribution for galaxies with random inclination angles, modelled as
singular isothermal spheres. The model fits the data well. On this basis we
argue that the central line width provides a predictor of the circular velocity
at a radius of several kpc. Assembling a larger sample of LBGs with measured
line widths, we compare these results against the theoretical Lambda-CDM
rotation curves of Mo, Mao & White, under the hypothesis that LBGs mark the
centres of the most massive dark matter halos. We find that the circular
velocities are over-predicted by a substantial factor, which we estimate
conservatively as 1.8+/-0.4. This indicates that the model is probably
incorrect. The model of LBGs as relatively low-mass starburst systems, of
Somerville, Primack, and Faber (2001), provides a good fit to the data.

condense into planetesimals. Super-solar metallicities result if solid

Previous analyses of aerodynamic drift rates that account for mean flow
differences between gas and particles yield particle pile-ups. We improve on
these studies not only by accounting for the collective inertia of solids
relative to that of gas, but also by including the transport of angular
momentum by turbulent stresses within the particle layer. These turbulent
stresses are derived in a physically self-consistent manner from the structure
of marginally Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulent flows. They are not calculated using
the usual plate drag formulae, whose use we explain is inappropriate.
Accounting for the relative inertia of solids to gas retards, but does not
prevent, particle pile-ups, and generates more spatially extended regions of
metal enrichment. Turbulent transport hastens pile-ups. We conclude that
particle pile-up is a robust outcome in sufficiently passive protoplanetary
disks. Connections to observations of circumstellar disks, including the Kuiper

maintain simultaneous apsidal and nodal lock. Ring self-gravity, interparticle
collisions, and the quadrupole field of the host planet balance each other to
achieve this equilibrium. We prove that such an equilibrium is linearly stable.
Predictions for the Saturnian ringlets to be tested by the Cassini spacecraft

should increase from ring midline to ring edges, and (3) rings are vertically
warped such that the fractional variation of inclination across the ring is of

apsidal and nodal locking forces the narrowest portion of the ring--its
``pinch,'' where self-gravitational and collisional forces are strongest--to
circulate relative to the node, and introduces previously unrecognized
time-varying forces perpendicular to the planet's equator plane. We speculate

occupation is consistent with resonant capture and adiabatic excitation by a
migratory Neptune; however, the dynamically cold initial conditions prior to
resonance sweeping that are typically assumed by migration simulations are
probably inadequate. Given the dynamically hot residents of the 5:2 MMR and the
substantial inclinations observed in all exterior MMRs, a fraction of the
primordial belt was likely dynamically pre-heated prior to resonance sweeping.
A pre-heated population may have arisen as Neptune gravitationally scattered
objects into trans-Neptunian space. The spatial distribution of Twotinos offers
a unique diagnostic of Neptune's migration history. The Neptunian Trojan
population may rival the Jovian Trojan population, and the former's existence
is argued to rule out violent orbital histories for Neptune. Finally,
lowest-order secular theory is applied to several hundred non-resonant KBOs

improved statistics can only come from combining data from many clusters. We
also examine the luminosity-density and number-density profiles as a function
of morphology and draw the following conclusions: (1) The galaxies responsible
for the steep faint-end slope are predominantly of late-type morphology, (2)
The cluster core is dominated by elliptical galaxies, (3) The core is devoid of
late-types systems, (4) The luminosity-density as a function of morphological
type is skewed towards early-types when compared to the field, (5) Up to half
of the elliptical galaxies may have formed from the spiral population through

subsonic flow region and here the accreting fluid has been treated as nearly
incompressible. It has been shown here that the coupling of the mean flow and
the turbulent fluctuations, gives rise to a scaling relation for an effective
""turbulent viscosity"". This in turn leads to a dynamic scaling for sound
propagation in the accretion process. As a consequence of this scaling, the
sonic horizon of the transonic inflow solution is shifted inwards, in
comparison with the inviscid flow.

also compared different shapes for the intrinsic rotation curve. To gain robust

evidence for a mass-dependent luminosity evolution which is as large as up to 2
mag for the lowest-mass galaxies, but is small or even negligible for the

z~0.5 in comparison to the local sample. We argue for a mass-dependent

Together with SN 1997D, we show that they form a group of exceptionally
low-luminosity events. These SNe have narrow spectral lines (indicating low
expansion velocities) and low luminosities at every phase (significantly lower
than those of typical core-collapse supernovae). The very low luminosity during
the ^{56}Co radioactive decay tail indicates that the mass of ^{56}Ni ejected
during the explosion is much smaller (M(Ni) ~ 2-8 x 10^{-3} Mo) than the
average (M(Ni) ~ 6-10 x 10^{-2} Mo). Two supernovae of this group (SN 1999br
and SN 2001dc) were discovered very close to the explosion epoch, allowing us
to determine the lengths of their plateaux (~ 100 days) as well as
establishiing the explosion epochs of the other, less-completely observed SNe.
It is likely that this group of SNe represent the extreme low-luminosity tail
of a single continuous distribution of SN II-P events. Their kinetic energy is
also exceptionally low. Although an origin from low mass progenitors has also
been proposed for low-luminosity core-collapse SNe, recent work provides
evidence in favour of the high mass progenitor scenario. The incidence of these
low--luminosity SNe could be as high as 4-5$ $ of all type II SNe.

while the young and intermediate stars are more concentrated in the central

exclude the presence of long quiescent phases between the episodes during the
last ~1 Gyr. The central regions experienced an episode of star formation of
\~0.07 Msun/yr (for a Salpeter initial mass function [IMF]) 15 to 10 Myr ago.
This coincides with the strong activity in the central super star cluster. We
find a rate of ~0.3 Msun/yr for the youngest ongoing burst which started ~3 Myr
ago. This is higher than in other dwarfs and comparable to the rate of NGC
1569. The star formation rate of earlier episodes is not especially high and

Cl0303+1706 (z=0.42), and Cl0413-6559 (F1557.19TC) (z=0.51). Out of 30 cluster
members with emission-lines, 13 galaxies exhibit a rotation curve of the
universal form rising in the inner region and passing over into a flat part.
The other members have either intrinsically peculiar kinematics (4), or too
strong geometric distortions (9) or too low S/N (4 galaxies) for a reliable
classification of their velocity profiles. The 13 cluster galaxies for which a
maximum rotation velocity could be derived are distributed in the Tully--Fisher
diagram very similar to field galaxies from the FORS Deep Field that have
corresponding redshifts and do not show any significant luminosity evolution
with respect to local samples. The same is true for seven galaxies observed in
the cluster fields that turned out not to be members. The mass-to-light ratios
of the 13 TF cluster spirals cover the same range as the distant field
population indicating that their stellar populations were not dramatically
changed by possible clusterspecific interaction phenomena. The cluster members
with distorted kinematics may be subject to interaction processes but it is
impossible to determine whether these processes also lead to changes in the
overall luminosity of their stellar populations.

the crystal lattice with wavevector $\bQ_c$ results in a corresponding
modulation of the exchange interaction which, in the leading order, is
parametrized by no more than two constants per bond, and perturbs the spin
Hamiltonian by adding the ``Umklapp'' terms $\sim S^\alpha_{\bq} S^\alpha_{\bq
\pm \bQ_c}$. As a result, for a general spin-spiral ground state of the
non-perturbed exchange Hamiltonian, an incommensurate shift of the propagation
vector, $\bQ$, and additional new magnetic Bragg peaks, at $\bQ \pm n\bQ_c$, $n
= 1,2,...$, appear, and its energy is lowered as it adapts to the exchange
modulation. Consequently, the lattice distortion may open a region of stability
of the incommensurate spiral phase which otherwise does not win the competition
with the collinear N\'{e}el state. Such is the case for the frustrated
square-lattice antiferromagnet. In addition, the ``Umklapp'' terms provide a
commensuration mechanism, which may lock the spin structure to the lattice
modulation vector $\bQ_c$, if there is sufficient easy-axis anisotropy, or a
magnetic field in an easy plane.

permitted. The partition function is obtained by combining microscopic free
energies of individual constraints using network rigidity as an underlying
long-range mechanical interaction -- giving a quantitative explanation for the
non-additivity in component entropies exhibited in molecular systems. Two
exactly solved 2-dimensional toy models representing flexible molecules that
can undergo conformational change are presented to elucidate concepts, and to
outline a DCM calculation scheme applicable to many types of physical systems.
It is proposed that network rigidity plays a central role in balancing the
energetic and entropic contributions to the free energy of bio-polymers, such
as proteins. As a demonstration, the distance constraint model is solved
exactly for the alpha-helix to coil transition in homogeneous peptides.
Temperature and size independent model parameters are fitted to Monte Carlo
simulation data, which includes peptides of length 10 for gas phase, and
lengths 10, 15, 20 and 30 in water. The DCM is compared to the Lifson-Roig
model. It is found that network rigidity provides a mechanism for cooperativity
in molecular structures including their ability to spontaneously self-organize.
In particular, the formation of a characteristic topological arrangement of
constraints is associated with the most probable microstates changing under
different thermodynamic conditions.

documents are related to keyterms. The distance functions computed from these
relations establish associative networks among items of the DN, referred to as
Distance Graphs, which allow recommendation systems to identify relevant
associations for individual users. However, modern recommendation systems need
to integrate associative data from multiple sources such as different
databases, web sites, and even other users. Thus, we are presented with a
problem of combining evidence (about associations between items) from different
sources characterized by distance functions. In this paper we describe our work
on (1) inferring relevant associations from, as well as characterizing,
semi-metric distance graphs and (2) combining evidence from different distance
graphs in a recommendation system. Regarding (1), we present the idea of
semi-metric distance graphs, and introduce ratios to measure semi-metric

web sites and show that they are useful to identify implicit associations.
Regarding (2), we describe an algorithm to combine evidence from distance
graphs that uses Evidence Sets, a set structure based on Interval Valued Fuzzy
Sets and Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence. This algorithm has been developed
for a recommendation system named TalkMine.

  context; clarifies some conceptual issues; 24 pages; revtex",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph hep-th",,"  In any space-time, it is possible to have a family of observers who have
access to only part of the space-time manifold, because of the existence of a
horizon. We demand that \emph{physical theories in a given coordinate system
must be formulated entirely in terms of variables that an observer using that
coordinate system can access}. In the coordinate frame in which these observers
are at rest, the horizon manifests itself as a (coordinate) singularity in the
metric tensor. Regularization of this singularity removes the inaccessible
region, and leads to the following consequences: (a) The non-trivial
topological structure for the effective manifold allows one to obtain the
standard results of quantum field theory in curved space-time. (b) In case of
gravity, this principle requires that the effect of the unobserved degrees of
freedom should reduce to a boundary contribution $A_{\rm boundary}$ to the
gravitational action. When the boundary is a horizon, $A_{\rm boundary}$
reduces to a single, well-defined term proportional to the area of the horizon.
Using the form of this boundary term, it is possible to obtain the full
gravitational action in the semiclassical limit. (c) This boundary term must
have a quantized spectrum with uniform spacing, $\Delta
A_{boundary}=2\pi\hbar$, in the semiclassical limit. This, in turn, yields the
following results for semiclassical gravity: (i) The area of any one-way
membrane is quantized. (ii) The information hidden by a one-way membrane
amounts to an entropy, which is always one-fourth of the area of the membrane
in the leading order. (iii) In static space-times, the action for gravity can
be given a purely thermodynamic interpretation and the Einstein equations have
a formal similarity to laws of thermodynamics.

Its consequences are addressed and their accuracy qualified. It is suggested
that theory-wise B->D \ell\nu near zero recoil offers an accurate alternative
way to measure |V_{cb}|. It is shown that the OPE is in a good standing when
confronted by experiment. The alleged controversy between theory and data on
certain decay channels is found to be an artefact of oversimplifying the OPE in
presence of high experimental cuts severely degrading the effective hardness.
The effects exponential in the latter are missed in the traditionally used
expressions, yet they do not signify a breakdown of the 1/m_b expansion proper.
They typically increase the apparent b quark mass in B->X_s+\gamma by 70 MeV or
more, together with an even more dramatic downward shift in the kinetic
expectation value. The utility of the second moment of E_\gamma is emphasized
once the aforementioned effects have been included. Incorporating them brings
different measurements into a good agreement, provided the OPE-based theory

between matter and antimatter, based on nonperturbative QCD physics. This
scenario relies on a mechanism of separation of quarks and antiquarks in two
coexisting phases at the end of the cosmological QCD phase transition: ordinary
hadrons (and antihadrons), along with massive lumps (and antilumps) of novel
color superconducting phase. The latter would serve as the cosmological cold
dark matter. In certain conditions the separation of charge is C and CP
asymmetric and can leave a net excess of hadrons over antihadrons in the
conventional phase, even if the visible universe is globally baryon symmetric
$B = 0$. In this case an equal, but negative, overall baryon charge must be
hidden in the lumps of novel phase. Due to the small volume occupied by these
dense lumps/antilumps of color superconducting phase and the specific features
of their interaction with ""normal"" matter in hadronic phase, this scenario does
not contradict the current phenomenological constrains on presence of
antimatter in the visible universe. Moreover, in this scenario the observed
cosmological ratio $\Omega_{DM}\sim\Omega_{B}$ within an order of magnitude
finds a natural explanation, as both contributions to $\Omega$ originated from
the same physics during the QCD phase transition. The baryon to entropy ratio
$n_{B}/n_{\gamma}\sim 10^{-10}$ would also be a natural outcome, fixed by the
temperature $T_f \simlt T_{QCD}$ at which the separation of phases is
completed.

of states and the partitioning of an integer in number theory. For $N$ bosons
in a one dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, it is well known that the
asymptotic (N -> infinity) density of states is identical to the
Hardy-Ramanujan formula for the partitions p(n), of a number n into a sum of
integers. We show that the same statistical mechanics technique for the density
of states of bosons in a power-law spectrum yields the partitioning formula for
p^s(n), the latter being the number of partitions of n into a sum of s-th
powers of a set of integers. By making an appropriate modification of the
statistical technique, we are also able to obtain d^s(n) for distinct
partitions. We find that the distinct square partitions d^2(n) show pronounced
oscillations as a function of n about the smooth curve derived by us. The
origin of these oscillations from the quantum point of view is discussed. After
deriving the Erdos-Lehner formula for restricted partitions for the $s=1$ case

of family of discrete (infinite-dimensional) vector spaces. The author
introduces a notion of family of Tate spaces (""Tate"" means ""locally linearly
compact"") and claims that it is local. The definition takes in account that the
K_{-1} of a ring is not necessarily zero. However, we prove that K_{-1} always
vanishes after Nisnevich sheafification. As a discrete counterpart of families
of Tate spaces, we introduce the notion of almost projective module. We discuss
the notions of dimension torsor and determinant gerbe of a family of Tate
spaces.
  The above technique has two different applications.
  First, we clarify the structure of the ind-scheme of formal loops of a smooth
affine manifold Y. This allows to define a ""refined"" motivic integral of a
differential form on Y with no zeros, which is an object of a triangulated
category rather than an element of its K_0 group.
  Second, we show that almost projective modules and families of Tate spaces
appear naturally in the study of the cohomology of a family of
finite-dimensional vector bundles on a punctured smooth manifold. The canonical
central extension that comes from this cohomology allows to interpret the
""Uhlenbeck compactification"" of the stack of vector bundles on the projective
plane as the fine moduli space of a certain type of generalized vector bundles.

reciprocal on the dual graph is also non-crossing. We give a complete
description of the self-stresses on non-crossing frameworks whose reciprocals
are non-crossing, in terms of: the types of faces (only pseudo-triangles and
pseudo-quadrangles are allowed); the sign patterns in the self-stress; and a
geometric condition on the stress vectors at some of the vertices.
  As in other recent papers where the interplay of non-crossingness and
rigidity of straight-line plane graphs is studied, pseudo-triangulations show
up as objects of special interest. For example, it is known that all planar
Laman circuits can be embedded as a pseudo-triangulation with one non-pointed
vertex. We show that if such an embedding is sufficiently generic, then the
reciprocal is non-crossing and again a pseudo-triangulation embedding of a
planar Laman circuit. For a singular (i.e., non-generic) pseudo-triangulation
embedding of a planar Laman circuit, the reciprocal is still non-crossing and a
pseudo-triangulation, but its underlying graph may not be a Laman circuit.
Moreover, all the pseudo-triangulations which admit a non-crossing reciprocal
arise as the reciprocals of such, possibly singular, stresses on
pseudo-triangulation embeddings of Laman circuits.
  All self-stresses on a planar graph correspond to liftings to piece-wise
linear surfaces in 3-space. We prove characteristic geometric properties of the
lifts of such non-crossing reciprocal pairs.

based on the numerical continuation of solutions in one of the parameters of
the Ginzburg-Landau equation (the diffusion coefficient $c$), starting from the
nonlinear Schr\""odinger limit (for which $c=0$). The continuation generates,
recursively, a sequence of coexisting stable solutions with increasing number
of humps. The sequence ""converges"" to a long pulse which can be interpreted as
a bound state of two fronts with opposite polarities.

more than one frequency. Multimode operation in gas versus semiconductor lasers
arises from different physics. In gas lasers, slow equilibration of the
electron populations at different energies makes each frequency an independent
single-mode laser. The slow electron diffusion in semiconductor lasers,
combined with the spatially varying optical intensity patterns of the modes,
makes each region of space an independent single-mode laser. We develop a rate
equation model for the photon number in each mode which captures all these
effects. Plotting the photon number versus pumping rate for the competing
modes, in both subthreshold and above threshold operation, illustrates the
changes in the laser output spectrum due to either slow equilibration or slow

overlapping laser pulses it is possible to create any final superposition state

the relative phases of the applied pulses influence not only the phases of the
final superposition state but the probability amplitudes as well. We show that

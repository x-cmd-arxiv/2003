major mergers of galaxy dark matter haloes with density profiles having either
inner cusps or cores. Our simulations range from 2x10^5 to 10^7 particles,
allowing us to probe the phase-space distribution of dark matter particles in
the innermost regions (less than 0.005 virial radii) of cold dark matter
haloes, a subject of much recent debate. We find that a major merger of two
cored haloes yields a cored halo and does not result in a cuspy profile seen in
many cosmological simulations. This result is unchanged if we consider mergers
with parent mass ratios of 3:1 instead of 1:1. Mergers of a cuspy halo with
either a cored halo or a second cuspy halo of equal mass, on the other hand,
produce cuspy haloes with a slightly reduced inner logarithmic slope. Cuspy
haloes, once formed, therefore appear resilient to major mergers. We find the
velocity structure of the remnants to be mildly anisotropic, with a Maxwellian
velocity distribution near the centre but not in the outer portions of the
final haloes. Violent relaxation is effective only during the early phase of
mergers, with phase mixing likely to be the dominant relaxation process at late
times.

clumpy emission in the center of the remnant. The observed X-ray spectrum for
the central region is evidently dominated by emission from reverse shock-heated
metal-rich ejecta. Elemental abundances in this ejecta material are
particularly enhanced in oxygen and neon, while less prominent in the heavier

``oxygen-rich'' SNR, making it only the second member of the class in the SMC.
The outer shell is the limb-brightened, soft X-ray emission from the swept-up
SMC interstellar medium. The presence of O-rich ejecta and the SNR's location
within an H{\small II} region attest to a massive star core-collapse origin for
0103$-$72.6. The elemental abundance ratios derived from the ejecta suggest an

alpha. We have compared its evolution inside virialised overdensities with that
in the cosmological background, using the standard ($% \Lambda =0$) $CDM$ model
of structure formation and the dark-energy modification, $wCDM$. We find that,
independently of the model of structure formation one considers, there is
always a difference between the value of alpha in an overdensity and in the
background. In a $SCDM$ model, this difference is the same, independent of the
virialisation redshift of the overdense region. In the case of a $wCDM$ model,
especially at low redshifts, the difference depends on the time when
virialisation occurs and the equation of state of the dark energy. At high
redshifts, when the $wCDM$ model becomes asymptotically equivalent to the
$SCDM$ one, the difference is constant. At low redshifts, when dark energy
starts to dominate the cosmological expansion, the difference between alpha in
a cluster and in the background grows. The inclusion of the effects of
inhomogeneity leads naturally to no observable local time variations of alpha
on Earth and in our Galaxy even though time variations can be significant on
quasar scales. The inclusion of the effects of inhomogeneous cosmological
evolution are necessary if terrestrial and solar-system bounds on the time
variation of the fine structure 'constant' are to be correctly compared with
extragalactic data.

of this constraint on the ionizing background due to quasars in the early

seriously, possibly challenging models of black hole formation.

follow the evolution of a 0.33 Msun white dwarf remnant in a self-consistent
way with the predictions of nuclear burning, element diffusion and the history
of the white dwarf progenitor. Attention is focused on the occurrence of
hydrogen shell flashes induced by diffusion processes during cooling phases.
The evolutionary stages prior to the white dwarf formation are also fully
accounted for by computing the conservative binary evolution of an initially
2.5-Msun Pop. I star with a 1.25 Msun companion, and period P_i= 3 days.
Evolution is followed down to the domain of the ZZ Ceti stars on the white
dwarf cooling branch. We find that chemical diffusion induces the occurrence of
an additional hydrogen thermonuclear flash which leads to stellar models with
thin hydrogen envelopes. As a result, a fast cooling is encountered at advanced
stages of evolution. In addition, we explore the adiabatic pulsational
properties of the resulting white dwarf models. As compared with their
helium-core counterparts, low-mass oxygen-core white dwarfs are characterized
by a pulsational spectrum much more featured, an aspect which could eventually
be used for distinguishing both types of stars if low-mass white dwarfs were in
fact found to pulsate as ZZ Ceti-type variables. Finally, we perform a
non-adiabatic pulsational analysis on the resulting carbon/oxygen low-mass
white dwarf models.

This correlation originates from the fact that the low-multipole polarization

anisotropy, which depend primarily on the optical depth for electron scattering

electronic structure is substantially different from the closely related and
well known rutile half-metal CrO2. In particular, we find a smaller conduction
band width in the spinel compound, perhaps as a result of the distinct topology
of the spinel crystal structure, and the reduced oxidation state. The magnetism
and half-metallicity of LiCr2O4 has been mapped in the parameter space of its

the effectiveness of a nearly-rigid band picture involving simple shifts of the

  We consider the case that sparse data strongly suggest that the probabilities

in-degree \Delta. Then this simple law will also explain further data with high
confidence. This is shown by calculating bounds on the VC dimension of the set
of those probability measures that correspond to simple graphs. This allows to
select networks by structural risk minimization and gives reliability bounds on
the error of the estimated joint measure without (in contrast to a previous
paper) any prior assumptions on the set of possible joint measures.
  The complexity for searching the optimal Bayesian networks of in-degree
\Delta increases only polynomially in the number of random varibales for
constant \Delta and the optimal joint measure associated with a given graph can
be found by convex optimization.

  ""Tenth Marcel Grossmann Meeting on General Relativity"" (Rio de Janeiro, July
  20-26, 2003)",,,,"gr-qc hep-ph hep-th",,"  Each approach to the quantum-gravity problem originates from expertise in one
or another area of theoretical physics. The particle-physics perspective
encourages one to attempt to reproduce in quantum gravity as much as possible
of the successes of the Standard Model of particle physics, and therefore, as
done in String Theory, the core features of quantum gravity are described in
terms of graviton-like exchange in a background classical spacetime. From the
general-relativity perspective it is natural to renounce to any reference to a
background spacetime, and to describe spacetime in a way that takes into
account the in-principle limitations of measurements. The Loop Quantum Gravity
approach and the approaches based on noncommutative geometry originate from
this general-relativity perspective. The condensed-matter perspective, which
has been adopted in a few recent quantum-gravity proposals, naturally leads to
scenarios in which some familiar properties of spacetime are only emergent,
just like, for example, some emergent collective degrees of freedom are
relevant to the description of certain physical systems only near a critical
point. Both from the general-relativity perspective and from the
condensed-matter perspective it is natural to explore the possibility that
quantum gravity might have significant implications for the fate of Lorentz
symmetry in the Planckian regime. From the particle-physics perspective there
is instead no obvious reason to renounce to exact Lorentz symmetry, although
(``spontaneous'') Lorentz symmetry breaking is of course possible. A
fast-growing phenomenological programme looking for Planck-scale departures
from Lorentz symmetry can contribute to this ongoing debate.

action for fermionic systems featuring bosonic bound states (BBS) and
spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In a purely fermionic language proceeding
into the SSB phase requires techniques beyond perturbation theory and
renormalization group equations. Improvement comes from a description with BBS
fields and elementary fields treated on equal footing. Yet, ``partial
bosonization'' introduces an arbitrariness as the choice for the composite
fields is usually not completely determined by the classical action. Results of
approximate calculations, e.g. mean field theory, may depend strongly on this
choice, thus limiting their quantitative reliability. Using the
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model as an example we demonstrate how this dependence can
be reduced, sometimes even be eliminated by suitably chosen approximations.
  Schwinger-Dyson equations (SDE) allow for a description of SSB without
auxiliary fields. The 2PI effective action enables us to compare different
solutions of the SDE and find the stable one. We apply this method to a
six-fermion interaction resembling the three-flavor instanton interaction in
QCD. We find a first order chiral phase transition but no stable phase with
broken color symmetry.
  The existence of an elementary scalar boson in the Standard Model -- the
Higgs -- raises several questions. The smallness of its mass compared to some
fundamental scale ($\sim M_{\textrm{GUT}}$) requires an extreme amount of
fine-tuning. Moreover, its $\phi^4$-potential may not be renormalizable in a
strict sense. In view of this we discuss the possibility of a Higgs as BBS of
fermions.

problems (horizon, flatness, monopole,...), based on a modification of old
inflation. These models do not require a potential which satisfies the normal
inflationary slow-roll conditions. Our universe arises from a single tunneling
event as the inflaton leaves the false vacuum. Subsequent dynamics (arising
from either the oscillations of the inflaton field or thermal effects) keep a
second field trapped in a false minimum, resulting in an evanescent period of
inflation (with roughly 50 e-foldings) inside the bubble. This easily allows
the bubble to grow sufficiently large to contain our present horizon volume.
Reheating is accomplished when the inflaton driving the last stage of inflation
rolls down to the true vacuum, and adiabatic density perturbations arise from
moduli-dependent Yukawa couplings of the inflaton to matter fields. Our
scenario has several robust predictions, including virtual absence of gravity

symmetry of nature, but emerges as an accidental approximate global symmetry at
low energies. This can occur if the visible sector is non-supersymmetric at
high scales, but flows toward a strongly-coupled superconformal fixed point at
low energies; or, alternatively, if the visible sector is localized near the
infrared brane of a warped higher-dimensional spacetime with supersymmetry
broken only on the UV brane. These two scenarios are related by the AdS/CFT
correspondence. In order for supersymmetry to solve the hierarchy problem, the
conformal symmetry must be broken below 10^{11} GeV. Accelerated unification
can naturally explain the observed gauge coupling unification by physics below
the conformal breaking scale. In this framework, there is no gravitino and no
reason for the existence of gravitational moduli, thus eliminating the
cosmological problems associated with these particles. No special dynamics is
required to break supersymmetry; rather, supersymmetry is broken at observable
energies because the fixed point is never reached. In 4D language, this can be
due to irrelevant supersymmetry breaking operators with approximately equal
dimensions. In 5D language, the size of the extra dimension is stabilized by
massive bulk fields. No small input parameters are required to generate a large
hierarchy. Supersymmetry can be broken in the visible sector either through
direct mediation or by the F term of the modulus associated with the breaking
of conformal invariance.

eigenstates as well as the eigenvalues depend on the non-commutativity
parameter \theta. Focusing on the ground state wave function before the
transformation, we calculate the density matrix \rho_0(\theta) and find that
its traces {\rm Tr}(\rho_{0}(\theta)) and {\rm Tr}(\rho_0^2(\theta)) are not
affected by the non-commutativity. Evaluating the Wigner function on
\RR^2_{\theta} confirms this. The uncertainty relation is explicitly determined
and found to depend on \theta. For small values of \theta, the relation is
shifted by a \theta^2 term, which can be interpreted as a quantum correction.
The calculated entropy does not change with respect to the normal case. We
consider the limits \alpha=1 and \alpha={\pi\over 2}. In first case, by
identifying \theta to the squared magnetic length, one can recover basic

a pressure gradient. For a generally curving pipe it is the fluid flux which is
constant along the pipe and so I correct fluid flow solutions of Dean (1928)

straight, the fluid adopts the parabolic velocity profile of Poiseuille flow;
the spread of any contaminant along the pipe is then described by the shear
dispersion model of Taylor (1954) and its refinements by Mercer, Watt et al
(1994,1996). However, two conflicting effects occur in a generally curving
pipe: viscosity skews the velocity profile which enhances the shear dispersion;
whereas in faster flow centrifugal effects establish secondary flows that
reduce the shear dispersion. The two opposing effects cancel at a Reynolds
number of about 15. Interestingly, the torsion of the pipe seems to have very
little effect upon the flow or the dispersion, the curvature is by far the
dominant influence. Lastly, curvature and torsion in the fluid flow
significantly enhance the upstream tails of concentration profiles in

monitoring of the gross operational status of the reactor from outside the

burn cycle the total number of antineutrinos steadily drops and this variation
is quite detectable, assuming fixed reactor power. The average antineutrino
energy also steadily drops, and a measurement of this variation would be very
useful to help off set uncertainties in the total reactor power. However, the
expected change in the antineutrino signal from the diversion of a significant

expected, the behavior at early time regime, for the sample processes
considered, deviate significantly from diffusion theory; a fact with important

been optimized by instrument makers, the lowest twelfths remain slightly too
large (inharmonicity). In this article, we study the problem from two different
points of view. First, we systematically review various physical reasons why
this inharmonicity may take place, and the effect of different bore
perturbations inserted in cylindrical instruments. Applications to a real
clarinet resonator and comparisons with impedance measurements are then
presented. A commonly accepted idea is that the register hole is the dominant
cause for this inharmonicity: it is natural to expect that opening this hole
will raise the resonance frequencies of the instrument, except for the note for
which the hole is at the pressure node. We show that the real situation is
actually more complicated because other effects, such as open holes or bore
taper and bell, introduce resonance shifts that are comparable but with
opposite sign, so that a relatively good overall compensation takes place. The
origin of the observed inharmonicity in playing frequencies is therefore
different. In a second part, we use an elementary model of the clarinet in
order to isolate the effect of the register hole: a perfect cylindrical tube
without closed holes. Optimization techniques are then used to calculate an
optimum location for the register hole; the result turns out to be close to the
location chosen by clarinet makers. Finally, attempts are made numerically to
improve the situation by introducing small perturbations in the higher part of
the cylindrical resonator, but no satisfactory improvement is obtained.

of two coupled dissipative oscillators. The action of a classical driving field
on one of the oscillators is also analyzed. Master equations are derived for
both regimes of weakly and strongly interacting oscillators from which
interesting results arise concerning the coherence properties of the joint and
the reduced system states. The strong coupling regime is required to achieve a
large frequency shift of the oscillator normal modes, making it possible to
explore the whole profile of the spectral density of the reservoirs. We show
how the decoherence process may be controlled by shifting the normal mode
frequencies to regions of small spectral density of the reservoirs. Different
spectral densities of the reservoirs are considered and their effects on the
decoherence process are analyzed. For oscillators with different damping rates,
we show that the worse-quality system is improved and vice-versa, a result
which could be useful for quantum state protection. State recurrence and swap
dynamics are analyzed as well as their roles in delaying the decoherence
process.

Accepted for publication in Europhysics Letters","Europhysics Letters 64, 441 (2003)","10.1209/epl/i2003-00231-y",,"quant-ph nlin.CD",,"  Quantum trajectories defined in the de Broglie--Bohm theory provide a causal
way to interpret physical phenomena. In this Letter, we use this formalism to
analyze the short time dynamics induced by unstable periodic orbits in a
classically chaotic system, a situation in which scars are known to play a very
important role. We find that the topologies of the quantum orbits are much more
complicated than that of the scarring and associated periodic orbits, since the
former have quantum interference built in. Thus scar wave functions are
necessary to analyze the corresponding dynamics. Moreover, these topologies
imply different return routes to the vicinity of the initial positions, and
this reflects in the existence of different contributions in each peak of the
survival probability function.

atomic system with three, independent channels, we demonstrate a quantum

the phase of an electromagnetic field can be determined by measuring the
population of either of the two states of a two-level atomic system excited by
this field, via the so-called Bloch-Siegert oscillation resulting from the
interference between the co- and counter-rotating excitations. Here, we show
how a degenerate entanglement, created without transmitting any timing signal,
can be used to teleport this phase information. This phase-teleportation
process may be applied to achieve wavelength teleportation, which in turn may
be used for frequency-locking of remote oscillators.

  Vol.9, 2003, IFNA-ANS journal",,,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum Field Theory (QFT) makes predictions by combining two sets of
assumptions: (1) quantum dynamics, such as a Schrodinger or Liouville equation;
(2) quantum measurement, such as stochastic collapse to an eigenfunction of a
measurement operator. A previous paper defined a classical density matrix R
encoding the statistical moments of an ensemble of states of classical
second-order Hamiltonian field theory. It proved Tr(RQ)=E(Q), etc., for the
usual field operators as defined by Weinberg, and it proved that those
observables of the classical system obey the usual Heisenberg dynamic equation.
However, R itself obeys dynamics different from the usual Liouville equation!
This paper derives those dynamics and the discrepancy between CFT and normal
form QFT in predicting any observables g(Q,P). There is some preliminary
evidence for the conjecture that the discrepancies disappear in equilibrium
states (bound states and scattering states) for finite bosonic field theories.
Even if not, they appear small enough to warrant reconsideration of CFT as a
theory of dynamics. Appendix proposes alternative closure of turbulence based
on modified Bogliubov transforms, an application where ordinary ones become
undefined.

Employing a self-similar model, we demonstrate that ideal MHD can account for

Poynting-to-matter energy flux ratio. The solutions also show a transition from
a current-carrying to a return-current regime, partly satisfying the

that this is a likely case for an equatorial wind. Examining the MHD
asymptotics in general, we extend the analysis of Heyvaerts & Norman and
Chiueh, Li, & Begelman by including two new elements: classes of quasi-conical

faster than logarithmic acceleration, and the transition $\sigma=\sigma_c$

Also, line ratios of the rif-triplet of for a few He-like ions XVII are
consistent with the dominance of collisional atomic processes. Yet, the
presence of Fe and Si fluorescence K features indicates that photoionization
also occurs in nearby cold gas. The line profiles indicate a mean velocity at
rest and a broadening of 500 km/s. A global fitting analysis of the line and
continuum spectrum finds that there are 3-4 plasma emission components. The
dominant hot (12 keV) component and has a Fe abundance of 0.22 solar. Some
fraction of this component (10-30%) is heavily absorbed. The other 2-3
components, with temperatures 0.1, 0.4, 3 keV, are ""warm,"" have a nearly solar
composition, a lower column absorption, and are responsible for most other
emission lines. The strength of the fluorescence features and the dual-column
absorption model for the hot plasma component suggest the presence near the hot
sites of a cold gas structure with a column density of 10^23 cm^-2. Since this
value is consistent with theoretical estimates of the vertical disk column of
this star, these attributes suggest that the X-rays originate near the star or
disk. It is possible that the Fe anomaly in the hot component is related to the
First Ionization Potential effect found in coronal structures around active
cool stars. This would be yet another indication that the X-rays -rays are
produced in the immediate vicinity of the Be star.

41 stars with apparent mags 20<I<22. Of these, 23 stars are found to have
radial velocities v<-200km/s indicating they are giants in M31; the rest are
probably foreground Galactic stars. About 2/3 of the M31 members concentrate at
v=-451km/s, with a velocity spread of sigma=27km/s, which suggests that they
belong to the outer disk or perhaps a cold debris trail in the halo. The
group's mean velocity is consistent with that of nearby HI gas and models of
M31's disk velocity field but not with G1 or M31's systemic velocity. We use
V,I photometry to estimate a mean metallicity of <[Fe/H]>=-0.8 for these

consistent with those of G1 (after accounting forits intrinsic spread in both):
one of these stars lies within G1's projected tidal radius and is a likely

its tidal debris. More data are needed to confirm the nature of these 5 stars
as it is likely that they represent M31's smooth halo population. We might have
expected to detect tidal debris if G1 were the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy
being accreted by M31; instead, the majority of M31 giants in this field are
metal-rich and belong to what is evidently the outer disk of M31, and only a

We find that ~75% of Seyferts (both type 1 and 2) and LINERs have radio nuclei

significantly lower (32%); the detections among these are preferentially HII +
LINER/Seyfert composite nuclei. Among ULIRGs with multiple optical or near-IR
nuclei our observations detected only one (or no) nucleus; in these the radio
detection is typically towards the brightest near-IR nucleus. The compactness
of the radio sources, the higher detection rates in AGN-type nuclei than HII
nuclei, the preferential detection of nuclei with unresolved point sources in
the near-IR, the low soft X-ray to nuclear radio luminosity ratio (arguing
against thermal emission powering the radio nuclei), and the lack of
correlation between radio power and Halpha luminosity, all support an origin of
the detected radio nuclei in AGN related activity. This result is especially
interesting for LINER ULIRGs for which signatures of AGNs have often been
ambiguous in other wavebands. Such a high incidence of AGN would provide, for
the first time, a large sample in which to study the interplay between AGN,

related to statistical study of background galaxy ellipticities. We consider a
possibility to extend lensing studies with intrinsically unresolved sources and
suggest that spatial fluctuations in the integrated diffuse emission from these
sources can be used for a lensing reconstruction. Examples of upcoming
possibilities include the diffuse background generated by dusty starburst
galaxies at far-infrared wavelengths, first stars and galaxies in near-infrared
wavelengths, and the background related to 21 cm emission by neutral gas in the
general intergalactic medium prior to reionization. While methods developed to
extract lensing information from cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature
and polarization data can be easily modified to study lensing properties using
diffuse backgrounds at other wavelengths, we suggest that the lensing
extraction from these backgrounds using higher order non-Gaussian clustering
information alone may not be the best approach. In contrast to CMB
anisotropies, reasons for this include the lack of features in the clustering
power spectrum such that the resulting lensing modification to the angular
power spectrum of low-redshift diffuse backgrounds, at arcminute angular
scales, is insignificant. While the use of low redshift backgrounds for lensing
studies will be challenging, due to confusing foregrounds among other reasons,
the use of suggested backgrounds will extend the reconstruction of the
integrated matter power spectrum out to redshifts of 15 to 30, and will bridge
the gap between current and upcoming galaxy lensing studies out to, at most, a
redshift of a few and planned weak lensing studies with CMB out to the last
scattering surface at a redshift of 1100.

the sky. The X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like gas subcluster just
exiting the collision site. A prominent bow shock gives an estimate of the
subcluster velocity, 4500 km/s, which lies mostly in the plane of the sky. The
optical image shows that the gas lags behind the subcluster galaxies. The
weak-lensing mass map reveals a dark matter clump lying ahead of the
collisional gas bullet, but coincident with the effectively collisionless
galaxies. From these observations, one can directly estimate the cross-section
of the dark matter self-interaction. That the dark matter is not fluid-like is
seen directly in the X-ray -- lensing mass overlay; more quantitative limits
can be derived from three simple independent arguments. The most sensitive
constraint, sigma/m<1 cm^2/g, comes from the consistency of the subcluster
mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster (and universal) value, which rules
out a significant mass loss due to dark matter particle collisions. This limit
excludes most of the 0.5-5 cm^2/g interval proposed to explain the flat mass
profiles in galaxies. Our result is only an order-of-magnitude estimate which
involves a number of simplifying, but always conservative, assumptions;
stronger constraints may be derived using hydrodynamic simulations of this

length. We also thoroughly discuss how the clustering signal is affected by
finite volume effects, and show that it vanishes at scales larger than about a

show that number counts and redshift distributions obtained with GALICS and

with density in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, observations indicate
that this correlation is weak. Ambipolar diffusion can decrease the
flux-to-mass ratio in weakly ionized media; however, it is generally thought to
be too slow to play a significant role in the ISM except in the densest
molecular clouds. Turbulence is often invoked in astrophysical problems to
increase transport rates above the (very slow) laminar values predicted by
kinetic theory. We describe a series of numerical experiments addressing the
problem of turbulent transport of magnetic fields in weakly ionized gases. We
show, subject to various geometrical and physical restrictions, that turbulence
in a weakly ionized medium rapidly diffuses the magnetic flux to mass ratio
through the buildup of appreciable ion-neutral drifts on small scales. These
results are applicable to the fieldstrength - density correlation in the ISM,
as well as the merging of flux systems such as protostar and accretion disk
fields or protostellar jets with ambient matter, and the vertical transport of
galactic magnetic fields.

Our algorithm is based on the unsplit formulation of Colella (J. Comput. Phys.

same location. To properly represent the divergence-free condition of the
magnetic fields, we apply a discrete projection to the intermediate values of
the field at cell faces, and apply a filter to the primary dependent variables
at the end of each time step. We test the method against a suite of linear and
nonlinear tests to ascertain accuracy and stability of the scheme under a
variety of conditions. The test suite includes rotated planar linear waves, MHD
shock tube problems, low-beta flux tubes, and a magnetized rotor problem. For
all of these cases, we observe that the algorithm is second-order accurate for
smooth solutions, converges to the correct weak solution for problems involving
shocks, and exhibits no evidence of instability or loss of accuracy due to the
possible presence of non-solenoidal fields.

layers: optical photometric star spot (rotation) cycle, chromospheric Halpha
emission, and coronal X-rays. Two X-ray pointings were carried out with the
Chandra satellite simultaneously with the optical observations, and centered
near the maximum and minimum levels of the optical lightcurve. A relation of
their different count levels to the rotation period of the dominating spot is
not confirmed by a third Chandra observation carried out some months later,
during another minimum of the 1.87d cycle. Similarly we find no indications for
a correlation of the Halpha emission with the spots' rotational phase. The
extraordinary stability of the largest spot is confirmed by long-term
photometric and radial velocity measurements. Joining our optical photometry
with previous data we provide a new estimate for the dominant periodicity of
V410Tau. This updated value removes systematic offsets of the time of minimum
observed in data taken over the last decade. Furthermore, the combination of
the new data with published measurements taken during the last decade allows us
to examine long-term changes in the mean light level of the photometry of
V410Tau. A variation on the timescale of 5.4yr is suggested. Assuming that this

several smaller flares mutually overlap each other. However, we defined a
quasi-steady state outside of obvious flares or flare decays. The spectra from
the flare state and the quasi-steady state are analysed separately. From these
spectra the temperature structure was derived with a multi-temperature model
and with a differential emission measure model. The multi-temperature model was
also used to determine the relative abundances of C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, and
Fe. He-like ions, such as O VII and Ne IX, produce line triplets which are used
to determine or constrain the electron temperature and electron density of the

some complications arise compared to the perfect fluid case, leading us to
consider a generalisation of the standard form of the Sturm-Liouville equation,
the main results of Sturm-Liouville theory remain unaltered. As an important
consequence we conclude that the mass-radius curve for a one-parameter sequence
of regular equilibrium models belonging to some particular equation of state
can be used in the same well-known way as in the perfect fluid case, at least
if the energy density and the tangential pressure of the background solutions

detailed knowledge of this motion is important conceptually and practically,
because the mirrors of laser interferometric detectors of gravitational waves
are essentially free test masses. There exists an analogy between the motion of
free masses in the field of a gravitational wave and the motion of free charges
in the field of an electromagnetic wave. In particular, a gravitational wave
drives the masses in the plane of the wave-front and also, to a smaller extent,
back and forth in the direction of the wave's propagation. To describe this
motion, we introduce the notion of `electric' and `magnetic' components of the
gravitational force. This analogy is not perfect, but it reflects some
important features of the phenomenon. Using different methods, we demonstrate
the presence and importance of what we call the `magnetic' component of motion
of free masses. It contributes to the variation of distance between a pair of
particles. We explicitely derive the full response function of a 2-arm laser
interferometer to a gravitational wave of arbitrary polarization. We give a
convenient description of the response function in terms of the spin-weighted
spherical harmonics. We show that the previously ignored `magnetic' component
may provide a correction of up to 10 %, or so, to the usual `electric'
component of the response function. The `magnetic' contribution must be taken
into account in the data analysis, if the parameters of the radiating system
are not to be mis-estimated.

relatively new subjects of transversity distributions and generalized parton
distributions. These distributions can be studied by measuring single spin
asymmetries, while partonic intrinsic motion and models of new spin dependent
distribution and fragmentation functions are needed to obtain the corresponding
theoretical description. These subjects are not only studied in deep-inelastic
lepton scattering, but also in polarized proton-proton collisions at RHIC. A
selection of results that have been obtained in these experiments together with
several associated theoretical ideas are presented in this paper. In
conclusion, a brief sketch is given of the prospects for experimental and

several years. This work introduces in detail the toroidal and
Z_N-orientifolds, where the main discussion employs the picture of intersecting
D6-branes. The derivation of the R-R and NS-NS tadpole cancellation conditions
in CFT is shown in detail. Various aspects of the massless spectrum are
discussed, involving spacetime anomalies, the generalized Green-Schwarz
mechanism and possible gauge breaking mechanisms. Both N=1 SUSY and non-SUSY
approaches to low energy model building are treated. Firstly, the problem of
complex structure instabilities in toroidal OmegaR-orientifolds is approached
by a Z_3-orbifolded model, including a stable non-SUSY 3-generation
standard-like model. It descends naturally from a flipped SU(5) GUT. Secondly,
supersymmetric models on the Z_4-orbifold are discussed, involving exceptional
3-cycles and the explicit construction of fractional D-branes. A three
generation Pati-Salam model that even can be broken down to a MSSM-like model
is constructed as an example, involving non-flat and non-factorizable branes.
Finally, the possibility that unstable closed and open string moduli could play
the role of the inflaton is being explored. In the closed string sector, the
slow-rolling requirement can only be fulfilled for very specific cases, where
some moduli are frozen and a special choice of coordinates is taken. In the
open string sector, inflation is not possible at all.

discriminate between various internal states. We show that we can achieve the
optimal single-shot discrimination probability using only the effects of
particle statistics. We discuss interesting applications of our method to
detecting entanglement and purifying mixed states. Our scheme can easily be
implemented with the current technology.

  (thanks to excellent referee), to appear in PRA","Phys. Rev. A 69 (2004) 052113","10.1103/PhysRevA.69.052113",,"quant-ph",,"  The principle of complementarity is quantified in two ways: by a universal
uncertainty relation valid for arbitrary joint estimates of any two observables
from a given measurement setup, and by a general uncertainty relation valid for
the_optimal_ estimates of the same two observables when the state of the system
prior to measurement is known. A formula is given for the optimal estimate of
any given observable, based on arbitrary measurement data and prior information
about the state of the system, which generalises and provides a more robust
interpretation of previous formulas for ``local expectations'' and ``weak
values'' of quantum observables. As an example, the canonical joint measurement
of position X and momentum P corresponds to measuring the commuting operators
X_J=X+X', P_J=P-P', where the primed variables refer to an auxilary system in a
minimum-uncertainty state. It is well known that Delta X_J Delta P_J >= hbar.
Here it is shown that given the_same_ physical experimental setup, and
knowledge of the system density operator prior to measurement, one can make
improved joint estimates X_est and P_est of X and P. These improved estimates
are not only statistically closer to X and P: they satisfy Delta X_est Delta
P_est >= hbar/4, where equality can be achieved in certain cases. Thus one can
do up to four times better than the standard lower bound (where the latter
corresponds to the limit of_no_ prior information). Other applications include
the heterodyne detection of orthogonal quadratures of a single-mode optical
field, and joint measurements based on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations.

faithfully reproduces the classically predicted trajectory provided that the
measurement is sufficiently strong to localize the state in phase space but
weak enough that quantum backaction noise is negligible. We investigate the
conditions under which classical dynamics emerges, via continuous position
measurement, for a particle moving in a harmonic well with its position coupled
to internal spin. As a consequence of this coupling we find that classical
dynamics emerges only when the position and spin actions are both large
compared to $\hbar$. These conditions are quantified by placing bounds on the
size of the covariance matrix which describes the delocalized quantum coherence
over extended regions of phase space. From this result it follows that a mixed
quantum-classical regime (where one subsystem can be treated classically and
the other not) does not exist for a continuously observed spin 1/2 particle.
When the conditions for classicallity are satisfied (in the large-spin limit),
the quantum trajectories reproduce both the classical periodic orbits as well
as the classically chaotic phase space regions. As a quantitative test of this
convergence we compute the largest Lyapunov exponent directly from the measured
quantum trajectories and show that it agrees with the classical value.

molecular potential which asymptotically varies as $-1/R^3$. The properties of
these states are of considerable interest as they can be formed by
photoassociation (PA) of two ground state atoms. The Franck-Condon overlap
integrals between the harmonically trapped atom-pair states and the
ultralong-range molecular vibrational states are estimated and compared with
their values for a pair of untrapped free atoms in the low-energy scattering
state. We find that the binding between a pair of ground-state atoms by a
harmonic trap has significant effect on the Franck-Condon integrals and thus
can be used to influence PA. Trap-induced binding between two ground-state
atoms may facilitate coherent PA dynamics between the two atoms and the
photoassociated diatomic molecule.

divides a one dimensional box into two halves. The two half boxes contain the
same (fixed) number of noninteracting bosons, are kept at the same temperature,
and admit the same boundary conditions at the outer walls; the only difference
is the distinct boundary conditions imposed at the two sides of the partition
wall. The net force acting on the partition wall is nonzero at zero temperature
and remains almost constant for low temperatures. As the temperature increases,
the force starts to decrease considerably, but after reaching a minimum it
starts to increase, and tends to infinity with a square-root-of-temperature
asympotics. This example demonstrates clearly that distinct boundary conditions
cause remarkable physical effects for quantum systems.

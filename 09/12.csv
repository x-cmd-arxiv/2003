that shows a decrease in flux of 3.5 magnitudes lasting for 18 days and
repeating every 48 days. The eclipsing material is likely due to orbiting dust
or rocky bodies in a partial ring or warped disk that periodically occults the
star. We measured the polarized spectrum in and out of eclipse at the Keck and
Palomar observatories. Outside of the eclipse, the star exhibited low
polarization consistent with zero. During eclipse, the polarization increased
dramatically to ~2% across the optical spectrum, while the spectrum had the
same continuum shape as outside of eclipse and exhibited emission lines of much
larger equivalent width, as previously seen. From the data, we conclude that
(a) the scattering region is uneclipsed; (b) the scattering is nearly
achromatic; (c) the star is likely completely eclipsed so that the flux during
eclipse is entirely due to scattered light, a conclusion also argued for by the
shape of the ingress and egress. We argue that the scattering is not due to
electrons, but may be due to large dust grains of size ~10 micron, similar to
the interplanetary grains which scatter the zodiacal light. We construct a
warped-disk model with an extended dusty atmosphere which reproduces the main
features of the lightcurve, namely (a) a gradual decrease before ingress due to
extinction in the atmosphere (similar for egress); (b) a sharper decrease
within ingress due to the optically-thick base of the atmosphere; (c) a
polarized flux during eclipse which is 0.1% of the total flux outside of
eclipse, which requires no fine-tuning of the model. (abridged)

could either be a quasi-static diffuse cloud fed by the jet, or an outer
extension of the jet with a high bulk Lorentz factor. We argue that the lack of
an obvious detection of radio emission from the extended component could be a
consequence of Compton losses on the electron population, or of a low magnetic
field. Extended X-ray emission produced by inverse Compton scattering may be
common around high redshift radio galaxies and quasars, demonstrating that
significant power is injected into their surrounding by powerful jets.

Fourier modes are spawned from parent ones, with their phases following a

such harmonic relation. We also use simple toy models to demonstrate that

strongly inhomogenous, primordial baryon distribution on sub-galactic scales
for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies and
Galaxy Formation (including fully non-linear evolution to z=0) are discussed,
and the inflationary theory leading to such distributions is briefly reviewed.
It is found that Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is essentially unaffected relative to
SBBN and that the change in recombination history at z~1500-700 relative to
``standard'' theory leads to differences in the anisotropy and polarization
power spectra, which should be detectable by the Planck satellite provided
systematic effects can be accounted for. Moreover, it is shown by fully
cosmological, hydro/gravity simulations that the formation of galactic discs is
only weakly affected by going from smooth to highly non-homogenous, initial
baryon distributions. In particular, the final disc angular momenta at z=0 are
as large as for the standard case and the ``disc angular momentum problem'' is
solved to within a factor of two or better without invoking (hypothetical)
energetic feedback events. A very desirable difference relative to the the
standard WDM model, however, is that the on-set of star (and AGN) formation
happens earlier. For the ``optimal'' free-streaming mass scale of M_f~1.5x10^11
h^-1 Msun the redshift of formation of the first stars increases from z_*=4-5
to >6.5, in much better agreement with observational data on high-redshift
galaxies and QSOs. It will, however, not be possible to push z_* above ~10,
because at higher redshifts the gas velocity field is nowhere compressive.
Probing the ``dark ages'' will hence enable a direct test of this theory.

Accepted to ApJ","Astrophys.J.600:17-25,2004","10.1086/379768",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a method to implement the idea of Jain & Taylor to constrain
cosmological parameters with weak gravitational lensing. Photometric redshift
information on foreground galaxies is used to produce templates of the mass
structure at foreground slices z_\ell, and the predicted distortion field is
cross-correlated with the measured shapes of sources at redshift z_s. The
variation of the cross-correlation with z_s depends purely on ratios of angular
diameter distances. We propose a formalism for such an analysis that makes use
of all foreground-background redshift pairs, and derive the Fisher
uncertainties on the dark energy parameters that would result from such a
survey. Surveys from the proposed SNAP satellite or the LSST observatory could
constrain the dark energy equation of state to 0.01 f_sky^{-1/2} in w_0 and
0.035 f_sky^{-1/2} in w_a after application of a practical prior on \Omega_m.
Advantages of this method over power-spectrum measurements are that it is
unaffected by residual PSF distortions, is not limited by sample-variance, and
can use non-linear mass structures to constrain cosmology. The signal is,
however, very small, amounting to a change of a few parts in 10^3 of the
lensing distortion. The calibration of lensing distortion must be independent
of redshift to comparable levels, and photometric redshifts must be similarly
free of bias. Both of these tasks require substantial advance over the present
state of the art, but we discuss how such accurate calibrations might be
achieved using internal consistency tests. Elimination of redshift bias would
require spectroscopic redshifts of 10^4-10^5 high redshift galaxies.

the handles provided by other observations. In this paper we show that cross
correlating the CMB with an overlapping weak lensing survey will isolate the
elusive kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect from secondary anisotropies generated
at higher redshifts. We show that if upcoming high angular resolution CMB
experiments, like PLANCK/ACT/SPT, cover the same area of sky as current and
future weak lensing surveys, like CFTHLS/SNAP/LSST, the cross correlation of
cosmic shear with the kSZ effect will be detected with high signal to noise

example, if ACT and a CFHTLS like survey were to overlap this cross-correlation
would be detected with a total signal to noise ratio greater than 220, reaching
1.8 per individual multipole around l \sim 5000. Furthermore, this
cross-correlation probes the three point coupling between the underlying dark
matter and the ""momentum"" of the ionized baryons in the densest regions of the
universe at intermediate redshifts. Similar to the tSZ power spectrum, its
strength is extremely sensitive to the power spectrum normalization parameter,

isolate any component of anisotropy due to patchy reionization and rule out

between 3500-7000 Ang, the K-band and the FIR flux. We require a minimum of 3
populations -- (1) a young population of age < 8 Myr, with its corresponding
nebular emission, (2) an intermediate-age population (age < 500 Myr), and (3)
an old population that forms part of the underlying disk or/and bulge
population. The contribution of the old population to the K-band luminosity
depends on the birthrate parameter and remains above 60% in the majority of the
sample galaxies. Even in the blue band, the intermediate age and old
populations contribute more than 40% of the total flux in all the cases. A
relatively high contribution from the old stars to the K-band nuclear flux is
also apparent from the strength of the 4000 Ang break and the CaII K line. The
extinction of the old population is found to be around half of that of the
young population. The contribution to the continuum from the relatively old
stars has the effect of diluting the emission equivalent widths below the
values expected for young bursts. The mean dilution factors are found to be 5
and 3 for the Halpha and Hbeta lines respectively.

that the outburst was caused by the expansion of a red giant, followed by the

reproduce both the PMS lithium depletion (inferred from the lithium depletion
patterns in young open clusters), and the location of PMS tracks in the HR
diagram (inferred from the study of young PMS stars), convection both in the
atmosphere and in a good fraction of the stellar envelope must be highly
inefficient: e.g., in the Mixing Length Theory approximation, it must have a
very low alpha=l/H_p. Unfortunately, the radii of these models are at variance
with the solar radius, possibly indicating t hat there is some additional
physical input, generally not taken into account in the stellar models, which
affects the efficiency of convection in PMS stars, but probably not in the main

the use of auxiliary data. A highly significant correlation between luminosity
and linear diameter was found and the corresponding least-square linear

centre. We also confirm, for a much larger sample, the previously reported
positive gradient of electron temperature with galactocentric distance.

values, and restrictions in parameter space allowed during analysis. Starting
from a complete set of UBVRIJH passbands (respectively their Hubble Space
Telescope/WFPC2 equivalents) we investigate to which extent clusters with
different combinations of age, metallicity, internal extinction and mass can or
cannot be disentangled in the various evolutionary stages throughout their
lifetimes and what are the most useful passbands required to resolve the

observations consisting of near-infrared integral field spectroscopy and
mid-infrared spectroscopy. The models incorporate stellar evolution, spectral
synthesis, and photoionization modeling, and are optimized for 1-45 micron
observations of starburst galaxies. The data allow us to model the starburst
regions on scales as small as 25 pc. We investigate the initial mass function
(IMF) of the stars and constrain quantitatively the spatial and temporal
evolution of starburst activity in M82. We find a typical decay timescale for
individual burst sites of a few million years. The data are consistent with the
formation of very massive stars (> 50-100 Msun) and require a flattening of the
starburst IMF below a few solar masses assuming a Salpeter slope at higher
masses. Our results are well matched by a scenario in which the global
starburst activity in M82 occurred in two successive episodes each lasting a
few million years, peaking about 10 and 5 Myr ago. The first episode took place
throughout the central regions of M82 and was particularly intense at the
nucleus while the second episode occurred predominantly in a circumnuclear ring
and along the stellar bar. We interpret this sequence as resulting from the
gravitational interaction M82 and its neighbour M81, and subsequent bar-driven
evolution. The short burst duration on all spatial scales indicates strong
negative feedback effects of starburst activity, both locally and globally.
Simple energetics considerations suggest the collective mechanical energy
released by massive stars was able to rapidly inhibit star formation after the
onset of each episode.

stars in NGC 5128. Mostly they are found to be brighter than the tip of the
first ascent giant branch with magnitudes ranging from about K=19 to K=21.5.
They have periods between 155 and 1000 days and K-band amplitudes between 0.1
and 2 mag, characteristic of semi-regular and Mira variables. We compare the
colors, periods and amplitudes of these variables with those found in old
stellar populations like Galactic globular clusters and Galactic bulge as well
as with intermediate-age Magellanic Cloud long period variables. The population
of stars above the tip of the red giant branch (RGB) amounts to 2176 stars in
the outer halo field (Field 1) and 6072 stars in the inner halo field (Field
2). The comparison of the luminosity functions of the Galactic bulge, M31 bulge
and NGC 5128 halo fields shows an excess of bright AGB stars extending to M_K ~
-8.65. The large majority of these sources belong to the asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) population in NGC 5128. Subtracting the foreground Galactic stars
and probable blends, at least 26% and 70% of AGB stars are variable in Fields 1
and 2, respectively. The average period of NGC 5128 LPVs is 395 days and the
average amplitude 0.77 mag. Many more short period Miras are present in Field 2
than in Field 1 indicating a difference in the stellar populations between the
two fields. Period and amplitude distributions and near-IR colors of the
majority of LPVs in NGC 5128 are similar to the Galactic bulge variables.
However, some ~10% of LPVs have periods longer than 500 days and thus probably
more massive, hence younger, progenitor stars. A few carbon star candidates are
identified based on their red J-H and H-K colors.

large-scale, time-dependent accretion flows within the radially oscillating and
outflowing circumstellar gas around Miras are related to Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton
flows, but have not, to our knowledge, been previously modelled. The new models
presented in this paper illustrate the changes in accretion and wake dynamics
as the companion mass is varied over a range from 10 to 50 Jupiter masses
($M_J$). The character of the accretion onto the companion changes greatly as
the companion mass is increased. At the lowest companion masses considered
here, a low continuous rate of mass accretion is punctuated by large, nearly
periodic bursts of accretion. When the companion mass is large, the mass
accretion has both a continuous part, and a rapidly varying, nearly stochastic
part. These trends can be understood as the result of the interplay between the
shocks and radial oscillations in the circumstellar gas, and the wake flow
behind the companion. Models with accretion bursts may produce observable
optical brightenings, and may affect SiO maser emission. (Abridged)

mass of 216 GeV emerges from such terms, as well as a scalar-field-interaction

untested, allowing the NMSSM PQ axion to provide a solution to the strong CP
problem and be a good dark matter candidate. Unfortunately the new particle
states are so decoupled that they would not be observable at future colliders,
and the NMSSM would appear indistinguishable from the minimal model. However,
we show that in order to maintain vacuum stability, such a model requires that
the heavy Higgs boson states have masses that lie close to approximately mu tan

allow one to either rule out the NMSSM PQ axion, or provide tantalizing

the baryonic asymmetry of the vacuum induces the baryonic asymmetry of matter

scattering length is determined by five interaction potentials instead of one,
even in the spin-polarized case, a unique property among the Bose condensed
species and candidates. Because the interaction potentials of Ne* are not known
accurately enough to predict the value of the scattering length, we investigate
the behavior of $a$ as a function of the five phase integrals corresponding to
the five interaction potentials. We find that the scattering length has five
resonances instead of only one and cannot be described by a simple gas-kinetic
approach or the DIS approximation. However, the probability for finding a
positive or large value of the scattering length is not enhanced compared to
the single potential case. The complex behavior of $a$ is studied by comparing
a quantum mechanical five-channel numerical calculation to simpler two-channel
models. We find that the induced dipole-dipole interaction is responsible for
coupling between the different |\Omega> states, resulting in an inhomogeneous
shift of the resonance positions and widths in the quantum mechanical
calculation as compared to the DIS approach. The dependence of the resonance
positions and widths on the input potentials turns out to be rather
straightforward. The existence of two bosonic isotopes of Ne* enables us to
choose the isotope with the most favorable scattering length for efficient
evaporative cooling towards the Bose-Einstein Condensation transition, greatly
enhancing the feasibility to reach this transition.

  figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Using standard methods from string theory, this paper presents a
comprehensive survey about the most important aspects of the theory of sand.
Special interest is put on the examination of the sand-wind duality and the
interaction of ordinary (non-supersymmetric) sand with the heat field of the
earth, as solution of the field inequalities of a stone. This will lead us, in
a natural way, to completely new insights into the theory of sandstorms.

state of a spin ensemble and a scalar magnetic field with information obtained
from a continuous quantum limited measurement of the spin precession due to the
field. The full quantum parameter estimation model is reduced to a simplified
equivalent representation to which classical estimation and control theory is
applied. We consider both the tracking of static and fluctuating fields in the
transient and steady state regimes. By using feedback control, the field
estimation can be made robust to uncertainty about the total spin number.

common to both classical and quantum algebras. It is convenient to define
distinct notions of time-ordered exponentials to take account of the breakdown
of the Leibniz rule in the Ito calculus. We introduce a notion of quantum
Stratonovich calculus and show how it relates to Stratonovich-Dyson time
ordered exponentials. We then use it to demonstrate a natural way to add
stochastic derivations.

  (2004)","10.1063/1.1723701",,"quant-ph",,"  The two-qubit canonical decomposition SU(4) = [SU(2) \otimes SU(2)] Delta
[SU(2) \otimes SU(2)] writes any two-qubit quantum computation as a composition
of a local unitary, a relative phasing of Bell states, and a second local
unitary. Using Lie theory, we generalize this to an n-qubit decomposition, the
concurrence canonical decomposition (C.C.D.) SU(2^n)=KAK. The group K fixes a
bilinear form related to the concurrence, and in particular any computation in
K preserves the tangle |<phi^*|(-i sigma^y_1)...(-i sigma^y_n)|phi>|^2 for n
even. Thus, the C.C.D. shows that any n-qubit quantum computation is a
composition of a computation preserving this n-tangle, a computation in A which
applies relative phases to a set of GHZ states, and a second computation which
preserves it.
  As an application, we study the extent to which a large, random unitary may
change concurrence. The result states that for a randomly chosen a in A within
SU(2^{2p}), the probability that a carries a state of tangle 0 to a state of
maximum tangle approaches 1 as the even number of qubits approaches infinity.
Any v=k_1 a k_2 for such an a \in A has the same property. Finally, although
|<phi^*|(-i sigma^y_1)...(-i sigma^y_n)|phi>|^2 vanishes identically when the
number of qubits is odd, we show that a more complicated C.C.D. still exists in
which K is a symplectic group.

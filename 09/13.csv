spectra of (especially earlier-type) rapidly rotating stars are systematically
blueshifted by 3 km/s or more, relative to the spectra of slowly rotating ones.
Comparisons with astrometrically determined radial motions in the Hyades
suggests this to be an absolute blueshift, relative to wavelengths naively
expected from stellar radial motion and gravitational redshift. Analogous
trends are seen also in most other clusters studied (Pleiades, Coma Berenices,
Praesepe, Alpha Persei, IC 2391, NGC 6475, IC 4665, NGC 1976 and NGC 2516).
Possible mechanisms are discussed, including photospheric convection, stellar
pulsation, meridional circulation, and shock-wave propagation, as well as
effects caused by template mismatch in determining wavelength displacements.
For early-type stars, a plausible mechanism is shock-wave propagation upward
through the photospheric line-forming regions. Such wavelength shifts thus
permit studies of certain types of stellar atmospheric dynamics and -
irrespective of their cause - may influence deduced open-cluster membership
(when selected from common velocity) and deduced cluster dynamics (some types
of stars might show fortuitous velocity patterns).

Simple arguments suggest that interferometric detection and characterization

working angle, or angular resolution limit. We show that the peak signal from a
nulling infrared interferometer of baseline ($\lesssim 40$ meters) will often
occur `inside the null', and that the signal variations from path-difference
fluctuations will cancel to first order in the ratio of two wavelengths. Using
a new interferometer simulation code, we evaluate the detectability of all the
known extrasolar planets as observed using this two-color method with the
proposed {\it Fourier Kelvin Stellar Interferometer (FKSI)}. In its minimum
configuration {\it FKSI} uses two 0.5-meter apertures on a 12.5-meter baseline,
and a $\pm 20^{\circ}$ field-of-regard. We predict that $\sim 7$ known
extrasolar planets are directly detectable using {\it FKSI}, with
low-resolution spectroscopy ($R \sim 20$) being possible in the most favorable

3$), the ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) should be the dominant source of
dispersion without substantial local or foreground contamination, offering a
unique probe of the cosmic reionization epoch through measures of the free
electron column density out to different redshifts. The delay times from $z
\sim 10$ can be $\sim$ 1 hour at 100 MHz and $\sim$ 10 hours at 30 MHz. On the
other hand, dispersion by local ionized material may be important for GRBs at
lower redshifts if they occur inside or behind dense molecular clouds,
providing clues to the GRB environment; free-free absorption may also be
significant in this case. Detecting dispersion delay in the known radio
afterglow emission should be extremely challenging due to the low fluxes at the
relevant frequencies, but may be marginally possible for rare, bright
afterglows by the {\it Square Kilometer Array}. If GRBs also emit prompt,
coherent radio emission as predicted by Sagiv & Waxman (2002), the
observational prospects can be much better; detection of a sufficient sample of
high $z$ GRBs by the {\it Low Frequency Array} may allow a discrimination of
different reionization histories. Interesting constraints on the low redshift,
warm-hot IGM may also be obtainable through dispersion.

beta(r) < 0.35 within the effective radius. However, the X-ray gas temperature

collisions between the quasi-particles are mediated by phonon-like excitations

Hamiltonian of a Boson gas and uses, in an appropriate way, the generalized
random phase approximation. As a result, the collision term of the kinetic
equation contains higher order contributions in the expansion in the

involves the emission and the absorption of a phonon-like excitation. The major
interest of this particular mechanism is that, in a regime where the condensate
is stable, the collision process between condensed and non condensed particles
is totally blocked due to a total annihilation of the mutual interaction
potential induced by the condensate itself. As a consequence, the condensate is
not constrained to relax and can be superfluid. Furthermore, a Boltzmann-like
H-theorem for the entropy exists for this equation and allows to distinguish
between dissipative and non dissipative phenomena (like vortices). We also
illustrate the analogy between this approach and the kinetic theory for a
plasma, in which the excitations correspond precisely to a plasmon. Finally, we
show the equivalence of this theory with the non-number conserving Bogoliubov

anisotropic. Competition between this anisotropic surface tension and

transitions when the external field is applied along the c-axis (for R=Tb) or
perpendicular to it (R = Ho, Er, Tm), or even in both orientations as in the

TmAgGe, where magnetic moments lie in the $ab$-plane, provides the possibility
of studying the angular dependence of metamagnetism in hexagonal compounds with
the rare earth in orthorhombic point symmetry.
  YbAgGe has distinct properties from the rest of the series: an enhanced
electronic specific heat coefficient ($\gamma

ordering below 1.0 K. This compound appears to be close to a quantum critical

  10",,"10.1143/JPSJ.72.2433",,"cond-mat",,"  The metal-insulator transition in VO2 was investigated using the three-band
Hubbard model, in which the degeneracy of the 3d orbitals, the on-site Coulomb
and exchange interactions, and the effects of lattice distortion were
considered. A new scenario on the phase transition is proposed, where the
increase in energy level separation among the t_2g orbitals caused by the
lattice distortion triggers an abrupt change in the electronic configuration in
doubly occupied sites from an S=1 Hund's coupling state to a spin S=0 state
with much larger energy, and this strongly suppresses the charge fluctuation.
Although the material is expected to be a Mott-Hubbard insulator in the
insulating phase, the metal-to-insulator transition is not caused by an
increase in relative strength of the Coulomb interaction against the electron
hopping as in the usual Mott transition, but by the level splitting among the
t_2g orbitals against the on-site exchange interaction. The metal-insulator
transition in Ti2O3 can also be explained by the same scenario. Such a large
change in the 3d orbital occupation at the phase transition can be detected by
linear dichroic V 2p x-ray absorption measurements.

timelike embeddings. We point out how the braneworld geodesic postulates lead

accurately capture the characteristics of real materials, which cannot
constrain the modes of the fluctuating field at all energies. We study the
vacuum polarization energy of renormalizable, continuum quantum field theory in
the presence of a background field, designed to impose a Dirichlet boundary
condition in a particular limit. We show that in two and three space
dimensions, as a background field becomes concentrated on the surface on which
the Dirichlet boundary condition would eventually hold, the Casimir energy
diverges. This result implies that the energy depends in detail on the
properties of the material, which are not captured by the idealized boundary
conditions. This divergence does not affect the force between rigid bodies, but
it does invalidate calculations of Casimir stresses based on idealized boundary

Lorentz group irredicible representations, including scalar, two 4-vectors, and
antisymmetric 2-rang tensor, is investigated. Initial equations depend upon
four complex parameters $\lambda_{i}$, obeying two supplementary conditions, so
restriction of the model to the case of electrically neutral vector particle is
not a trivial task. A special basis in the space of 15-component wave functions
is found where instead of four $\lambda_{i}$ only one real-valued quantity
$\sigma$, a bilinear combination of $\lambda_{i}$, is presented. This
$\lambda$-parameter is interpreted as an additional electromagnetic
characteristic of a charged vector particle, polarizability. It is shown that
in this basis $C$-operation is reduced to the complex conjugation only, without
any accompanying linear transformation. Restriction to a massless vector
particle is determined.
  Extension of the whole theory to the case of Riemannian space-time is
accomplished. Two methods of obtaining corresponding generally covariant wave
equations are elaborated: of tensor- and of tetrad-based ones. Their
equivalence is proved. It is shown that in case of pure curved space-time
models without Cartan torsion no specific additional interaction terms because
of non-flat geometry arise. The conformal symmetry of a massless generally
covariant equation is demonstrated explicitly. A canonical tensor of
energy-momentum $T_{\beta \alpha}$ is constructed, its conservation law happens
to involves the Riemann curvature tensor. Within the framework of known
ambiguity of any energy-momentum tensor, a new tensor $\bar{T}_{\beta \alpha}$
is suggested to be used, which obeys a common conservation law.

based on the laser pulse compression, carrier frequency upshift and focusing by
a counter-propagating breaking plasma wave, relativistic flying parabolic
mirror. This method allows us to achieve the quantum electrodynamics critical
field (Schwinger limit) with present day laser systems.

investigated with two dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations. The fiber is a
narrow hollow channel with walls consisting of overdense plasma. In the
nonlinear interaction of the laser pulse with fiber walls high order harmonics
are generated. Sufficiently high harmonics, for which the fiber walls are
transparent, propagate outwards at certain angle. This is a scheme of a
generator of ultra-short pulses of coherent light with a very short wavelength.

pi/2 polarization or alternatively a 0 or pi/2 phase measured by
interferometry. We introduce a new set of bases, i.e. pulses sent in either a
frequency or time basis if the pulses are assumed to be transform limited. In
addition it is discussed how this scheme can be easily generalized from a
binary to an N-dimensional system, i.e., to ``quNdits.'' Optimal pulse
distribution and the chances for eavesdropping are discussed.

coupling between spacially separated quantum dots on a microchip. The technique
is based on capacitive interactions between the electron charge and a
superconducting transmission line resonator, and is closely related to atomic
cavity quantum electrodynamics. We investigate several potential applications
of this technique which have varying degrees of complexity. In particular, we
demonstrate that this mechanism allows design and investigation of an on-chip
double-dot microscopic maser. Moreover, the interaction may be extended to
couple spatially separated electron spin states while only virtually populating
fast-decaying superpositions of charge states. This represents an effective,
controllable long-range interaction, which may facilitate implementation of
quantum information processing with electron spin qubits and potentially allow
coupling to other quantum systems such as atomic or superconducting qubits.

properties, would carry a distinctive experimental signature. Such systems can
exist in deterministic hidden-variables theories (such as the pilot-wave theory
of de Broglie and Bohm). The signature consists of non-additive expectations
for non-commuting observables, breaking the sinusoidal modulation of quantum
probabilities for two-state systems. This effect is independent of the quantum
state (pure or mixed), or of the details of the hidden-variables model.
Experiments are proposed, testing polarisation probabilities for single
photons.

theoretical efficiency of this protocol is double compared with BB84 protocol.
We show this protocol is unconditional secure under arbitrary quantum attack.
And we discuss that this protocol can be perfectly implemented with current
technologies.

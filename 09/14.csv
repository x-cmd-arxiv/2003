universes have often concentrated on the range of values of $\Omega_{0}$ given
by current observations. Here we study the consequences of taking the bounds on
$\Omega_{0}$ given by inflationary models, i.e. $|\Omega_0 - 1| \ll 1$. We show
that in this limit, a generic detectable non-flat manifold is locally
indistinguishable from either a cylindrical ($R^2 \times S^1$) or toroidal ($R
\times T^2$) manifold, irrespective of its global shape, with the former being
more likely. Importantly this is compatible with some recent indications based
on the analysis of high resolution CMB data. It also implies that in this limit
an observer would not be able to distinguish topologically whether the universe
is spherical, hyperbolic or flat. By severely restricting the expected
topological signatures of detectable isometries, our results provide an
effective theoretical framework for interpreting cosmological observations, and
can be used to confine any parameter space which realistic search strategies,
such as the `circles in the sky' method, need to concentrate on. This is
particularly important in the inflationary limit, where the precise nature of
cosmic topology becomes undecidable.

values for the threshold ratio of the gas surface density to the critical
surface density in the range 0.5 to 0.7. We also test various star formation
laws proposed in the literature, i.e. either the simple Schmidt law or
modifications of it, that take into account dynamical factors. We find only
small differences among them as far as the overall fit to our data is
concerned; in particular, we find that all three SF laws (with parameters
derived from the fits to our data) match particularly well observations in the

particular, that the guts of (M,S) is empty.

beams produce phase-dependent gain into a weak bisector signal beam in a

advancement caused by cross-phase modulation between the pump and signal beams.
We relate this process to the inverse of spatial modulational instability and
suggest a time-domain analog.

  Second Law of Newton","12 pages,1 figure Abstract is modified, and a few substantial points
  missed in the first version are added",,,,"physics.gen-ph physics.ed-ph",,"  It is shown that for a relativistic particle moving in an electromagnetic
field its equations of motion written in a form of the second law of Newton can
be reduced with the help of elementary operations to the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation. The derivation is based on a possibility of transforming the equation
of motion to a completely antisymmetric form. Moreover, by perturbing the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation we obtain the principle of least action.\
  The analogous procedure is easily extended to a general relativistic motion
of a charged relativistic particle in an electromagnetic field. It sis also
shown that the special-relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a free
particle allows one to easily demonstrate the wave-particle duality inherent to
this equation and, in addition, to obtain the operators of the four-momentum
whose eigenvalues are the classical four-momentum

cryptographically private key. This allows us to recast the theory of privacy
as a paradigm closely related to that used in entanglement manipulation. It is
shown that one can distill an arbitrarily secure key from bound entangled
states. There are also states which have less distillable private key than the
entanglement cost of the state. In general the amount of distillable key is
bounded from above by the relative entropy of entanglement. Relationships
between distillability and distinguishability are found for a class of states
which have Bell states correlated to separable hiding states. We also describe
a technique for finding states exhibiting irreversibility in entanglement
distillation.

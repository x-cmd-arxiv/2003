nonsingular inflationary chaotic-type cosmological models. Initial conditions
for nonsingular solutions at the bounce correspond to dominance of potential
part of the energy density of the scalar field over its kinetic part both
within general relativity and gauge theories of gravity. Moreover, scalar field
at the bounce exceeds the planckian value and on expansion stage these models
correspond to chaotic inflation. Such solutions can be well approximated by
explicitly solvable model with constant effective potential (cosmological term)
and massless scalar field during the bounce and on stages of quasi-exponential
contraction and expansion. Perturbative analysis shows that nonsingular
inflationary solutions are exponentially unstable during contraction stage.
This result is compared with numerical calculations.

regions varies from non-nucleated starburst clumps through dust-covered nuclei
to a nucleated morphology. There is no unambiguous trend in the morphology with
merger stage. The emission-line morphology is extended beyond the nucleus in
most cases, but centrally concentrated (within 1 kpc) emission-line gas can be
seen in the four latest-stage merger systems. We have quantified the intrinsic
luminosity densities and colors within the inner 100 pc and 1 kpc of each
identified nucleus. We find little evidence for a clear trend in nuclear
properties along the merger sequence, other than a suggestive rise in the
nuclear luminosity density in the most evolved members of the sequence. The
lack of clear trends in nuclear properties is likely due both to the effects of
obscuration and geometry, as well as the physical variety of galaxies included
in the Toomre Sequence.

emission measure in this temperature interval is ~12.2*10^51 cm^-3 for the

by the hot component (30 MK). The iron K-shell is more prominent in the flare

well-defined thermodynamic limit for the astrophysical systems with the
following power law form: to tend the number of particles, N, the total energy,
E, and the characteristic linear dimension of the system, L, to infinity,
keeping constant E/N^{\Lambda_{E}} and L/N^{\Lambda_{L}}, being \Lambda_{E} and
\Lambda_{L} certain scaling exponent constant. This study is carried out for a
system constituted by a non-rotating fluid under the influence of its own
Newtonian gravitational interaction. The analysis yields that a thermodynamic
limit of the above form will only appear when the local pressure depends on the
energy density of fluid as $p=\gamma\epsilon$, being $\gamma$ certain constant.
Therefore, a thermodynamic limit with a power law form can be only satisfied by
a reduced set of models, such as the selfgravitating gas of fermions and the
Antonov isothermal model.

explain the luminosity of radio pulsars as a result of their spin-down, it is
of some interest to explore how much of magnetic flux can actually penetrate
the surface of the rotating neutron stars at least in idealized situations. In
order to address this issue, one needs to figure out the amount of charge on

present work, based on the solution-generating method given by Wald, the
magnetic fields around both the uncharged and (slightly) charged neutron star

demonstrated following again the argument by Wald that the neutron star will
gradually accrete the charge until it reaches the equilibrium value
$\tilde{Q}=2B_{0}J$. Then next, the magnetic flux through one half of the
surface of the rotating neutron star has been computed as well. With the
nonvanishing accretion charge having value in the range $0 < \tilde{Q} \leq

greater than that without the accretion charge.

combined stellar winds and supernova ejecta from the young starbursts, with an
extended low density halo. The variety of observed Lyman alpha profiles both in
our sample and in high redshift starbursts is explained as phases in the time
evolution of the super-shell expanding into the disk and halo of the host
galaxy. The observed shapes, widths and velocities are in excellent agreement
with the super-shell scenario predictions and represent a time sequence. We
confirm that among the many intrinsic parameters of a star forming region that
can affect the properties of the observed Lyman alpha profiles, velocity and
density distributions of neutral gas along the line of sight are by far the
dominant ones, while the amount of dust will determine the intensity of the
emission line, if any.

paradigms, the results are scattered. To alleviate this problem, the Automated
and Algorithmic Debugging workshop (AADEBUG for short) was organised in 1993 in
Link""oping (Sweden). As this workshop proved to be successful, subsequent
workshops have been organised in 1995 (Saint-Malo, France), 1997 (again in
Link""oping, Sweden) and 2000 (Munich, Germany). In 2003, the workshop is

possible new interactions. We briefly discuss these aspects and then proceed by
describing some of the observables which characterize the atmospheric shower.

indicate that the lepton number violating nature of the underlying decay

interesting in the context of RPV models of neutrino mass where the RPV
couplings ($\lambda'_{i3j}$) driving the above decay are constrained to be
small ($\lsim 10^{-3} - 10^{-4} $). If $\tilde t_1$ is the next lightest super
particle - a theoretically well motivated scenario - then the RPV decay can
naturally compete with the R-parity conserving (RPC) modes which also have
suppressed widths. The model independent limiting BR can delineate the
parameter space in specific supersymmetric models, where the dominating RPV
decay is observable and predict the minimum magnitude of the RPV coupling that
will be sensitive to Run-II data. We have found it to be in the same ballpark
value required by models of neutrino mass, for a wide range of $\MST$. A
comprehensive future strategy for linking top squark decays with models of

resonator. With the atoms modelled by a collection of anharmonic Lorentz
oscillators, the effective interaction is evaluated to second order in the
coupling constant (the anharmonicity parameter). The interaction has the form
of a renormalized two-dimensional delta-function potential, with the
renormalization scale determined by the physical parameters of the system, such
as density of atoms and the detuning of the photons relative to the resonance
frequency of the atoms. For realistic values of the parameters, the
perturbation series has to be resummed, and the effective interaction becomes
independent of the ``bare'' strength of the anharmonic term. The resulting
expression for the non-linear Kerr susceptibility, is parametrically equal to
the one found earlier for a dilute gas of two-level atoms. Using our result for
the effective interaction parameter, we derive conditions for the formation of
a photon fluid, both for Rydberg atoms in a microwave cavity and for alkali
atoms in an optical cavity.

length at the interaction point (IP). A natural way to decrease the bunch
length is to decrease the momentum compaction factor and/or to increase the RF
voltage. However, in such a way we cannot obtain short bunches with high
currents since wakefields prevent this due to the potential well distortion and
the microwave instability. In present paper we propose to use a strong RF
focusing (with high RF voltage and high momentum compaction factor) to obtain
very short bunches at the IP with progressive bunch elongation towards the RF
cavity. This allows placing the most important impedance generating elements
near the RF cavity where the bunch is longest thus minimizing the effect of the
wakefields.

instantaneously results from cutting magnetic flux as a conductor moving with

interaction of a conductor or charged particles with the arriving
electromagnetic wave, which is originated from a changing magnetic flux source.
Upon the Lenz differential forms, the induced electrical field strength,

general setting, we formulate in mathematical terms a condition on ""local

experiments of the Alice/Bob type are ""locally realistic"". For an arbitrary
bipartite quantum state, we derive quantum analogs of the original Bell
inequality. In view of our results, we argue that the violation of Bell-type
inequalities in the quantum case cannot be a valid argument in the discussion
on locality or non-locality of quantum interactions.

represented through a pair of product states which evolve according to a
Markovian random jump process. This representation is used to design a general
Monte Carlo wave function method that enables the stochastic treatment of the
full non-Markovian behavior of open quantum systems. Numerical simulations are
carried out which demonstrate that the method is applicable to open systems
strongly coupled to a bosonic reservoir, as well as to the interaction with a
spin bath. Full details of the simulation algorithms are given, together with
an investigation of the dynamics of fluctuations. Several potential
generalizations of the method are outlined.

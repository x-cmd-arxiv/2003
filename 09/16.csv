0.06 R_vir, while at smaller radii the gas produces a central core. Gas
temperatures are almost isothermal out to 0.2 R_vir, then steeply decrease

motions are isotropic to slightly tangential, and contribute to the total
pressure support. We test our model using a generalization of the hydrostatic
equilibrium equation, where the gas motion is properly taken into account. We
find that our fits provide an accurate description of the system: the gas is in
equilibrium and is a good tracer the overall cluster potential if all terms are
taken into account, while simpler assumptions, as the beta-model, cause

that the X-ray properties of 4 Draconis are consistent with the presence of an

least one scalar field with a mass of order H_0. If such a field exists, then
it is generally assumed that its coupling to matter must be tuned to
unnaturally small values in order to satisfy the tests of the Equivalence
Principle (EP). In this paper, we present an alternative explanation which
allows scalar fields to evolve cosmologically while having couplings to matter
of order unity. In our scenario, the mass of the fields depends on the local
matter density: the interaction range is typically of order 1 mm on Earth
(where the density is high) and of order 10-10^4 AU in the solar system (where
the density is low). All current bounds from tests of General Relativity are
satisfied. Nevertheless, we predict that near-future experiments that will test
gravity in space will measure an effective Newton's constant different by order
unity from that on Earth, as well as EP violations stronger than currently
allowed by laboratory experiments. Such outcomes would constitute a smoking gun
for our scenario.

with beta=0.35. This stands in an apparent contradiction to the CDM prediction
of beta~1, and the disagreement worsens if adiabatic compression of the dark
matter by the infalling baryons is considered. Following El-Zant, Shlosman &
Hoffman (2001), we argue that dynamical friction acting on galaxies moving
within the dark matter background counters the effect of adiabatic compression
by transfering the orbital energy of galaxies to the dark matter, thus heating
up and softening the central density cusp. Using N-body simulations of massive
solid clumps moving in clusters we show that indeed the inner dark matter
distribution flattens (with beta approx 0.35 for a cluster like MS2137-23) when
the galaxies spiral inward. We find as a robust result that while the dark
matter distribution becomes core-like, the overall mass distribution preserves
its cuspy nature, in agreement with X-ray and lensing observations of clusters.

across the observable Universe, and at least some of them are associated with
galaxies. A GRB within our own Ggalaxy could do considerable damage to the
Earth's biosphere; rate estimates suggest that a dangerously near GRB should
occur on average two or more times per billion years. At least five times in
the history of life, the Earth experienced mass extinctions that eliminated a
large percentage of the biota. Many possible causes have been documented, and
GRB may also have contributed. The late Ordovician mass extinction
approximately 440 million years ago may be at least partly the result of a GRB.
A special feature of GRB in terms of terrestrial effects is a nearly impulsive
energy input of order 10 s. Due to expected severe depletion of the ozone
layer, intense solar ultraviolet radiation would result from a nearby GRB, and
some of the patterns of extinction and survivorship at this time may be
attributable to elevated levels of UV radiation reaching the Earth. In addition
a GRB could trigger the global cooling which occurs at the end of the
Ordovician period that follows an interval of relatively warm climate. Intense
rapid cooling and glaciation at that time, previously identified as the
probable cause of this mass extinction, may have resulted from a GRB.

Hyi that were obtained with XMM-Newton during the quiescent state. The X-ray
spectrum indicates the presence of an optically thin plasma in the boundary
layer that cools as it settles onto the white dwarf. The plasma has a
continuous temperature distribution that is well described by a power-law or a
cooling flow model with a maximum temperature of 6-8 keV. We estimate from the
X-ray spectrum a boundary layer luminosity of 8*10^30 erg/s, which is only 20
per cent of the disk luminosity. The rate of accretion onto the white dwarf is
5*10^-12 solar masses per year, about half of the rate in the disk. From the
high-resolution X-ray spectra, we estimate that the X-ray emitting part of the
boundary layer is rotating with a velocity of 540 km/s, which is close the
rotation velocity of the white dwarf but significantly smaller than the
Keplerian velocity. We detect a 60-s quasi-periodic oscillation of the X-ray
flux that is likely due to the rotation of the boundary layer. The X-ray and
the ultra-violet flux show strong variability on a time scale of ~1500 s. We
find that the variability in the two bands is correlated and that the X-ray
fluctuations are delayed by ~100 s. The correlation indicates that the variable
ultra-violet flux is emitted near the transition region between the disk and
the boundary layer and that accretion rate fluctuations in this region are
propagated to the X-ray emitting part of the boundary layer within ~100 s. An
orbital modulation of the X-ray flux suggests that the inner accretion disk is
tilted with respect to the orbital plane. The elemental abundances in the
boundary layer are close to their solar values.

theoretical spectra of radiation transfered through a stratified cloud with
constant pressure (instead of constant density) computed by code {\sc titan} in

shows 13.5 s X-ray pulsations in the high state of the super-orbital period
which allows us to measure the mid-eclipse time during this observation.
Combining this with two other mid-eclipse times derived earlier with the ASCA,
we derived a new estimate of the orbital period derivative. Pulse-phase
averaged spectroscopy in the high and low states shows that the energy spectrum
in the 0.1 - 10 keV band comprises of a hard power-law, a soft excess, and a
strong iron emission line. The continuum flux is found to decrease by a factor
of ~ 60 in the low state while the decrease in the iron line flux is only by a
factor of ~ 12, suggesting a different site for the production of the line
emission. In the low state, we have not found any significant increase in the
absorption column density. The X-ray emission is found to come from a very
large region, comparable to the size of the companion star. Pulse phase
resolved spectroscopy in the high state shows a pulsating nature of the soft
spectral component with some phase offset compared to the hard X-rays, as is

to deviate from the self-similar scaling with temperature. Using
N-body/hydrodynamic simulations of the LCDM cosmology, we demonstrate that this

excess entropy in clusters. While radiative cooling increases the entropy of
intracluster gas, resulting in a good match to the data in the centres of
clusters, it produces an entropy-temperature relation closer to the
self-similar scaling at larger radii. A model that includes feedback from
galaxies, however, not only stabilises the cooling rate in the simulation, but
is capable of reproducing the observed scaling behaviour both in cluster cores
and at large radii. Feedback modifies the entropy distribution in clusters due
to its increasing ability at expelling gas from haloes with decreasing mass.
The strength of the feedback required, as suggested from our simulations, is
consistent with supernova energetics, providing a large fraction of the energy

three galaxy clusters, Abell 400, Abell 2634 and Hydra A, in order to estimate
cluster magnetic field strengths, length scales and power spectra. This
analysis is based on the assumption that the magnetic fields are statistically
isotropically distributed across the Faraday screen. We investigate the
difficulties involved in the application of the analysis to observational data.
We derive magnetic power spectra for the three clusters and discuss influences
on their shapes. We show that magnetic fluctuations are probed on length scales
ranging over at least one order of magnitude. Using this range for the
determination of central cluster magnetic field strength yields 3 muG in Abell
2634, 6 muG in Abell 400 and 12 muG in Hydra A. The magnetic field
autocorrelation length was determined to be 4.9 kpc for Abell 2634, 3.6 kpc for
Abell 400 and 0.9 kpc for Hydra A. We show that the RM autocorrelation length
is larger than the magnetic field autocorrelation length. We investigate in a
response analysis if it is possible to determine spectral slopes of the power
spectra. We find that integrated numbers can be determined from this analysis
but differential parameters such as spectral slopes have to be treated
differently. Our response analysis results in spectral slopes of the power
spectra of spectral indices alpha = 1.6 to 2.0 suggesting that Kolmogorov
spectra are possible but flatter spectral slopes than alpha = 1.3 can be
excluded.

astrophysical sources with varying gravitational mass. Here we show that
relativistic fireballs, considered in modelling gamma-ray burst phenomena, are
likely to radiate monopole gravitational waves from high-pressure plasma with
varying Whittaker's mass. Also, ejection of a significant amount of initial
mass-energy of the progenitor contributes to the monopole gravitational
radiation. We identify monopole waves with h^11+h^22 waves of Eddington's

briefly reviewing the earlier research and describing the current problems on

turbulence and vortex filament dynamics. Superfluid turbulence was recently
shown to have an energy spectrum consistent with the Kolmogorov law, which is
an important statistical law in fully developed classical turbulence. We
describe the diffusion of an inhomogeneous vortex tangle with relation to the
observed decay of vortices at very low temperatures. We also describe the
vortex states that appear in a rotating channel with counterflow. The
competition between rotational effects and counterflow effects makes a new
state of ""a polarized vortex tangle"". Next, we discuss recent numerical
analysis of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the specific field of atomic-gas
Bose-Einstein condensation. Consistent with observations, the simulated
condensate starts an elliptic oscillation after the rotation is turned on,
which induces the surface-mode excitations. The vortices develop from these
surface excitations and then enter the bulk condensate, eventually forming a
vortex lattice. When a condensate is held in a quadratic-plus-quartic combined

weak-field approximation for the spacetime geometry of a point particle. The
heuristic is based on Newtonian gravity, the notion of local inertial frames
[the Einstein equivalence principle], plus the use of Galilean coordinate
transformations to connect the freely falling local inertial frames back to the
``fixed stars''. Because of the heuristic and quasi-Newtonian manner in which
the spacetime geometry is obtained, we are at best justified in expecting it to
be a weak-field approximation to the true spacetime geometry. However, in the
case of a spherically symmetric point mass the result is coincidentally an
exact solution of the full vacuum Einstein field equations -- it is the
Schwarzschild geometry in Painleve--Gullstrand coordinates.
  This result is much stronger than the well-known result of Michell and
Laplace whereby a Newtonian argument correctly estimates the value of the
Schwarzschild radius -- using the heuristic presented in this article one
obtains the entire Schwarzschild geometry. The heuristic also gives sensible
results -- a Riemann flat geometry -- when applied to a constant gravitational
field. Furthermore, a subtle extension of the heuristic correctly reproduces
the Reissner--Nordstrom geometry and even the de Sitter geometry. Unfortunately
the heuristic construction is not truly generic. For instance, it is incapable
of generating the Kerr geometry or anti-de Sitter space.
  Despite this limitation, the heuristic does have useful pedagogical value in
that it provides a simple and direct plausibility argument for the
Schwarzschild geometry.

into 2 gamma rays, making neutron stars gamma-ray sources. In this letter, we
strengthen considerably the limits on the radius of compactification of

of a domain wall and an anti-wall. A left-handed 2-d fermion localized on the
domain wall and a right-handed fermion localized on the anti-wall communicate
with each other through the 3-d bulk. In this way they are bound together to
form a Dirac fermion of mass m. As a consequence of asymptotic freedom of the
2-d Gross-Neveu model, the 2-d correlation length \xi = 1/m increases
exponentially with the brane separation. Hence, from the low-energy point of
view of a 2-d observer, the separation of the branes appears very small and the
world becomes indistinguishable from a 2-d space-time. Our toy model provides a
mechanism for brane stabilization: branes made of fermions may be stable due to
their baryon asymmetry. Ironically, our brane world is stable only if it has an
extreme baryon asymmetry with all states in this ``world'' being completely

terms of the spectral variation of a normal operator and its compression to the
orthogonal complement of a trace vector. Using a theorem of Gauss-Lucas type
for normal operators, we relate the problem of locating the critical points of
complex polynomials to the more general problem of describing the relationships

and one other hypothesis, we show that the BGG category $\mathcal{O}$ is
abelian, finite length, and self-dual.
  We decompose $\mathcal{O}$ as a direct sum of blocks $\calo(\la)$, and show
that each block is a highest weight category.

  of European Control Conference 2003, Cambridge, UK",,,,"math.OC math.DS",,"  We propose a new method to design adaptation algorithms that guarantee a
certain prescribed level of performance and are applicable to systems with
nonconvex parameterization. The main idea behind the method is, given the
desired performance characteristics and a class of nonlinearly parameterized
systems, first to augment the tuning error function and design the adaptation
scheme in the form of ordinary differential equations. The resulting
augmentation is allowed to depend on state derivatives. To deal with these, we
suggest the realization of the adaptation scheme in an algebraic-integral form.
Because of the explicit dependance on the state of the original system such
adaptation schemes are referred to as adaptive algorithms in it finite form
instead of differential ones. Sufficient conditions for the existence of finite
form realizations are proposed. These conditions lead to the necessity to find
a solution of a system of partial differential equations, which in general is
not an easy task. In order to resolve this problem we suggest to embed the
original system dynamics into one of a higher order, thus replacing it by a
simple integration of a function with respect to a single scalar argument.
Several full-state feedback finite form realizations are presented and
illustrated with examples.

stretching-induced, long-lived intermediates including non-native helices. This
is first shown for a set of generic structural motifs found in larger RNA

which exhibits a surprisingly well-structured and reproducible unfolding
pathway under mechanical stretching. Using out-of-equilibrium stochastic
simulations, we demonstrate that these experimental results reflect the slow
relaxation of RNA structural rearrangements. Hence, micromanipulations of

intermediates, so-called ""kinetic traps"", thereby capturing -at the single

  effects of inhomogeneity and nonstationarity","45 pages, 18 figures",,"10.1029/2003JC002119",,"physics.ao-ph",,"  The properties of mesoscale Lagrangian turbulence in the Adriatic Sea are
studied from a drifter data set spanning 1990-1999, focusing on the role of
inhomogeneity and nonstationarity. A preliminary study is performed on the
dependence of the turbulent velocity statistics on bin averaging, and a
preferential bin scale of 0.25 is chosen. Comparison with independent estimates
obtained using an optimized spline technique confirms this choice. Three main
regions are identified where the velocity statistics are approximately
homogeneous: the two boundary currents, West (East) Adriatic Current, WAC
(EAC), and the southern central gyre, CG. The CG region is found to be
characterized by symmetric probability density function of velocity,
approximately exponential autocorrelations and well defined integral quantities
such as di usivity and time scale. The boundary regions, instead, are
significantly asymmetric with skewness indicating preferential events in the
direction of the mean flow. The autocorrelation in the along mean flow
direction is characterized by two time scales, with a secondary exponential
with slow decay time of 11-12 days particularly evident in the EAC region.
Seasonal partitioning of the data shows that this secondary scale is especially
prominent in the summer-fall season. Possible physical explanations for the
secondary scale are discussed in terms of low frequency fluctuations of
forcings and in terms of mean flow curvature inducing fluctuations in the
particle trajectories. Consequences of the results for transport modelling in
the Adriatic Sea are discussed.

that if a system S adapts to a class of external signals U, in the sense of
egulation against disturbances or tracking signals in U, then S must ecessarily
contain a subsystem which is capable of generating all the signals in U. It is
not assumed that regulation is robust, nor is there a prior requirement for the
system to be partitioned into separate plant and controller components.
Instead, one assumes that a ``signal detection'' property holds. The result was
motivated by questions of adaptation in bacterial chemotaxis, but the general
mathematical principle is of wide applicability.

method that has the following unique feature: It allows to construct efficient
quantum circuits in a systematic way by reusing and combining a set of highly
optimized quantum circuits. Specifically, the method realizes a quantum circuit
for a given unitary matrix by implementing a linear combination of representing
matrices of a group, which have known fast quantum circuits. We motivate and
illustrate this method by deriving extremely efficient quantum circuits for the
discrete Hartley transform and for the fractional Fourier transforms. The sound
mathematical basis of this design method allows to give meaningful and natural
interpretations of the resulting circuits. We demonstrate this aspect by giving
a natural interpretation of known teleportation circuits.

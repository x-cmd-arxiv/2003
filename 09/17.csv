evolution of the star formation history in clusters. Luminous galaxies with
$M_V \leq -20$ and post-starburst/post-starforming (k+a) spectra which
constitute a significant fraction of galaxies in distant cluster samples are
absent in Coma, where spectacular cases of k+a spectra are found instead at
$M_V>-18.5$ and represent a significant proportion of the cluster dwarf galaxy
population. A simple inspection of their positions on the sky indicates that
this type of galaxy does not show a preferential location within the cluster,
but the bluest and strongest-lined group of k+a's lies in projection towards
the central 1.4 Mpc of Coma and have radial velocities significantly higher
than the cluster mean. We find a striking correlation between the positions of
these young and strong post-starburst galaxies and substructure in the hot
intracluster medium (ICM) identified from {\it XMM-Newton} data, with these
galaxies lying close to the edges of two infalling substructures. This result
strongly suggests that the interaction with the dense ICM could be responsible
for the quenching of the star formation (thus creating the k+a spectrum), and
possibly, for any previous starburst. The evolution with redshift of the
luminosity distribution of k+a galaxies can be explained by a ``downsizing
effect'', with the maximum luminosity/mass of actively star-forming galaxies
infalling onto clusters decreasing at lower redshift. We discuss the possible
physical origin of this downsizing effect and the implications of our results
for current scenarios of environmental effects on the star formation in
galaxies.

of high-mass X-ray binaries provides a simple model: donor stars of initial
masses M_2 > 15 Msun transfer mass on their thermal timescales to black holes
of masses M_1 > 10 Msun.
  For alternative explanations of the Cartwheel ULX population in terms of
intermediate-mass black holes (IMBH) accreting from massive stars, the inferred
production rate > 10^-6 yr^-1 implies at least 300 IMBHs, and more probably 3 x
10^4, within the star-forming ring. These estimates are increased by factors
eta^-1 if the efficiency eta with which IMBHs find companions of > 15 Msun
within 10^7 yr is <1. Current models of IMBH production would require a very
large mass ($\ga 10^{10}\msun$) of stars to have formed new clusters. Further,
the accretion efficiency must be low (< 6 x 10^-3) for IMBH binaries,
suggesting super-Eddington accretion, even though intermediate black hole
masses are invoked with the purpose of avoiding it.
  These arguments suggest either that to make a ULX, an IMBH must accrete from
some as yet unknown non-stellar mass reservoir with very specific properties,
or that most if not all ULXs in star-forming galaxies are high-mass X-ray
binaries.

Considering galaxies as a whole, we find that in a broad mass range,

proportional to the stellar mass of the host galaxy. Within the accuracy of the

consistent with the average luminosity function derived from all data. The
average XLF of LMXBs in nearby galaxies has a complex shape and is
significantly different from that of HMXBs. It follows a power law with a

This event was extremely soft: the ratio log(S_X/S_gamma) = 0.7, where S_X and
S_gamma are the fluences in the 2-30 and 30-400 keV energy bands, is the most
extreme value observed so far by HETE-2. In addition, the spectrum has an
observed peak energy E^{obs}_{peak} < 5.0 keV (99.7 % probability upper limit)
and no photons were detected above ~10 keV. The burst is shorter at higher
energies, which is similar to the behavior of long GRBs. We consider the
possibility that the burst lies at very high redshift and that the low value of
E^{obs}_{peak} is due to the cosmological redshift, and show that this is very
unlikely. We find that the properties of XRF 020903 are consistent with the
relation between the fluences S(7-30 keV) and S(30-400 keV) found by Barraud et
al. for GRBs and X-ray-rich GRBs, and are consistent with the extension by a
decade of the hardness-intensity correlation (Mallozzi et al. 1995) found by
the same authors. Assuming that XRF 020903 lies at a redshift z = 0.25 as
implied by the host galaxy of the candidate optical and radio afterglows of
this burst, we find that the properties of XRF 020903 are consistent with an
extension by a factor ~300 of the relation between the isotropic-equivalent
energy E_iso and the peak E_peak of the nu F_nu spectrum (in the source frame
of the burst) found by Amati et al. for GRBs. The results presented in this
paper therefore provide evidence that XRFs, X-ray-rich GRBs, and GRBs form a
continuum and are a single phenomenon. The results also impose strong
constraints on models of XRFs and X-ray-rich GRBs.

(XRFs) and GRBs form a continuum, and therefore that these two types of bursts
are the same phenomenon. We show that both the structured jet and the uniform
jet models can explain the observed properties of GRBs reasonably well.
However, if one tries to account for the properties of both XRFs and GRBs in a
unified picture, the uniform jet model works reasonably well while the
structured jet model does not. The uniform jet model of XRFs and GRBs implies
that most GRBs have very small jet opening angles (~ half a degree). This
suggests that magnetic fields play a crucial role in GRB jets. The model also
implies that the energy radiated in gamma rays is ~100 times smaller than has
been thought. Most importantly, the model implies that there are ~10^4 -10^5
more bursts with very small jet opening angles for every such burst we see.
Thus the rate of GRBs could be comparable to the rate of Type Ic core collapse
supernovae. Determination of the spectral parameters and redshifts of many more
XRFs will be required in order to confirm or rule out the uniform jet model and
its implications. HETE-2 is ideally suited to do this (it has localized 16 XRFs
in ~2 years), whereas Swift is less so. The unique insights into the structure
of GRBs jets, the rate of GRBs, and the nature of Type Ic supernovae that XRFs
may provide therefore constitute a compelling scientific case for continuing
HETE-2 during the Swift mission.

high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) in the X-ray flux from
accreting black hole binary systems. In at least two systems, these HFQPOs come
in pairs with a 2:3 frequency commensurability. We propose a simple ``hot
spot'' model to explain the position and amplitude of the HFQPO peaks. Using
the exact geodesic equations for the Kerr metric, we calculate the trajectories
of massive test particles, which are treated as isotropic, monochromatic
emitters in their rest frames. Photons are traced from the accretion disk to a
distant observer to produce time- and frequency-dependent images of the
orbiting hot spot and background disk. The power spectrum of the X-ray light
curve consists of multiple peaks at integral combinations of the black hole
coordinate frequencies. In particular, if the radial frequency is one-third of
the azimuthal frequency (as is the case near the inner-most stable circular
orbit), beat frequencies appear in the power spectrum at two-thirds and
four-thirds of the fundamental azimuthal orbital frequency, in agreement with
observations. We also model the effects of shearing the hot spot in the disk,
producing an arc of emission that also follows a geodesic orbit, as well as the
effects of non-planar orbits that experience Lens-Thirring precession around
the black hole axis. By varying the arc length, we are able to explain the
different QPO features observed in ``Type A'' and ``Type B'' X-ray outbursts
from XTE J1550-564. In the context of this model, the observed power spectra
allow us to infer values for the black hole mass and angular momentum, and also
constrain the parameters of the model, such as the hot spot size and
luminosity.

study their physical properties. We find E+A's comprise a non-negligible
component (~7-13%) of the cluster population at these redshifts, and their
diverse nature indicates a heterogeneous parent population. Cluster E+A's span
the range in Hubble type and cover a wide range in luminosity, internal
velocity dispersion, and half-light radius. From their velocity dispersions and
half-light radii, we infer that the descendants of E+A's in our highest
redshift cluster are massive early-type galaxies. We find a decrease in the
characteristic E+A mass similar to the decrease in luminosity of rapidly
star-forming field galaxies since z~1, i.e. galaxy ``down-sizing.'' In
addition, we argue our statistics imply that >30% of the E-S0 members have
undergone an E+A phase; the true fraction could be 100% if the effects of E+A
down-sizing, an increasing E+A fraction with redshift, and the conversion of
spirals into early-types are also considered. Thus, the E+A phase may indeed be

  Explosions"", Austin, Texas",,,,"astro-ph",,"  HETE-2 has confirmed the connection between GRBs and Type Ic supernovae. Thus
we now know that the progenitors of long GRBs are massive stars. HETE-2 has
also provided strong evidence that the properties of X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) and
GRBs form a continuum, and therefore that these two types of bursts are the
same phenomenon. We show that both the structured jet and the uniform jet
models can explain the observed properties of GRBs reasonably well. However, if
one tries to account for the properties of both XRFs and GRBs in a unified
picture, the uniform jet model works reasonably well while the structured jet
model fails utterly. The uniform jet model of XRFs and GRBs implies that most
GRBs have very small jet opening angles (~ half a degree). This suggests that
magnetic fields play a crucial role in GRB jets. The model also implies that
the energy radiated in gamma rays is ~100 times smaller than has been thought.
Most importantly, the model implies that there are ~10^4 -10^5 more bursts with
very small jet opening angles for every such burst we see. Thus the rate of
GRBs could be comparable to the rate of Type Ic core collapse supernovae.
Accurate, rapid localizations of many XRFs, leading to identification of their
X-ray and optical afterglows and the determination of their redshifts, will be
required in order to confirm or rule out these profound implications. HETE-2 is
ideally suited to do this (it has localized 16 XRFs in ~2 years), whereas Swift
is not. The unique insights into the structure of GRB jets, the rate of GRBs,
and the nature of Type Ic supernovae that XRFs may provide therefore constitute
a compelling scientific case for continuing HETE-2 during the Swift mission.

carefully chosen sample of six clusters each containing a dominant brightest
cluster galaxy. We use these systems to study the relative distributions of
dark and baryonic material in the central regions. Three clusters present both
radial and tangential arcs and provide particularly strong constraints on the
mass profiles, whereas the other three display only tangential arcs and act as
a control set. We analyze stellar velocity dispersion data for the brightest
cluster galaxies in conjunction with the arc redshifts and lens models to
constrain the dark and baryonic mass profiles jointly. For the systems
containing radial arcs we find that the inner dark matter density profile is
consistent with a 3-D distribution, rho_{DM} propto r^-beta, with logarithmic
slope <beta>=0.52^{+0.05}_{-0.05} (68% CL). Similarly, we find that the
tangential arc sample gives an upper limit, beta<0.57 (99% CL). Taking the 6
clusters together, the mean dark matter distribution is quite inconsistent with
the standard Navarro, Frenk & White (1997) value, beta=1.0, at >99% confidence.
In addition, we find considerable cosmic scatter in the beta (Delta beta ~0.3)
values of the radial arc sample. We find no evidence that systems with radial
arcs preferentially yield flatter dark matter profiles as might be expected if
they were a biased subset. We discuss the validity of our 1-D mass
reconstruction method and verify its conclusions by comparing with results of a
more rigorous ray-tracing lensing code. Our results extend and strengthen the
earlier conclusions presented by Sand et al. (2002) and suggest the
relationship between dark and visible matter in the cores of clusters is more
complex than anticipated from recent simulations. (abridged)

surveys, we determine the ratio of infrared to X-ray brightness that would be
observed by SIRTF and Chandra for objects with the same spectral shapes as
nearby starbursts if seen at high redshift. The parameter IR/X is defined as
IR/X = (flux density observed in SIRTF MIPS 24 $\mu$m filter in mJy)/(total
flux observed within 0.5-2.0 keV in units of 10^-16 ergs\s\cm^2). Based on
observations of NGC 4038/39 (``The Antennae''), NGC 3690+IC 694 (Arp 299 or Mkn

spectra taken by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and X-ray spectra
obtained with Chandra . The IR/X are determined as they would appear for 1<z<3.
The mean IR/X over this redshift range is 1.3 and is not a significant function
of redshift or luminosity, indicating that SIRTF surveys reaching 0.4 mJy at 24
$\mu$m should detect the same starbursts as deep CXO surveys detect at a flux
of 0.3x10^-16 ergs/s/cm^2. The lower bound of IR/X for starbursts is about 0.2,
suggesting that objects with IR/X smaller than this have an AGN X-ray component
in addition to the starburst. Values of IR/X for the obscured AGN within NGC
1068, the Circinus galaxy, and NGC 6240 are also determined for comparison
although interpretation is complicated by the circumnuclear starbursts in these

implication is that there is substantial enrichment of the quasar environment,

derived from these features is z = 5.774 +/- 0.003, more accurate and slightly
lower than the z = 5.82 reported in the discovery paper based on the
partially-absorbed Lyman-alpha emission line. The infrared continuum is

provide a physical explanation for the Calzetti Law based on a turbulent
interstellar medium. In essence, this provides a log-normal distribution of
column densities, giving a wide range of column densities in the dusty
foreground screen. Therefore, extended sources such as starburst regions or HII
regions seen through it suffer a point-to-point stochastic extinction and
reddening. Regions of high column densities are ""black"" in the UV, but
translucent in the IR, which leads to a flatter extinction law, and a larger
value of the total to selective extinction, R_V. We fit the Calzetti Law, and
infer that the variance sigma of the log-normal distribution lies in the range
0.6<sigma<2.2. The absolute to selective extinction R_V is found to be in the

silicate-graphite grains or by a composition of pure graphite grains. A
composition of pure iron grains on the other hand can be excluded and a pure
silicate composition does not seem to be very likely. The dust-to-gas ratio in
the interaction zone is ~0.01%, an order of magnitude lower than estimates for
dust abundances in the winds of red supergiant (RSG) stars in the LMC. This low
dust abundance can be accounted for by a combination of evaporation through the
UV-flash from the supernova outburst and subsequent sputtering in the shocked
gas. For this explanation to hold, dust in the pre-supernova circumstellar

ZZ Ceti stars. We have also analyzed additional spectra of known nonvariable
white dwarfs in the vicinity of the ZZ Ceti instability strip. Our study
further strengthens the idea that ZZ Ceti stars occupy a pure region in the log
g-Teff plane, a region where no nonvariable stars are found. This result
supports the thesis that ZZ Ceti pulsators represent a phase through which all
DA stars must evolve.

positive ion, in a zero metallicity gas at low temperature and intermediate to
high density. It therefore affects both the number of free electrons and the
opacity of the gas. The most recent H3+ partition function (Neale and Tennyson,
1995, ApJ, 454, L169) is an order of magnitude larger at 4000 K than all
previous partition functions, implying that H3+ is a more important electron
donor than previously thought.
  Here we present new Rosseland mean opacities for a hydrogen-helium gas of
1000 < T(K) < 9000 and -14 < log10(density [g/cc]) < -2. In the calculation of
these opacities we have made use of the latest collision induced absorption
data as well as the most recent H3+ partition function and line opacity data.
It is shown that these updated and new sources of opacity give rise to a
Rosseland mean opacity for a hydrogen-helium gas which is in general greater
than that calculated in earlier works.
  The new opacity data are then used to model the evolution of low mass
0.15-0.8 Mo zero metallicity stars, from pre-Main Sequence collapse to Main
Sequence turn-off. To investigate the effect of H3+ on the evolution of low
mass zero metallicity stars, we repeat our calculations neglecting H3+ as a
source of electrons and line opacity. We find that H3+ can have an effect on
the structure and evolution of stars of mass ~0.5 Mo or less. A gray atmosphere
is used for the calculation, which is sufficient to demonstrate that H3+
affects the evolution of very low mass stars to a greater degree than
previously believed.

relevant in the regulation of translation. After elongation and detachment from
the 3' termination site of mRNA, parts of the ribosome machinery can diffuse
back to the initiation site, especially if it is held nearby, enhancing overall
translation rates. The elongation steps of the mRNA-bound ribosomes are modeled
using exact and asymptotic results of the totally asymmetric exclusion process
(TASEP).Since the ribosome injection rates of the TASEP depend on the local
concentrations at the initiation site, a source of ribosomes emanating from the
termination end can feed back to the initiation site, leading to a
self-consistent set of equations for the steady-state ribosome throughput.
Additional mRNA binding factors can also promote loop formation, or
cyclization, bringing the initiation and termination sites into close
proximity. The probability distribution of the distance between the initiation
and termination sites is described using simple noninteracting polymer models.
We find that the initiation, or initial ribosome adsorption binding required
for maximal throughput can vary dramatically depending on certain values of the
bulk ribosome concentration and diffusion constant. If cooperative interactions
among the loop-promoting proteins and the initiation/termination sites are
considered, the throughput can be further regulated in a nonmonotonic manner.
Potential experiments to test the hypothesized physical mechanisms are
discussed.

Employment of a special oxygen-getter-controlled low-O2-pressure encapsulation
technique for the sample synthesis enabled us to use long heating periods
without evident evaporation of Mo, and thereby reach the thermal equilibrium
state and a high degree of B-site cation order. For samples fired at 1150C for

partial substitution of divalent Sr by trivalent Nd (0 < x < 0.2). The Fe
valence and the degree of B-site order were probed by 57Fe Mossbauer
spectroscopy. Replacing Sr by Nd increased the fraction of Fe and Mo atoms
occupying wrong sites, i.e. antisite disorder. It had very little effect on the
Fe valence: a small but visible increase in the isomer shift was seen for the
mixed-valent FeII/III atoms occupying the right site indicating a slight
movement towards divalency of these atoms, which was more than counterbalanced
by the increase in the fraction of antisite Fe atoms with III valence state. It
is therefore argued that the bulk of the electron doping is received by
antisite Mo atoms, which - being surrounded by six MoV/VI atoms - prefer the
lower IV/V valence state. Thus under Nd substitution, the charge-neutrality
requirement inflicts a lattice disorder such that low-valent MoIV/V can exist.

in superfluids or superconductors exhibiting nematic liquid crystalline orders,

Meissner-Higgs mechanism. The topologically ordered nematic phase suggested by
Lammert, Toner and Rokshar finds a simple interpretation in this framework. The
ordered nematic is a true quantum phase: the dynamical glide principle
interferes with the effect that the phonon spectrum of the crystal re-emerges
in the direction orthogonal to the director. Novel insights follow from the
duality on the fundamental nature of superfluidity and superconductivity. The

further shown to be consistent with a global free energy functional that
invokes an entropy term based on the Boltzmann formula. A more recent approach
by Michael and Johnson maximised a Tsallis entropy function subject to simple
constraints. We show how this approach can be developed from an agent model
where the simple Langevin process is now conditioned by local rather than
global noise. The approach yields a BBGKY type hierarchy of equations for the
system correlation functions. Of especial interest is that the results can be
obtained from a new free energy functional similar to that mentioned above

mean field approximation yields the results of Michael and Johnson. We show how

insignificant effect that Al substitution has on the lattice distortions and
the importance of non-magnetic substitutions. For all the samples, the

carrier excitation: The first, associated with the presence of sharp and
intense lines in the spectrum, is a direct excited state ? ground state
transition. The second, associated with the appearance of up to four much
broader excitation lines, is a LO phonon-assisted absorption directly into the
quantum dot ground states. LO phonons with energies of both quantum dots and
ZnTe barrier material are identified in the photoluminescence excitation
spectra. Resonantly excited PL measurements for the dot ensemble as a function
of excitation energy makes it possible to separate the contributions of these
two mechanisms. We find that for CdTe quantum dots the distribution of excited
states coupled to the ground states reflects the energy distribution of the
quantum dot emission, but shifted up in energy by 100 meV. This large splitting
between excited and ground states in CdTe quantum dots suggests strong spatial
confinement. In contrast, the LO phonon-assisted absorption shows significant
size selectivity. In the case of CdTe dots the exciton-LO phonon coupling is
strongly enhanced for smaller-sized dots which have higher emission energies.
In contrast, for CdSe quantum dots the exciton-LO phonon coupling is uniform
over the ensemble ? that is, the energy distribution determines the intensities
of LO phonon replicas. We show that for CdTe quantum dots after annealing, that
is after an increase in the average dot size, the exciton-LO phonon interaction
reflects the dot energy distribution, as observed for CdSe quantum dots.

on the TeV brane in the Randall-Sundrum type I scenario is presented. The
method enables us to find the form of the metric close to the matter
distribution when its asymptotic form is given. The short range solution is
found as an expansion in the ratio between the Schwarzschild radius of the
black hole and the curvature length of the bulk. Long range properties are
introduced using the linearized gravity solution as an asymptotic boundary
condition. The solution is found up to first order. It is valid in the region
close to the horizon but is not valid on the horizon. The regularity of the

evidence, summarized here, a power spectrum analysis of the Super-Kamiokande

rate observed in the solar magnetic field in the same time period. Three
frequency peaks, all related to this rotation rate, can be explained
quantitatively. A Super-Kamiokande paper reported no time variation of the
flux, but showed the same peaks, there interpreted as statistically
insignificant, due to an inappropriate analysis. This modulation is small (7%)

neutrino process in the convection zone. The data display effects that
correspond to solar-cycle changes in the magnetic field, typical of the
convection zone. This subdominant process requires new physics: a large
neutrino transition magnetic moment and a light sterile neutrino, since an
effect of this amplitude occurring in the convection zone cannot be achieved

supersymmetric seesaw model in light of WMAP. Inflation in this model is
firstly driven by the heavier sneutrino field $\tilde{N}_2$ and then the
lighter field $\tilde{N}_1$. we will show that with the mass ratio $6\lesssim
M_2/M_1 \lesssim 10$ the model predicts a suppressed primordial scalar spectrum
around the largest scales and the predicted CMB TT quadrupole is much better
suppressed than the single sneutrino model. So this model is more favored than
the single sneutrino inflation model. We then consider the implications of the
model on the reheating temperature, leptogenesis and lepton flavor violation.
Our results show that the seesaw parameters are constrained strongly by the
reheating temperature, together with the requirement by a successful inflation.
The mixing between the first generation and the other two generations in the
right-handed neutrino sector is tiny. The rates of lepton flavor violating
processes in our scenario depend on only 4 unknown seesaw parameters through a
'reduced' seesaw formula, besides $U_{e3}$ and the supersymmetric parameters.

R-parity, focusing on minimal supergravity (mSUGRA). We discuss the origins of
lepton number violation in supersymmetry. We have computed the full set of
coupled one-loop renormalization group equations for the gauge couplings, the
superpotential parameters and for all the soft supersymmetry breaking
parameters. We provide analytic formule for the scalar potential minimization
conditions which may be iterated to arbitrary precision. We compute the
low-energy spectrum of the superparticles and the neutrinos as a function of
the small set of parameters at the unification scale in the general basis.
Specializing to mSUGRA, we use the neutrino masses to set new bounds on the
R-parity violating couplings. These bounds are up-to five orders of magnitude
stricter than the previously existing ones. In addition, new bounds on the
R-parity violating couplings are also derived demanding a non-tachyonic
sneutrino spectrum. We investigate the nature of the lightest supersymmetric
particle and find extensive regions in parameter space, where it is not the
neutralino. This leads to a novel set of supersymmetric signatures, which we
classify.

effects of SU(3) breaking in rescattering through Pomeron exchange are studied.
Then, after making a plausible assumption concerning the pattern of SU(3)
breaking in non-Pomeron FSIs, we give general formulas for how the latter
modify short-distance (SD) amplitudes. In the SU(3) limit, these formulas
depend on three effective parameters characterizing the strength of all
non-Pomeron rescattering effects. We point out that the experimental bounds on
the B -> K^+K^- branching ratio may limit the value of only one of these FSI
parameters. Thus, the smallness of the B -> K^+K^- decay rate does not imply
negligible rescattering effects in other decays. Assuming a vanishing value of
this parameter, we perform various fits to the available B -> PP branching
ratios. The fits determine the quark-diagram SD amplitudes, the two remaining
FSI parameters and the weak angle gamma. While the set of all B -> PP branching
ratios is well described with gamma around its expected SM value, the fits
permit other values of gamma as well. For a couple of such good fits, we
predict asymmetries for the B -> K pi, pi^+ eta (eta'), K^+ eta (eta') decays
as well as the values of the CP-violating parameters S_{pi pi} and C_{pi pi}
for the time-dependent rate of B^0(t) -> pi^+ pi^-. Apart from a problem with
the recent B^+ -> pi^+ eta asymmetry measurement, comparison with the data
seems to favour the values of gamma in accordance with SM expectations.

noncommutative version of the model (NCSQED$_4$) the UV/IR mechanism gives rise
to infrared divergences which may spoil the perturbative expansion. In this
work we pursue the study of the consistency of NCSQED$_4$ by working
systematically within the covariant superfield formulation. In the Landau
gauge, it has already been shown for ${\cal N} = 1$ that the gauge field
two-point function is free of harmful UV/IR infrared singularities, in the
one-loop approximation. Here we show that this result holds without
restrictions on the number of allowed supersymmetries and for any arbitrary
covariant gauge. We also investigate the divergence structure of the gauge
field three-point function in the one-loop approximation. It is first proved
that the cancellation of the leading UV/IR infrared divergences is a gauge
invariant statement. Surprisingly, we have also found that there exist
subleading harmful UV/IR infrared singularities whose cancellation only takes
place in a particular covariant gauge. Thus, we conclude that these last
mentioned singularities are in the gauge sector and, therefore, do not
jeopardize the perturbative expansion and/or the renormalization of the theory.

$g_{j}$ at the points of a uniform grid $F_{N}$ generated by conjugacy classes
of elements of finite adjoint order $N$ in the fundamental region $F$ of
compact semisimple Lie groups. The present implementation of the method is for
the groups SU(2), when $F$ is reduced to a one-dimensional segment, and for
$SU(2)\times ... \times SU(2)$ in multidimensional cases. This simplest case
turns out to result in a transform known as discrete cosine transform (DCT),
which is often considered to be simply a specific type of the standard DFT.
Here we show that the DCT is very different from the standard DFT when the
properties of the continuous extensions of these two discrete transforms from
the discrete grid points $t_j; j=0,1, ... N$ to all points $t \in F$ are
considered. (A) Unlike the continuous extension of the DFT, the continuous
extension of (the inverse) DCT, called CEDCT, closely approximates $g(t)$
between the grid points $t_j$. (B) For increasing $N$, the derivative of CEDCT
converges to the derivative of $g(t)$. And (C), for CEDCT the principle of
locality is valid. Finally, we use the continuous extension of 2-dimensional
DCT to illustrate its potential for interpolation, as well as for the data
compression of 2D images.

viscous liquid have been modified considering effects of viscosity and
compressibility more complete than all previous works. A new set of equations
has been derived including new terms resulted from consideration of the
viscosity and compressibility not only at the bubble interface, but also in the
bulk of liquid. The new equations are two non-linear coupled equations, which
can not be merged into one equation unlike all previously derived equations.
Numerical calculations have been performed considering effects of heat and mass
transfer at the bubble interface. The results indicate that the new terms
exhibit an important damping role at the collapse, so that their consideration
dramatically weakens the bubble rebounds after the collapse. Dependence of this
new damping mechanism to amplitude and frequency of the deriving pressure has
been investigated.

  algorithms?",,"Quantum Information & Computation, 4, 201 (2004)",,,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum search is a technique for searching N possibilities in only
O(sqrt(N)) steps. It has been applied in the design of quantum algorithms for
several structured problems. Many of these algorithms require significant
amount of quantum hardware. In this paper we observe that if an algorithm
requires O(P) hardware, it should be considered significant if and only if it
produces a speedup of at least O(sqrt(P)) over a simple quantum search
algorithm. This is because a speedup of $O(sqrt(P)) $ can be trivially obtained
by dividing the search space into $O(P)$ separate parts and handing the problem
to independent processors that do a quantum search. We argue that the known
algorithms for collision and element distinctness fail to be non-trivial in
this sense.

  because of the 24-line limit in quant-ph","Quantum Information and Computation. Vol. 5, No.1 (2005) 40-47.",,,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum-based cryptographic protocols are often said to enjoy security
guaranteed by the fundamental laws of physics. However, even carefully designed
quantum-based cryptographic schemes may be susceptible to subtle attacks that
are outside the original design. As an example, we give attacks against a
recently proposed ``secure communication using mesoscopic coherent states'',
which employs mesoscopic states, rather than single-photon states. Our attacks
can be used either as a known-plaintext attack or in the case where the
plaintext has not been randomized. One of our attacks requires beamsplitters
and the replacement of a lossy channel by a lossless one. It is successful
provided that the original loss in the channel is so big that Eve can obtain
2^k copies of what Bob receives, where k is the length of the seed key
pre-shared by Alice and Bob. Substantial improvements over such an exhaustive
key search attack can be made, whenever a key is reused. Furthermore, we remark
that, under the same assumption of a known or non-random plaintext, Grover's
exhaustive key search attack can be applied directly to ""secure communication
using mesoscopic coherent states"", whenever the channel loss is more than 50
percent. Therefore, as far as information-theoretic security is concerned,
optically amplified signals necessarily degrade the security of the proposed
scheme, when the plaintext is known or non-random. Our attacks apply even if
the mesoscopic scheme is used only for key generation with a subsequent use of
the key for one-time-pad encryption.

(1) the geometric phase of cyclic entangled states with non-degenerate
eigenvalues can always be decomposed into a sum of weighted non-modular pure
state phases pertaining to the separable components of the Schmidt
decomposition, though the same cannot be said in the non-cyclic case, and (2)
the geometric phase of the mixed state of one subsystem is generally different
from that of the entangled state even by keeping the other subsystem fixed, but
the two phases are the same when the evolution operator satisfies conditions
where each component in the Schmidt decomposition is parallel transported.

quantum state in a fixed period of time. Unlike many other schemes for quantum
computation and communication, these networks do not require qubit couplings to
be switched on and off. When restricted to N-qubit spin networks of identical
qubit couplings, we show that 2 log_3 N is the maximal perfect communication
distance for hypercube geometries. Moreover, if one allows fixed but different
couplings between the qubits then perfect state transfer can be achieved over
arbitrarily long distances in a linear chain.

neutralino dark matter in dense, central regions of Milky Way substructure. We
characterize Galactic substructure statistically based on Monte Carlo
realizations of the formation of a Milky Way-like halo using a semi-analytic
method that has been calibrated against the results of high-resolution N-body
simulations. We find that it may be possible for the upcoming experiments GLAST
and VERITAS, working in concert, to detect gamma-rays from dark matter
substructure if the neutralino is relatively light ($\Mchi \lsim 100 \GeV$),
while for $\Mchi \gsim 500 \GeV$ such a detection would be unlikely. We perform
most of our calculations within the framework of the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model; however, we also investigate the robustness of our results
to various assumptions and find that the probability of detection is sensitive
to poorly-constrained input parameters, particularly those that characterize
the primordial power spectrum. Specifically, the best-fitting power spectrum of
the WMAP team, with a running spectral index, predicts roughly a factor of
fifty fewer detectable subhalos compared to the standard $\LCDM$ cosmological
model with scale-invariant power spectrum. We conclude that the lack of a
detected gamma-ray signal gives very little information about the
supersymmetric parameter space due to uncertainties associated with both the
properties of substructure and cosmological parameters.

oscillations in the kink-mode is resonant absorption as a result of the Alfven
speed variation at the outer boundary of coronal loops. Analytical expressions
for the period and damping time exist for loop models with thin non-uniform
boundaries. Here we measure the thickness of the non-uniform layer in
oscillating loops for 11 events, by forward-fitting of the cross-sectional
density profile and line-of-sight integration to the cross-sectional fluxes
observed with TRACE 171 A. This way we model the internal and external electron
density of the coronal plasma in oscillating loops. This allows us to test the
theoretically predicted damping rates for thin boundaries as function of the
density ratio. We find that the density ratio predicted by the damping time is
higher than the density ratio estimated from the background fluxes. The lower
densities modeled from the background fluxes are likely to be a consequence of
the neglected hotter plasma that is not detected with the TRACE 171 A filter.
Taking these correction into account, resonant absorption predicts damping
times of kink-mode oscillations that are commensurable with the observed ones
and provides a new diagnostic of the density contrast of oscillating loops.

hydrostatic equilibrium is determined by radiation pressure and gravitation.
The global structure is that of an n=3 polytrope at the stability limit. Small
relativistic corrections for example can initiate a free fall collapse due to
the 'post Newtonian' instability. Since the outcome of the final collapse -A
super-massive black hole or hypernova- depends sensitively on the structure and
the size of the object, when the instability sets in, it is important to
investigate in more detail the contraction phase of the SMS. If the gaseous
object is embedded in a dense stellar system, the central star cluster, the
interaction and coupling of both components due to dynamical friction changes
the energy balance and evolution of the SMS dramatically. Dynamical friction
between stars and gas, which can be estimated semi-analytically (see Just et
al. 1986), has three different effects on the two-component system. We discuss
in which evolutionary stages and parameter range these interaction processes
are relevant and how they can influence the stability and evolution of the SMS.

we revisit previous observations that have been interpreted in terms of MHD

conclusions: (1) Fast sausage MHD mode oscillations require such a high
electron density imposed by the wave number cutoff that they can only occur in
flare loops; (2) In the previously reported radio observations ($\nu \approx
100$ MHz to 1 GHz) with periods of $P\approx 0.5-5$ s, the fast sausage MHD
mode oscillation is likely to be confined to a small segment (corresponding to
a high harmonic node) near the apex of the loop, rather than involving a global
oscillation over the entire loop length. The recent microwave and soft X-ray

baryon fraction, once the details of halo structure and the adiabatic
contraction of halos due to cooling gas are taken into account. The scatter and
deficiency of baryons within low mass halos ($V_{vir} < 50$ km/s) is consistent
with the expected suppression of gas accretion by photo-evaporation due to the
cosmic UV background at high redshift. The data are not consistent with
significant gas removal from strong supernovae winds unless the velocities of
galaxies measured from their gas kinematics are significantly lower than the
true halo velocities for objects with $V_{vir} < 100$ km/s. Thus models such as
$\Lambda$CDM with a steep mass function of halos may find it difficult to
reproduce both the baryonic mass-velocity relation presented here whilst at the
same time reproducing the flat luminosity/HI function of galaxies. Galaxies
hold about 10% of the baryons in the Universe, which is close to the collapsed
mass fraction expected within hierarchical models on these scales, suggesting a
high efficiency for galaxy formation. Most of the baryons are expected to be
evenly distributed between diffuse intergalactic gas in low density

magnetic field changes randomly due to hydromagnetic turbulence driven by the

by the time scale for amplifying magnetic fields up to a dynamically important
level. Poynting flux-dominated jets with reversing B-fields provide a natural
and efficient way to dissipate energy via the reconnection process. Gamma-rays
are produced at the spatially separated reconnection sites. In this scenario,
the emergent synchrotron radiation can be highly polarized and can form both

of the CMBR caused by scattering, known as thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect,
along the radial axis of the medium is compared with the analytical solution of
Kompaneets equation. The X-ray data of several clusters of galaxies at low

the order $10^{-3}$. It is found that for this value of $n_0$ the effect of
multiple scattering is negligible. The numerically calculated anisotropy along
the radial axis matches well with the analytical solution that describes single
scattering. The result incorporating multiple scattering is fitted with the
recent observation of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in the cluster Abell 2163. It
is shown that if $n_0$ is greater by an order of magnitude, which could be
possible for cluster of galaxies at comparatively higher redshift, multiple
scattering would play a significant role at the Wien region of the anisotropy
spectrum. A fitting formula for the correction to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect

dissipations at the all cosmic times accessible to CMB spectrum investigations

and that most of the quasars are at Gigaparsec distances. However, there are
some cases where several quasars with completely different redshifts and a
nearby active galaxy are aligned in a certain way or occupy a very small patch
on the sky, which is claimed by some authors to be unlikely to happen by
chance. Is there a small subset of quasars with non-cosmological redshifts? For
quasars apparently associated with galaxies, we consider two scenarios for the
origin of their redshift: 1. a standard, cosmological scenario, 2. a
velocity-induced Doppler shift of a nearby object's spectrum (local, ejection
scenario). We argue for a simple astrometric test which can distinguish between
these two sources of quasar redshifts by constraining their proper motions.
  We give the predictions for the maximum possible proper motions of a quasar
for the cosmological and local scenarios of the origin of their redshifts. We
apply these theoretical results to the Bukhmastova (2001) catalog, which
contains more than 8000 close QSO-galaxy associations. In the standard
interpretation of quasar redshifts, their typical proper motions are a fraction
of micro arc-second, and beyond the reach of planned astrometric missions like
GAIA and SIM. On the other hand, the quasars ejected from local AGNs at
velocities close to the speed of light would have proper motions 5-6 orders of
magnitude larger, which would easily be measurable with future astrometric
missions. The distributions of proper motions for the cosmological and local
scenarios are very well separated. Moreover, the division corresponds nicely to
the expected accuracy from GAIA and SIM.

the electronic magnetotransport in single-crystalline EuB$_6$. Magnetization,
magnetoresistance and Hall effect data were recorded at temperatures between 2
and 300 K and in magnetic fields up to 5.5 T. The negative magnetoresistance is
well reproduced by a model in which the spin disorder scattering is reduced by
the applied magnetic field. The Hall effect can be separated into an ordinary
and an anomalous part. At 20 K the latter accounts for half of the observed
Hall voltage, and its importance decreases rapidly with increasing temperature.
As for Gd and its compounds, where the rare-earth ion adopts the same Hund's
rule ground state as Eu$^{2+}$ in EuB$_{6}$, the standard antisymmetric
scattering mechanisms underestimate the $size$ of this contribution by several
orders of magnitude, while reproducing its $shape$ almost perfectly. Well below
the bulk ferromagnetic ordering at $T_C$ = 12.5 K, a two-band model

indeed cause the link length distribution to converge to a power law, achieving
a routing time of O(log^2 n) on networks of size n. We also study finite-size

explain the power law tail of price fluctuations. The main points of their
theory are that volume fluctuations, which have a power law tail with exponent
roughly -1.5, are modulated by the average market impact function, which
describes the response of prices to transactions. They argue that the average
market impact function follows a square root law, which gives power law tails
for prices with exponent roughly -3. We demonstrate that the long-memory nature
of order flow invalidates their statistical analysis of market impact, and
present a more careful analysis that properly takes this into account. This
makes it clear that the functional form of the average market impact function
varies from market to market, and in some cases from stock to stock. In fact,
for both the London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange the average
market impact function grows much slower than a square root law; this implies
that the exponent for price fluctuations predicted by modulations of volume
fluctuations is much too big. We find that for LSE stocks the distribution of
transaction volumes does not even have a power law tail. This makes it clear
that volume fluctuations do not determine the power law tail of price returns.

relative orientation of the donor atoms, an issue of crucial importance in the
construction silicon-based spin quantum computers. In this article we calculate
the donor electron exchange coupling as a function of donor position
incorporating the full Bloch structure of the Kohn-Luttinger electron

terms they produce, the periodic part of the Bloch functions can be safely
ignored in the Heitler-London integrals as was done by Koiller et. al. [Phys.

coupling as a function of the voltage bias on control gates used to manipulate
the electron wavefunctions and implement quantum logic operations in the Kane

decrease the magnitude of the exchange coupling between neighbouring donor

the fluctuations are bounded. It is found out that the mathematical description
of the stochasity at both types of systems is identical. Then, it is to be
expected that it exhibits certain common features whose onset is the
stochasticity, namely: (i) The power spectrum of a time series of length $T$
comprises a strictly decreasing band that uniformly fits the shape
$1/f^\alpha(f)$ where $\alpha(1/T)=1$ and $\alpha(f)$ strictly increases to the
value $\alpha(\inf)=p$ ($p>2$) as $f$ approaches infinity. Practically, at low
frequencies this shape is $1/f$-like with high accuracy because the deviations
of the non-constant exponent $\alpha(f)$ from 1 are very small and become even
smaller as the frequency tends to 1/T. The greatest advantage of the shape
$1/\alpha(f)$ is that it ensures a finite variance of the fluctuations. (ii) It

quantum spin systems at rational values of the magnetization. In one dimension,
the appearance of a plateau is controlled by a quantization condition for the
magnetization which involves the length of the local spin and the volume of a
translational unit cell of the ground state. We discuss examples of
geometrically frustrated quantum spin systems with large (in general unbounded)
periodicities of spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in the ground
state.
  In two dimensions, we discuss the square, triangular and Kagome lattices
using exact diagonalization (ED) for up to N=40 sites. For the spin-1/2 XXZ
model on the triangular lattice we study the nature and stability region of a
plateau at one third of the saturation magnetization. The Kagome lattice gives
rise to particularly rich behaviour with several plateaus in the magnetization
curve and a jump due to local magnon excitations just below saturation.

cellular force patterns during active mechanosensing can be modelled as
anisotropic force contraction dipoles. Their build-up depends on the mechanical
properties of the environment, including elastic rigidity and prestrain. In a
finite sized sample, it also depends on sample geometry and boundary conditions
through image strain fields. We discuss the interactions of active cells with
an elastic environment and compare it to the case of physical force dipoles.
Despite marked differences, both cases can be described in the same theoretical

contraction dipoles in different geometries (full space, halfspace and sphere)

optimal position and orientation of mechanosensing cells in soft material.

searching: Given a subset S of size n from the universe [m], store S so that
queries of the form ""What is the predecessor of x in S?"" can be answered
efficiently. We study this problem in the cell probe model introduced by Yao.
Recently, Beame and Fich obtained optimal bounds on the number of probes needed
by any deterministic query scheme if the associated storage scheme uses only
n^{O(1)} cells of word size (\log m)^{O(1)} bits. We give a new lower bound
proof for this problem that matches the bounds of Beame and Fich. Our lower
bound proof has the following advantages: it works for randomised query schemes
too, while Beame and Fich's proof works for deterministic query schemes only.
It also extends to `quantum address-only' query schemes that we define in this
paper, and is simpler than Beame and Fich's proof. We prove our lower bound
using the round elimination approach of Miltersen, Nisan, Safra and Wigderson.
Using tools from information theory, we prove a strong round elimination lemma
for communication complexity that enables us to obtain a tight lower bound for
the predecessor problem. Our strong round elimination lemma also extends to
quantum communication complexity. We also use our round elimination lemma to
obtain a rounds versus communication tradeoff for the `greater-than' problem,
improving on the tradeoff in Miltersen et al. We believe that our round
elimination lemma is of independent interest and should have other
applications.

with high statistics using more than 100 gauge configurations. In particular,
about 1000 gauge configurations are used near the critical temperature T_c. The
chiral extrapolation is done from the lattice result with the current-quark
mass of m_q = 21,36,52 MeV. While the thermal effects on both of the mixed
condensate and the quark condensate are very weak except for the vicinity of
T_c, both the condensates suddenly vanish around T_c \simeq 280 MeV, which
indicates strong chiral restoration near T_c. To compare the thermal effects on
the two condensates, we analyze the ratio m_0^2 = g<\bar{q} \sigma G q>/

in the very vicinity of T_c. This means that these two different condensates
obey the same critical behavior, and this nontrivial similarity between them
would impose constraints on the chiral structure of the QCD vacuum near T_c.

with an extra gauge group G which becomes strong at the TeV scale. The strong
dynamics of G breaks the electroweak symmetry, giving the masses for the W and

traveling this distance the emission process can be disrupted. There are
different agents: multiple scattering of projectile, polarization of a medium,
action of external fields, etc. The theory of radiation under influence of the
multiple scattering, the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect, is presented.
The probability of radiation is calculated with an accuracy up to ""next to

integral characteristics of bremsstrahlung are given, it is shown that the
effective radiation length increases due to the LPM effect at high energy. The
LPM effect for pair creation is also presented. The multiple scattering
influences also on radiative corrections in a medium (and an external field
too) including the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron and the

field. The polarization of a medium alters the radiation probability in soft

a theory of connections at two levels, essentially given by 1- and 2-forms. So
far, there have been two approaches to this subject. The differential picture
uses non-Abelian 1- and 2-forms in order to generalize the connection 1-form of
a conventional gauge theory to the next level. The integral picture makes use
of curves and surfaces labeled with elements of non-Abelian groups and
generalizes the formulation of gauge theory in terms of parallel transports. We
recall how to circumvent the classic no-go theorems in order to define
non-Abelian surface ordered products in the integral picture. We then derive
the differential picture from the integral formulation under the assumption
that the curve and surface labels depend smoothly on the position of the curves
and surfaces. We show that some aspects of the no-go theorems are still present
in the differential (but not in the integral) picture. This implies a
substantial structural difference between non-perturbative and perturbative
approaches to higher gauge theory. We finally demonstrate that higher gauge
theory provides a geometrical explanation for the extended topological symmetry
of BF-theory in both pictures.

accelerated mirror in 1+1 space and the emission of single photons or scalar
quanta by electric or scalar charge in 3+1 space is deepened in this paper. The
relation of Bogoliubov coefficients with Fourier's components of current or
charge density leads to the coicidence of the spin of any disturbances bilinear
in scalar or spinor field with the spin of quanta emitted by the electric or
scalar charge. The mass and invariant momentum transfer of these disturbances
are essential for the relation of Bogoliubov coefficients with Green's
functions of wave equations both for 1+1 and 3+1 spaces. Namely the relation
(20) leads to the coincidence of the self-action changes and vacuum-vacuum
amplitudes for the accelerated mirror in 1+1 space and charge in 3+1 space.
Thus, both invariants of the Lorentz group, spin and mass, perform intrinsic
role in established symmetry. The symmetry embraces not only the processes of
real quanta radiation. It extends also to the processes of the mirror and the
charge interactions with the fields carring spacelike momenta. These fields
accompany their sources and define the Bogoliubov matrix coefficients
\alpha^{B,F}. It is shown that the traces of \alpha^{B,F} describe the vector
and scalar interactions of accelerated mirror with uniformly moving detector.
This interpretation rests essentially on the relation (100) between the
propagators of the waves with spacelike momenta in 2- and 4-dimentional spaces.
The traces of \alpha^{B,F} coincide actually with the products of the mass
shift \Delta m_{1,0} of accelerated electric or scalar charge and the proper
time of the shift formation. The symmetry fixes the value of the bare fine
structure constant \alpha_0=1/4\pi.

recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) on flow-aligned bundles. Bundles were made
of microtubules with either GMPCPP or GTP at the exchangeable site on the
tubulin dimer. Recovery times were sensitive to bundle thickness and packing,
indicating that taxol molecules are able to move laterally through the bundle.
The density of open binding sites along a microtubule was varied by controlling
the concentration of taxol in solution for GMPCPP samples. With > 63% sites
occupied, recovery times were independent of taxol concentration and,
therefore, inversely proportional to the microscopic dissociation rate,
k_{off}. It was found that 10*k_{off} (GMPCPP) ~ k_{off} (GTP), consistent
with, but not fully accounting for, the difference in equilibrium constants for
taxol on GMPCPP and GTP microtubules. With < 63% sites occupied, recovery times
decreased as ~ [Tax]^{-1/5} for both types of microtubules. We conclude that
the diffusion of taxol along the microtubule interior is hindered by rebinding
events when open sites are within ~7 nm of each other.

  gene expression","11 pages, 4 figures","BMC Bioinformatics 4:40 (2003)",,"LU TP 02-14","q-bio.QM",,"  Background: The availability of high throughput methods for measurement of
mRNA concentrations makes the reliability of conclusions drawn from the data
and global quality control of samples and hybridization important issues. We
address these issues by an information theoretic approach, applied to
discretized expression values in replicated gene expression data.
  Results: Our approach yields a quantitative measure of two important
parameter classes: First, the probability $P(\sigma | S)$ that a gene is in the
biological state $\sigma$ in a certain variety, given its observed expression
$S$ in the samples of that variety. Second, sample specific error probabilities
which serve as consistency indicators of the measured samples of each variety.
The method and its limitations are tested on gene expression data for
developing murine B-cells and a $t$-test is used as reference. On a set of
known genes it performs better than the $t$-test despite the crude
discretization into only two expression levels. The consistency indicators,
i.e. the error probabilities, correlate well with variations in the biological
material and thus prove efficient.
  Conclusions: The proposed method is effective in determining differential
gene expression and sample reliability in replicated microarray data. Already
at two discrete expression levels in each sample, it gives a good explanation
of the data and is comparable to standard techniques.

of a simplified four-state model, we investigate the passage from the domain of
conventional laser theory into the regime of strong coupling for a single
intracavity atom pumped by coherent external fields. The four-state model is
also employed to exhibit the vacuum-Rabi splitting and to calculate the optical
spectrum. We next extend this model to incorporate the relevant Zeeman
hyperfine states as well as a simple description of the pumping processes in
the presence of polarization gradients and atomic motion. This extended model
is employed to make quantitative comparisons with the measurements of Ref. [1]
for the intracavity photon number versus pump strength and for the photon
statistics as expressed by the intensity correlation function g2(tau).

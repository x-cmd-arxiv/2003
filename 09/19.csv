in a higher dimensional bulk, has the peculiar property that the inflationary
consistency relation derived in a four-dimensional cosmology persists. This
consistency condition relates the ratio of tensor and scalar perturbation
amplitudes to the tensor spectral index produced during an epoch of slow-roll
scalar field inflation. We attempt to clarify this surprising degeneracy. Our
argument involves calculating the power spectrum of scalar field fluctuations
around geometries perturbed away from the exact de Sitter case. This
calculation is expected to be valid for perturbations which would not cause a
late-time acceleration of the universe. We use these results to argue that the
emergence of the same consistency relation in the braneworld can be connected
with a specific property, that five-dimensional observables smoothly approach
their four-dimensional counterparts as one takes the brane to infinite tension.
We exhibit an explicit example where this does not occur, and in which a
consistency relation does not persist.

have important implications for many studies, including the survival of

ratios. We find that less than one in five of systems show a significant soft
X-ray excess, while the rest show ratios consistent with that predicted by the
standard model. We have investigated the discrepancy between this and the
previous investigations by re-examining all the available ROSAT PSPC pointed
observations of polars using more recent calibrations than in the original

consistent with that of our XMM-Newton results. We conclude that the previous

physical mechanisms might give rise to a high soft X-ray excess and whether
systems with high ratios show more variation in soft X-rays. Surprisingly, we
find that 6 out of 21 systems found in a high accretion state did not show a
distinct soft X-ray component. Two systems showed one pole with such a
component and one which did not. Based on the ratio of the observed soft X-ray
to UV flux measurements (which were obtained simultaneously using the Optical

conclude that the secondary is undermassive, overluminous, and expanded over a

the white dwarf coincides with that due to near-equilibrium angular momentum
loss by gravitational radiation and angular momentum transfer from the orbit

correspondingly higher accretion rate requires that either an additional

becoming supersolar in the center. The hosts of the rare bright quasars at
z~5-6 have star formation rates of several hundred solar masses per year and

bright, low luminosity Flat Radio Spectrum (LL FRS) sources. Our study focuses
on the properties of their host galaxies, namely the nuclear stellar
populations and dust content. In the optical, the objects in the sample are
mainly dominated by the host galaxy starlight, which strongly dilutes the
non-thermal continuum as well as possible emission-line features related to the
active nucleus. We have computed the nuclear stellar populations contributing
to the spectra of our objects. The stellar population synthesis has been
performed by using a very reliable mathematical method, which yields a Global
Principal Geometrical solution. Our results show that, for most of the objects
in the sample, the populations are composed of old stars of solar metallicity,
or lower; the populations are mainly composed of late-type stars, i.e. G, K and
M spectral types, the young component coming thus from supergiant stars; the
dust content is weak. Both the stellar populations and the dust content are in
agreement with what is usually observed in ""normal"" elliptical galaxies.
Similar stellar content has equally been found in the nuclear regions of
galaxies hosting a Low Ionization Nuclear Emission Line Region, or LINER. The
present work is important in illustrating the different applications of stellar
population synthesis in the study of low luminosity radio sources. In fact, the
synthesis allows us not only to obtain valuable information about the stellar
populations and dust content of the host galaxies, therefore providing material
for further studies on the connection between host galaxy and active nucleus,
but also to reveal the so-far unstudied optical emission-line features present
in the spectrum of our objects.

by means of magnetization measurements up to 14 T. Our results clearly show
that in the antiferromagnetic phase Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM)superexchange
causes Cu spin canting not only in the LTO phase but also in the LTLO and LTT
phases. In La1.8Eu0.2CuO4 the canted DM-moment is about 50% larger than in pure
La2CuO4 which we attribute to the larger octahedral tilt angle. We also find
clear evidence that the size of the DM-moment does not change significantly at
the structural transition at T_LT from LTO to LTLO and LTT. The most important
change induced by the transition is a significant reduction of the magnetic
coupling between the CuO2 planes. As a consequence, the spin-flip transition of
the canted Cu spins which is observed in the LTO phase for magnetic field
perpendicular to the CuO2 planes disappears in the LTT phase. The shape of the
magnetization curves changes from the well known spin-flip type to a
weak-ferromagnet type. However, no spontaneous weak ferromagnetism is observed
even at very low temperatures, which seems to indicate that the interlayer
decoupling in our samples is not perfect. Nonetheless, a small fraction (<15%)
of the DM-moments can be remanently magnetized throughout the entire
antiferromagnetically ordered LTT/LTLO phase, i.e. for T<T_LT and x<0.02. It
appears that the remanent DM-moment is perpendicular to the CuO2 planes. For
magnetic field parallel to the CuO2 planes we find that the critical field of
the spin-flop transition decreases in the LTLO phase, which might indicate a
competition between different in-plane anisotropies. To study the Cu spin
magnetism in La2-x-yEuySrxCuO4, a careful analysis of the Van Vleck

leads to much stronger predictions than standard Newtonian theory. For the
dynamics of Riemannian 3-geometries on which matter fields also evolve,
implementation of the new relativity principle establishes unexpected links
between special relativity, general relativity and the gauge principle. They
all emerge together as a self-consistent complex from a unified and completely
relational approach to dynamics. A connection between time and scale invariance

supersymmetric SU(N_c) gauge theories with N_f flavors of quarks in the
presence of a baryon chemical potential mu, and describe the global symmetry
breaking patterns at low energy. Our analysis requires mu < Lambda and is thus
complementary to the variational approach that has been successful for mu <<

analogous to the non-supersymmetric 2SC phase, whereas for N_f=N_c there is a
critical chemical potential above which the U(1)_B is broken, as it is in the
non-supersymmetric CFL phase. We further analyze the cases with N_c+1 <= N_f <
3/2 N_c and find that baryon number is broken dynamically for mu > mu_c. We
also give a qualitative description of the phases in the `conformal window',

fluxes of gauge fields within the D7-branes, which induce a D-term potential in
the effective 4D action. In this way we obtain dS space as a spontaneously
broken vacuum from a purely supersymmetric 4D action. We argue that our

generated by anomalous U(1) gauge groups.

  As is well known, for $\la=1/2$ the invariant set, $\S_\la$, is a fractal
called the Sierpi\'nski sieve, and for $\la<1/2$ it is also a fractal. Our goal
is to study $\S_\la$ for this IFS for $1/2<\la<2/3$, i.e., when there are
""overlaps"" in $\S_\la$ as well as ""holes"". In this introductory paper we show
that despite the overlaps (i.e., the Open Set Condition breaking down
completely), the attractor can still be a totally self-similar fractal,
although this happens only for a very special family of algebraic $\la$'s
(so-called ""multinacci numbers""). We evaluate $\dim_H(\S_\la)$ for these
special values by showing that $\S_\la$ is essentially the attractor for an
infinite IFS which does satisfy the Open Set Condition. We also show that the
set of points in the attractor with a unique ``address'' is self-similar, and
compute its dimension.
  For ``non-multinacci'' values of $\la$ we show that if $\la$ is close to 2/3,
then $\S_\la$ has a nonempty interior and that if $\la<1/\sqrt{3}$ then \S_\la$
has zero Lebesgue measure. Finally we discuss higher-dimensional analogues of
the model in question.

stratification of $F$ which is the analogue of the Shatz stratification for
holomorphic vector bundles. In the last chapter we show that our results can be
generalized to the gauge theoretical framework: first we show that the system
of semistable quotients associated with the classical Harder-Narasimhan
filtration of a non-semistable bundle $\EE$ can be recovered as the limit
object in the direction given by the optimal destabilizing vector of $\EE$.
Second, we extend this principle to holomorphic pairs: we give the analogue of
the Harder-Narasimhan theorem for this moduli problem and we discuss the
relation between the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of a non-semistable
holomorphic pair and its optimal destabilizing vector.

components involved are diffusion-free. This peculiar phenomenon is
demonstrated for a paradigmatic three-component reaction-diffusion model. The
origin of this anomalous spiral dynamics is the effective non-locality in
coupling, whose effect is stronger for weaker coupling. There exists a critical
coupling strength which is estimated from a simple argument. Detailed
mathematical and numerical analyses are carried out in the extreme case of weak
coupling for which the phase reduction method is applicable. Under the
assumption that the mean field pattern keeps to rotate steadily as a result of
a statistical cancellation of the incoherence, we derive a functional
self-consistency equation to be satisfied by this space-time dependent
quantity. Its solution and the resulting effective frequencies of the
individual oscillators are found to agree excellently with the numerical

parameters. Its relation to other dynamical mechanisms, the induced fission and
the abrasion of the spectator zones, that can also contribute to mid-rapidity
$IMF$ production, is discussed. The dependence on beam energy and centrality of
the collision is carefully analysed. The competition between volume and surface
instabilities makes this mechanism very sensitive to the in-medium
nucleon-nucleon interactions, from the cross sections for hard collisions to
the compressibility and other Equation of State ($EOS$) properties.

the symmetry energy is investigated. Of particular interest appears the isospin
diffusion dynamics with no signal of isospin equilibration. However, in spite
of the short time scales and of the dynamical aspects, we notice isoscaling

to the area enclosed by the split components of the atom. However, this model
is unclear for an atomic interferometer demonstrated recently by Shahriar et
al., for which the atom simply passes through a single-zone optical beam,
consisting of a pair of bichromatic counter-propagating beams. During the
passage, the atomic wave packets in two distinct internal states couple to each
other continuously. The two internal states trace out a complicated trajectory,
guided by the optical beams, with the amplitude and spread of each wavepacket
varying continuously. Yet, at the end of the single-zone excitation, there is
an interference with fringe amplitudes that can reach a visibility close to
unity. For such a situation, it is not clear how one would define the area of
the interferometer, and therefore, what the rotation sensitivity of such an
interferometer would be. In this paper we analyze this interferometer in order
to determine its rotation sensitivity, and thereby determine its effective
area. In many ways, the continuous interferometer (CI) can be thought of as a
limiting version of the Borde-Chu Interferometer (BCI). We identify a quality
factor that can be used to compare the performance of these interferometers.
Under conditions of practical interest, we show that the rotation sensitivity
of the CI can be comparable to that of the BCI. The relative simplicity of the
CI (e.g., elimination of the task of precise angular alignment of the three
zones) then makes it a potentially better candidate for practical atom
interferometry for rotation sensing.

with different evolution paths proposed in [E. Farhi, et al.,
arXiv:quant-ph/0208135]. The algorithm is applied to a random binary
optimization problem (a version of the 3-Satisfiability problem) where the
n-bit cost function is symmetric with respect to the permutation of individual
bits. The evolution paths are produced, using the generic control Hamiltonians
H(\tau) that preserve the bit symmetry of the underlying optimization problem.
In the case where the ground state of H(0) coincides with the totally-symmetric
state of an n-qubit system the algorithm dynamics is completely described in
terms of the motion of a spin-n/2.
  We show that different control Hamiltonians can be parameterized by a set of
independent parameters that are expansion coefficients of H(\tau) in a certain
universal set of operators. Only one of these operators can be responsible for
avoiding the tunnelling in the spin-n/2 system during the quantum adiabatic
algorithm. We show that it is possible to select a coefficient for this
operator that guarantees a polynomial complexity of the algorithm for all
problem instances. We show that a successful evolution path of the algorithm
always corresponds to the trajectory of a classical spin-n/2 and provide a
complete characterization of such paths.

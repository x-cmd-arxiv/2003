using a previously presented scaling relationship, derived from reverberation
mapping of nearby quasars, and compared to quasars at lower redshift. It is
shown that the central black holes in luminous z >~ 4 quasars are very massive
(>~ 10^9 solar masses). It is argued that the mass estimates of the high-z
quasars are not subject to larger uncertainties than those for nearby quasars.
Specifically, the large masses are not overestimates and the lack of similarly
large black-hole masses in the nearby Universe does not rule out their
existence at high-z. However, AGN host galaxies do not typically appear fully
formed or evolved at these early epochs. This supports scenarios in which black
holes build up mass very fast in a radiatively inefficient (or obscured) phase
relative to the stars in their galaxies. Additionally, upper envelopes of
black-hole mass of approximately 10^{10} solar masses and bolometric luminosity
of ~ 10^{48} erg/s are observed at all redshifts.

single-lined chromospherically active binaries from a differential LTE analysis
of high-resolution spectra. Abundances have been derived for 13 chemical
species, including several key elements such as Li, Mg, and Ca. Two methods
have been used. The effective temperatures, surface gravities and
microturbulent velocities were first derived from a fully self-consistent
analysis of the spectra, whereby the temperature is determined from the
excitation equilibrium of the Fe I lines. The second approach relies on
temperatures derived from the (B-V) colour index. These two methods give
broadly consistent results for the stars in our sample, suggesting that the
neutral iron lines are formed under conditions close to LTE. We discuss the
reliability in the context of chromospherically active stars of various colour
indices used as temperature indicators, and conclude that the (V-R) and (V-I)
colours are likely to be significantly affected by activity processes.
Irrespective of the method used, our results indicate that the X-ray active
binaries studied are not as metal poor as previously claimed, but are at most
mildly iron-depleted relative to the Sun (-0.41<[Fe/H]<+0.11). A significant
overabundance of several chemical species is observed (e.g., the
alpha-synthezised elements). These abundance patterns are discussed in relation
to stellar activity.

influence the evolution of their parent evolved stars. As sun-like stars evolve
on the red giant branch (RGB) and then on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB),
they will interact with their close planets (if exist). The interaction starts
with tidal interaction: this will lead the planets to deposit most of their
angular momentum to the envelope of the giant, and then spiral-in to the
envelope. (Too many papers dealing with close planets [less than about 3-6 AU]
around evolved stars neglect tidal interaction, hence their results are
questionable.) They may spin-up their parent stars by up to several orders of
magnitude. The interaction of substellar objects with evolved star may enhance
the mass loss rate, mainly in the equatorial plane. Possible outcomes are: (i)
Planetary systems interacting with their parent AGB star may lead to the
formation of moderate elliptical planetary nebulae. (ii) RGB stars which lose
more mass turn to bluer horizontal branch (HB) stars. Therefore, planets may
explain the formation of blue HB stars. This may explain the presence of many
blue HB stars in many globular clusters (the planets be the second parameter),
and some hot HB stars in the galaxy (sdB stars). (The 8.3 days use of the
Hubble Space Telescope in search of planets in a globular clusters with no blue
HB stars was a wrong move.) (iii) Most known stars with planets will not form
planetary nebulae, because they will lose most of their envelope already on the
RGB.

of rotating stars for a range of stellar progenitors. We find that for the
fastest spinning stars, rotation does indeed modify the convection above the
proto-neutron star, but it is not fast enough to cause core fragmentation.
Similarly, although strong magnetic fields can be produced once the
proto-neutron star cools and contracts, the proto-neutron star is not spinning
fast enough to generate strong magnetic fields quickly after collapse and, for
our simulations, magnetic fields will not dominate the supernova explosion
mechanism. Even so, the resulting pulsars for our fastest rotating models may
emit enough energy to dominate the total explosion energy of the supernova.
However, more recent stellar models predict rotation rates that are much too
slow to affect the explosion, but these models are not sophisticated enough to
determine whether the most recent, or past, stellar rotation rates are most
likely. Thus, we must rely upon observational constraints to determine the true
rotation rates of stellar cores just before collapse. We conclude with a
discussion of the possible constraints on stellar rotation which we can derive
from core-collapse supernovae.

These data, 80% complete to V and I magnitudes of 26.0 and 25.3, respectively,

of the red giant branch (TRGB) distance modulus of 27.95+/-0.07, corresponding
to a distance of 3.89+/-0.22 Mpc, and a location on the far side of the
Sculptor Group. NGC 625 has a well-defined radial stellar population gradient,
evidenced by a central concentration of young MS stars and an RGB/AGB ratio
that increases with galactocentric distance. The prominent AGB is very red, and
RGB stars are detected far from the central star forming regions. Using H Alpha
and H Beta narrow band imaging and previous optical spectroscopy we identify
substantial and varying internal extinction (A_V = 0.0 to 0.6 mag) associated
with the central active star formation regions. To better understand the
effects of internal extinction on the analysis of young stellar populations,
synthetic models are presented which, for the first time, examine and account
for this effect. Using the luminous blue helium burning stars, we construct a
simple model of the recent (< 100 Myr) star formation in which an elevated but
declining star formation rate has been present over this entire period. This is
at odds with the presence of spectroscopic W-R features in the major star
formation region which imply a short duration (<= 5 Myr) for the recent
starburst. This suggests that starbursts displaying W-R features are not
necessarily all of a short duration. Finally, we speculate on the possible
causes of the present burst of star formation in this apparently isolated
galaxy, and compare it to other nearby, well-studied dwarf starburst systems.

values kT = 6.0(+0.7,-0.5) keV, Z = 0.36(+0.12,-0.10) Z_sun. In the likely

light curves at each epoch that were then analyzed for the presence of the

all four epochs, but the 28 s periodicity is absent. The origin of these
oscillations has been debated since their discovery in the 1970s and competing
hypotheses are based on either white dwarf non-radial g-mode pulsations or
magnetically-channelled accretion onto a rotating white dwarf. By analogy with
the ZZ Ceti stars, we argue that the non-radial g-mode pulsation model demands
a strong dependence of pulse period on the white dwarf's temperature. However,
these observations show the 29 s oscillation is independent of the white
dwarf's temperature. Thus we reject the white dwarf non-radial g-mode pulsation
hypothesis as the sole origin of the oscillations. It remains unclear if
magnetically-funnelled accretion onto a rapidly rotating white dwarf (or belt
on the white dwarf) is responsible for producing the oscillations. We also

evolution of the stress is studied as a function of wall movement both in the
direction of gravity as well as opposite to it. For all wall velocities
explored, the stress in the final state of the system after wall movement is
fundamentally different from the original state obtained by pouring particles
into the container and letting them settle under the influence of gravity. The
original packing possesses a hydrostatic-like region at the top of the
container which crosses over to a depth-independent stress. As the walls are
moved in the direction opposite to gravity, the saturation stress first reaches
a minimum value independent of the wall velocity, then increases to a
steady-state value dependent on the wall-velocity. After wall movement ceases
and the packing reaches equilibrium, the stress profile fits the classic
Janssen form for high wall velocities, while it has some deviations for low
wall velocities. The wall movement greatly increases the number of
particle-wall and particle-particle forces at the Coulomb criterion. Varying
the wall velocity has only small effects on the particle structure of the final

hodographic coordinates. This is done by using the method of solving the
Born-Infeld equations by Whitham. We directly compute conformal coordinates on
the minimal surface which give the Weierstrass-Enneper representation. From
this we derive the hodographic coordinate $\rho \in D \subset {\CC}$ and
$\sigma $ its complex conjugate which enables us to write the
Weierstrass-Enneper representation in a new way.

problem yet to be considered, that is, the problem of characterizing the
B\""acklund transformations in terms of Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. In this
direction, we show that the B\""acklund transformations are just the pull-back
of very simple transformations on the moduli of monodromy representations by
the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. This result gives a natural and clear
picture of the B\""acklund transformations. Key words: B\""acklund

of stable parabolic connection on $\BP^1$ with logarithmic poles at $D(\bt) =
t_1 + ... + t_n$ as well as its natural compactification. Moreover the moduli
space $\cR(\cP_{n, \bt})_{\ba}$ of Jordan equivalence classes of
$SL_2(\C)$-representations of the fundamental group $\pi_1(\BP^1 \setminus

Riemann-Hilbert correspondence $\RH: M_n^{\balpha}(\bt, \blambda, L) \lra
\cR(\cP_{n, \bt})_{\ba}$ and prove that $\RH$ is a bimeromorphic proper
surjective analytic map. Painlev\'e and Garnier equations can be derived from
the isomonodromic flows and Painlev\'e property of these equations are easily
derived from the properties of $\RH$. We also prove that the smooth parts of
both moduli spaces have natural symplectic structures and $\RH$ is a symplectic
resolution of singularities of $\cR(\cP_{n, \bt})_{\ba}$, from which one can
give geometric backgrounds for other interesting phenomena, like Hamiltonian

E, in press",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.68.056603",,"nlin.PS nlin.SI",,"  We examine collisions between identical solitons in a weakly perturbed
Ablowitz-Ladik (AL) model, augmented by either onsite cubic nonlinearity (which
corresponds to the Salerno model, and may be realized as an array of strongly
overlapping nonlinear optical waveguides), or a quintic perturbation, or both.
Complex dependences of the outcomes of the collisions on the initial phase
difference between the solitons and location of the collision point are
observed. Large changes of amplitudes and velocities of the colliding solitons
are generated by weak perturbations, showing that the elasticity of soliton
collisions in the AL model is fragile (for instance, the Salerno's perturbation
with the relative strength of 0.08 can give rise to a change of the solitons'
amplitudes by a factor exceeding 2). Exact and approximate conservation laws in
the perturbed system are examined, with a conclusion that the small
perturbations very weakly affect the norm and energy conservation, but
completely destroy the conservation of the lattice momentum, which is explained
by the absence of the translational symmetry in generic nonintegrable lattice
models. Data collected for a very large number of collisions correlate with
this conclusion. Asymmetry of the collisions (which is explained by the
dependence on the location of the central point of the collision relative to
the lattice, and on the phase difference between the solitons) is investigated
too, showing that the nonintegrability-induced effects grow almost linearly
with the perturbation strength. Different perturbations (cubic and quintic
ones) produce virtually identical collision-induced effects, which makes it
possible to compensate them, thus finding a special perturbed system with
almost elastic soliton collisions.

is the same as the conjugated gradient (CG) method, i.e, minimizing the
Rayleigh quotient via its gradient and avoiding reintroduce errors to the
directions of previous gradients. Each iteration step is to find lowest
eigenvector of the matrix in a subspace spanned by the current trial vector and
the corresponding gradient of the Rayleigh quotient, as well as some previous
trial vectors. The gradient, together with the previous trail vectors, play a
similar role of the conjugated gradient of the original CG algorithm. Our
numeric tests indicate that this method converges significantly faster than the
original CG method. And the computational cost of one iteration step is about
the same as the original CG method. It is suitably for first principle
calculations.

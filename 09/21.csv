merging with the host system. On this basis we determine in this paper the
bolometric, optical and X-ray luminosity functions for the accreting MBHs using

proposed LISA gravitational wave observatory. The collapse of the first massive
stars to form MBHs may be accompanied by gamma ray bursts (GRBs). If this is
the case and GRBs are in principle observable out to the redshifts of first
star formation, we find that about 10^5 - 10^6 GRBs per year could be detected.
As merging MBH binaries reach their last stable orbits before final coalescence
a fraction of the gravitational wave energy may be released as a pulse of gamma
rays (for instance, through interaction with material enveloping a merging MBH
binary). This fraction has to be in the range between 10^{-14} - 10^{-10} for
MBH mergers to be less luminous than GBRs, yet detectable out to cosmological

that the distribution function of a {\it frictionless} inelastic hard sphere

``BKS'' model [Van Beest, Kramer and van Santen, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 64},
1955 (1990)], have demonstrated that the liquid undergoes a dynamical crossover
from super-Arrhenius, or ``fragile'' behavior, to Arrhenius, or ``strong''
behavior, as temperature $T$ is decreased. From extensive MD simulations, we
show that this fragile-to-strong crossover (FSC) can be connected to changes in
the properties of the potential energy landscape, or surface (PES), of the
liquid. To achieve this, we use thermodynamic integration to evaluate the
absolute free energy of the liquid over a wide range of density and $T$. We use
this free energy data, along with the concept of ``inherent structures'' of the
PES, to evaluate the absolute configurational entropy $S_c$ of the liquid. We
find that the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient and of $S_c$
are consistent with the prediction of Adam and Gibbs, including in the region
where we observe the FSC to occur. We find that the FSC is related to a change
in the properties of the PES explored by the liquid, specifically an inflection
in the $T$ dependence of the average inherent structure energy. In addition, we
find that the high $T$ behavior of $S_c$ suggests that the liquid entropy might
approach zero at finite $T$, behavior associated with the so-called Kauzmann
paradox. However, we find that the change in the PES that underlies the FSC is
associated with a change in the $T$ dependence of $S_c$ that elucidates how the
Kauzmann paradox is avoided in this system. Finally, we also explore the
relation of the observed PES changes to the recently discussed possibility that
BKS silica exhibits a liquid-liquid phase transition, a behavior that has been
proposed to underlie the observed polyamorphism of amorphous solid silica.

shocks or aftershocks emerges automatically without imposing predefined
space-time windows. To construct a network, each earthquake receives an
incoming link from its most correlated predecessor. The number of aftershocks
for any event, identified by its outgoing links, is found to be scale free with
exponent $\gamma = 2.0(1)$. The original Omori law with $p=1$ emerges as a
robust feature of seismicity, holding up to years even for aftershock sequences
initiated by intermediate magnitude events. The measured fat-tailed

symmetric. For sufficiently small curvatures the resulting field equations can
be divided into two sets. One set, involving the antisymmetric part of the
Ricci tensor $R_{\stackrel{\mu\nu}{\vee}}$, consists of the field equation for
a massive vector field. The other set consists of the Einstein field equations
with an energy momentum tensor for the vector field plus additional
corrections. In a vacuum with $R_{\stackrel{\mu\nu}{\vee}}=0$ the field
equations are shown to be the usual Einstein vacuum equations. This extends the
universality of the vacuum Einstein equations, discussed by Ferraris et al.
\cite{Fe1,Fe2}, to the Born-Infeld-Einstein action. In the simplest version of
the theory there is a single coupling constant and by requiring that the
Einstein field equations hold to a good approximation in neutron stars it is
shown that mass of the vector field exceeds the lower bound on the mass of the
photon. Thus, in this case the vector field cannot represent the
electromagnetic field and would describe a new geometrical field. In a more
general version in which the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the Ricci
tensor have different coupling constants it is possible to satisfy all of the
observational constraints if the antisymmetric coupling is much larger than the

calculation of the self-force phenomenon. In this approach, one considers a
charged extended object of a finite size $\epsilon$ that accelerates in a
nontrivial manner, and calculates the total force exerted on it by the
electromagnetic field (whose source is the charged object itself). We show that
at the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ this overall electromagnetic field yields a
universal result, independent on the object's shape, which agrees with the
standard expression for the self force acting on a point-like charge. This
approach has already been considered by many authors, but previous analyses
ended up with expressions for the total electromagnetic force that include
$O(1/\epsilon)$ terms which do not have the form required by
mass-renormalization. (In the special case of a spherical charge distribution,
this $\propto 1/\epsilon $ term was found to be 4/3 times larger than the
desired quantity.) We show here that this problem was originated from a too
naive definition of the notion of ''total electromagnetic force'' used in
previous analyses. Based on energy-momentum conservation combined with proper
relativistic kinematics, we derive here the correct notion of total
electromagnetic force. This completely cures the problematic $O(1/\epsilon)$
term, for any object's shape, and yields the correct self force at the limit
$\epsilon \to 0$. In particular, for a spherical charge distribution, the above
''4/3 problem'' is resolved.

more on the K+N (I=0) elastic cross section and on the P01 phase shift is
examined within the KN meson-exchange model of the Juelich group. It is shown
that the rather strong enhancement of the cross section caused by the presence
of a Z^+ with the above properties is not compatible with the existing
empirical information on KN scattering. Only a much narrower Z^+ state could be
reconciled with the existing data -- or, alternatively, the Z^+ state must lie
at an energy much closer to the KN threshold.

The definition of these invariants is obtained from the definition of L^2
homology for groups, using the ideas from the theory of correspondences. For
the group algebra of a discrete group, our Betti numbers coincide with the L^2
Betti numbers of the group. We find a link between the first L^2 Betti number
and free entropy dimension, which points to the non-vanishing of L^2 homology
for the von Neumann algebra of a free group.

$w$ in a group $G$ with finite generating set $X$ is a dead end element if no
geodesic ray from the identity to $w$ in the Cayley graph $\Gamma(G,X)$ can be
extended past $w$. Additionally, we describe some nonconvex behavior of paths
between elements in these Cayley graphs and seesaw words, which are potential
obstructions to these graphs satisfying the $k$-fellow traveller property.

flows and flows of their planar duals. It also yields an appealing proof that
every bridgeless triangulated graph has a nowhere-zero four-flow.

are studied within the framework of the hard rescattering mechanism~(HRM). In
HRM, a quark of one nucleon knocked-out by the incoming photon rescatters with
a quark of the other nucleon leading to the production of two nucleons with
high relative momentum. Summation of all relevant quark rescattering amplitudes
allows us to express the scattering amplitude of the reaction through the
convolution of a hard photon-quark interaction vertex, the large angle p-n
scattering amplitude and the low momentum deuteron wave function. Within HRM,
it is demonstrated that the polarization observables in hard
photodisintegration of the deuteron can be expressed through the five helicity
amplitudes of NN scattering at high momentum transfer. At 90$^\circ$ CM
scattering HRM predicts the dominance of the isovector channel of hard $pn$
rescattering, and it explains the observed smallness of induced, $P_y$ and
transfered, $C_x$ polarizations without invoking the argument of helicity
conservation. Namely, HRM predicts that $P_y$ and $C_x$ are proportional to the
$\phi_5$ helicity amplitude which vanishes at $\theta_{cm}=90^\circ$ due to
symmetry reasons. HRM predicts also a nonzero value for $C_z$ in the
helicity-conserving regime and a positive $\Sigma$ asymmetry which is related
to the dominance of the isovector channel in the hard reinteraction. We extend
our calculations to the region where large polarization effects are observed in
$pp$ scattering as well as give predictions for angular dependences.

formula, one which works when the emission period is small enough that it can
be considered that two successive signals are emitted from the same point in
space (locality assumption) and another which takes into account that two
successive signals are emitted from two different points in space (non-locality
assumption). The results furnished by the two Doppler shift formulas are
compared, showing that increasing the emission frequency decreases the
difference between the results obtained with the two formulas.

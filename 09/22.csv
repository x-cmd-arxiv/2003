richness-dependence from z = 0 to z = 3 using large-scale cosmological
simulations. A standard flat LCDM model with \Omega_m = 0.3 and, for
comparison, a tilted \Omega_m = 1 model, TSCDM, are used. The evolutionary
predictions are presented in a format suitable for direct comparisons with
observations. We find that the cluster correlation strength increases with
redshift: high redshift clusters are clustered more strongly (in comoving
scale) than low redshift clusters of the same mass. The increased correlations
with redshift, in spite of the decreasing mass correlation strength, is caused
by the strong increase in cluster bias with redshift: clusters represent higher
density peaks of the mass distribution as the redshift increases. The
richness-dependent cluster correlation function, presented as the
correlation-scale versus cluster mean separation relation, R_0 - d, is found to
be, remarkably, independent of redshift to z <~ 2 for LCDM and z <~ 1 for TCDM
(for a fixed correlation function slope and cluster mass within a fixed
comoving radius). The non-evolving R_0 - d relation implies that both the
comoving clustering scale and the cluster mean separation increase with
redshift for the same mass clusters so that the R_0 - d relation remains
essentially unchanged. The evolution of the R_0 - d relation from z ~ 0 to z ~
3 provides an important new tool in cosmology; it can be used to break
degeneracies that exist at z ~ 0 and provide precise determination of
cosmological parameters.

2003dh resemble those of SN 1998bw around maximum, but later they look more
like those of the less energetic hypernova SN 1997ef. The spectra and the
inferred light curve can be modeled adopting a density distribution similar to
that used for SN 1998bw at $ v > 25,000$\kms but more like that of SN 1997ef at
lower velocities. The mass of the ejecta is $\sim 8\Msun$, somewhat less than

later, as monitored by the ASM onboard RossiXTE, when it was also detected to
flare in the TeV band. Our X-ray spectra are well represented by a continuosly

0.1-0.7 keV. We compare our data with non simultaneous radio to TeV data and

by self-gravity. We have computed the gravitational stress tensor and compared
our results with expectations based on a local theory of transport. We find
that, for disc masses smaller than $0.25M_{\star}$ and aspect ratio

detected up to 20 keV, shows a double peak with the main component much
stronger than the other. The peak phase separation is 0.526 +/- 0.002 and the
pulsed spectrum over the energy range 2--25 keV is well described by a power
law with a photon index equal to 1.14 +/- 0.07. We find that the X-ray pulses
are closely aligned in phase with the giant pulses observed in the radio band.
This results suggest that giant radio pulses and X-ray pulses originate in the

that occasionally emits coherently in the radio band. The X-ray events,
however, do not show any clustering in time indicating that no X-ray flares are

useful in providing information about stellar atmospheres, the dynamics of

comprehensive guide for modelling and interpreting the lightcurves obtained in

avoids numerical difficulties and minimizes correlations between model

gasdynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. Temperature decreases by a factor
2-3 from the center to virial radius. Therefore, isothermal models (e.g.
$\beta$ model) give a very poor fit to simulated data. Moreover, gas entropy
profiles deviate from a power law near the center, which is also in very good

confirm that gas in clusters has an extended isothermal core, then
non-adiabatic physics would be required in order to explain it.

structure of a massive star and its consequences for the subsequent supernova
explosion. Interactions with a companion star may change the final rate of
rotation, the size of the helium core, the strength of carbon burning and the
final iron core mass. Stars with initial masses larger than \sim 11\Ms that
experiece core collapse will generally have smaller iron cores at the time of
the explosion if they lost their envelopes due to a previous binary
interaction. Stars below \sim 11\Ms, on the other hand, can end up with larger
helium and metal cores if they have a close companion, since the second
dredge-up phase which reduces the helium core mass dramatically in single stars
does not occur once the hydrogen envelope is lost. We find that the initially
more massive stars in binary systems with masses in the range 8 - 11\Ms are
likely to undergo an electron-capture supernova, while single stars in the same
mass range would end as ONeMg white dwarfs. We suggest that the core collapse
in an electron-capture supernova (and possibly in the case of relatively small
iron cores) leads to a prompt explosion rather than a delayed neutrino-driven
explosion and that this naturally produces neutron stars with low-velocity
kicks. This leads to a dichotomous distribution of neutron star kicks, as
inferred previously, where neutron stars in relatively close binaries attain
low kick velocities. We illustrate the consequences of such a dichotomous kick
scenario using binary population synthesis simulations and discuss its
implications. This scenario has also important consequences for the minimum
initial mass of a massive star that becomes a neutron star. (Abbreviated.)

optimized, we optimize all linear parameters of the potential. The method
exploits the high efficiency of the conformal space annealing method in finding
distinct low energy conformations. For a given training set of proteins, the
parameters are modified to make the native-like conformations energetically
more favorable than the non-native ones. Linear approximation is used to
estimate the energy change due to the parameter modification. The parameter
change is followed by local energy reminimization and new conformational
searches to find the energies of native-like and non-native local minima of the
energy function with new parameters. These steps are repeated until the
potential predicts a native-like conformation as one of the low energy
conformations for each protein in the training set. We consider a training set
of crambin (PDB ID 1ejg), 1fsd, and the 10-55 residue fragment of
staphylococcal protein A (PDB ID 1bdd). As the first check for the feasibility
of our protocol, we optimize the parameters separately for these proteins and
find an optimal set of parameters for each of them. Next we apply the method
simultaneously to these three proteins. By refining all linear parameters, we
obtain an optimal set of parameters from which the native-like conformations of
the all three proteins are retrieved as the global minima, without introducing

the algorithms for the identification of the community structure become fully

of arbitrary memory objects from a memory dump. Our motivating application is
debugging memory corruption problems in optimized, production systems -- a
problem domain largely unserved by extant methodologies. We describe our
algorithm as applicable to any typed language, and we discuss it with respect
to the formidable obstacles posed by C. We describe the heuristics that we have
developed to overcome these difficulties and achieve effective type
identification on C-based systems. We further describe the implementation of
our heuristics on one C-based system -- the Solaris operating system kernel --
and describe the extensions that we have added to the Solaris postmortem
debugger to allow for postmortem type identification. We show that our
implementation yields a sufficiently high rate of type identification to be
useful for debugging memory corruption problems. Finally, we discuss some of
the novel automated debugging mechanisms that can be layered upon postmortem
type identification.

slightly better. It is limited mainly by the fact that, due to the unavoidable
orbital injection errors, it would not be possible to insert the satellites in

only with a finite precision. The present-day level of accuracy, obtained with

the topological susceptibility does not require any renormalization, when using

topological susceptibility while keeping the systematic errors under
theoretical control. We present results for the SU(3) pure gauge theory using
the index of the overlap Dirac operator to study the topology of the gauge

overlap and using a new algorithm for the spectral flow analysis. A detailed
comparison with cooling techniques is presented. Particular care is taken in
assessing the systematic errors. Relatively high statistics (500 to 1000

perturbation theory allows to study reactions of pions and kaons and to further

progress on the description of pion-kaon scattering, in particular concerning
isospin violation and the extraction of threshold and resonance parameters from

mixing matrix, which takes advantage of the fact that there are up to three
small quantities in neutrino mixing phenomenology: (i) the deviation from
maximal mixing of solar neutrinos, (ii) the mixing matrix element U_{e3} and
(iii) the deviation from maximal mixing of atmospheric neutrinos. It is
possible to quantify those three observations with a parameter \lambda \sim
0.2, which appears at least linearly in all elements of the mixing matrix. The
limit \lambda -> 0 corresponds to exact bimaximal mixing. Present and future
experiments can be used to pin down the power of \lambda required to usefully
describe the observed phenomenology. Observing that the ratio of the two
measured mass squared differences is roughly \lambda^2 allows to further study
the structure of the Majorana mass matrix. We comment on the implications of
this parametrization for neutrinoless double beta decay and on the oscillation
probabilities in long-baseline experiments.

develops naturally if we include not only ordinary modules, but also weak
modules with a composition series of finite length (we call it an Artin
module). In particular, we don't assume the semisimplicity of the weight
operator L(0). Actually, without the assumption of rationality, a
C_2-cofiniteness on V is enough to obtain the existence of a tensor product of
two Artin modules and natural associativity of tensor products. Namely, the
category of Artin modules becomes a braided tensor category.
  As an application of the tensor product theory under C_2-cofiniteness, we
proved the rationality of some orbifold models. For example, if a vertex
operator algebra V has a finite automorphism group and the fixed point vertex
operator subalgebra V^G is C_2-cofinite, then for any irreducible
V^{<g>}-module W, there is an element h\in <g> such that W is contained in some

\cite{Kl2}. From this deformation we further obtain an explicit, probability
preserving and isometric isomorphism between the Banach algebra of bounded
$SU(d)$-biinvariant measures on $SL(d,\comp)$ and a certain (non-invariant)
subalgebra of the bounded signed measures on $H_d^0$. We demonstrate how this
probability preserving isomorphism leads to limit theorems for the singular

Our construction relies on deformations of hypergroup convolutions and will be
carried out in the general setting of complex semisimple Lie groups.

takes place through elastic collisions, production and annihilation. The system
approaches a stationary state of mesons and their resonances, which is
characterized by common temperature. After equilibration, thermodynamic
quantities such as the energy density, particle density, and pressure are
calculated. From such an equilibrated state the shear viscosity coefficient is
calculated from the fluctuations of stress tensor around equilibrium using
Green--Kubo relations. We do our simulations here at zero net baryon density so
that the equilibration times depend on the energy density. We do not include
hadron strings as degrees of freedom so as to maintain detailed balance. Hence
we do not get the saturation of temperature but this leads to longer
equilibration times.

its kernel, and the extent to which it can be inverted. It is shown how the ray
transform emerges naturally in any attempt to reconstruct optical and stress
tensors within a photoelastic medium from measurements on the state of
polarization of light beams passing through the strained medium. The problem of
reconstruction of stress tensors is crucially related to the fact that the ray
transform has a nontrivial kernel; the latter is described by a theorem for
which we provide a new proof which is simpler and shorter as in Sharafutdinov's
original work, as we limit our scope to tensors which are relevant to
Photoelasticity. We explain how the kernel of the ray transform is related to
the decomposition of tensor fields into longitudinal and transverse components.
The merits of the ray transform as a tool for tensor reconstruction are studied
by walking through an explicit example of reconstructing the
$\sigma_{33}$-component of the stress tensor in a cylindrical photoelastic
specimen. In order to make the paper self-contained we provide a derivation of
the basic equations of Integrated Photoelasticity which describe how the
presence of stress within a photoelastic medium influences the passage of
polarized light through the material.

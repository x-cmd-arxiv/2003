achieved by a number of back-scattering, and so a series of emission peaks are
formed redward of the systemic redshift by back-scattering. However, majority
of observed Lya emission from starbursts show singly-peaked asymmetric
profiles. We find in this paper that, in order to form a singly-peaked Lya
emission, dust should be distributed in the ionized bubble, as well as within
the supershell of neutral hydrogen. We also find that the overall escape

distribution of dust. However, the kinematic information of the expanding

reddening curves for the radio-quiet LBQS quasars are slightly steeper than
those of the radio-loud quasars in the UV, probably because of additional
reddening by dust further out in the host galaxies of the former. The UV
extinction curves for the radio-loud AGNs are very flat. This is explicable
with slight modifications to standard MRN dust models: there is a relative lack
of small grains in the nuclear dust. Our continuum and broad-emission line
reddening curves agree in both shape and amplitude, confirming that the
continuum shape is indeed profoundly affected by reddening for all but the
bluest AGNs. With correction by our generic extinction curve, all of the
radio-loud AGNs have continuous optical-UV spectra consistent with a single
shape. We show that radio-quiet AGNs have very similar intrinsic UV to optical
shape over orders of magnitude in luminosity. We also argue that radio-loud and
radio-quiet AGNs probably share the same underlying continuum shape and that
most of the systematic differences between their observed continuum shapes are
due to higher nuclear reddening in radio-selected AGNs, and additional
reddening from dust further out in the host galaxies in radio-quiet AGNs. Our
conclusions have important implications for the modelling of quasar continua

arms are modelled by the hydrodynamical simulations we used to constrain the
dark matter fraction in nearby spiral galaxies (Kranz et al. 2001, 2003). More
specifically, we explore the dependence of the positions and amplitudes of
features in the gas flow on the temperature of the interstellar medium (assumed
to behave as a one-component isothermal fluid), the non-axisymmetric disk
contribution to the galactic potential, the pattern speed, Omega_p, and finally
the numerical resolution of the simulation. We argue that, after constraining
the pattern speed reasonably well by matching the simulations to the observed
spiral arm morphology, the amplitude of the non-axisymmetric perturbation (the
disk fraction) is left as the primary parameter determining the gas dynamics.
However, due to the sensitivity of the positions of the shocks to modeling
parameters, one has to be cautious when quantitatively comparing the
simulations to observations. In particular, we show that a global least squares
analysis is not the optimal method for distinguishing different models as it
tends to slightly favor low disk fraction models. Nevertheless, we conclude
that, given observational data of reasonably high spatial resolution and an
accurate shock-resolving hydro-code this method tightly constrains the dark
matter content within spiral galaxies. We further argue that even if the
perturbations induced by spiral arms are weaker than those of strong bars, they
are better suited for this kind of analysis because the spiral arms extend to
larger radii where effects like inflows due to numerical viscosity and
morphological dependence on gas sound speed are less of a concern than they are
in the centers of disks.

segregation, or they are primordial. Probably all OB stars thus form in stellar
clusters together with low-mass stars, and they have a rather devastating
effect on the embedded cluster by rapidly driving out the remaining gas leaving
expanding OB associations and bound star clusters. The distributed population
of OB stars has a measured IMF with alpha about 4, which however, does not
necessarily constitute a different physical mode for isolated star formation. A
steep field-star IMF is obtained naturally because stars form in clusters which

to attempt a solution to a problem encountered by the ``disk-fluorescence

straight part of AGN jet, and used the data of axisymmetric simulation. The FRM
distribution we derived has a general tendency to have gradient across the jet
axis, which is due to the toroidal component of the helical magnetic field
generated by the rotation of the accretion disk. This kind of gradient in the
FRM distribution is actually observed in some AGN jets (e.g. Asada et al.

our MHD model. Following this success, we are now extending our numerical

predicted by the synthesis models of the CXB. This finding, detected for the
first time in this survey, therefore suggests that most of the heavily obscured
objects which make up the bulk of the CXB will be found at lower fluxes
(F(2-10)< 10^(-14) erg/cm2/s). This mismatch together with other recent
observational evidences which contrast with CXB model predictions suggest that
one (or more) of the assumptions usually included in these models need to be
revised.

an experiment could also directly detect the gravitational wave component of
the B-mode spectrum if the amplitude of the signal is close to current upper

efficiency, we have carried out full binary evolution calculations for about
2300 close WD binary systems and mapped out the initial parameters in the

Accompanying the development of a LOFAR prototype station dedicated to the
observation of radio emission from extensive air showers, LOPES, we therefore
take a new approach to modeling the emission process, interpreting it as
""coherent geosynchrotron emission"" from electron-positron pairs gyrating in the
earth's magnetic field. We develop our model in a step-by-step procedure
incorporating increasingly realistic shower geometries in order to disentangle
the coherence effects arising from the different scales present in the air
shower structure and assess their influence on the spectrum and radial
dependence of the emitted radiation. We infer that the air shower ""pancake""
thickness directly limits the frequency range of the emitted radiation, while
the radial dependence of the emission is mainly governed by the intrinsic
beaming cone of the synchrotron radiation and the superposition of the emission
over the air shower evolution as a whole. Our model succeeds in reproducing the
qualitative trends in the emission spectrum and radial dependence that were
observed in the past, and is consistent with the absolute level of the emission

intergalactic medium (IGM) at redshifts z = 2.3-2.9 toward HE 2347-4342, using
spectra from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and the
Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) on the VLT telescope. Following
up on our earlier study (Kriss et al. 2001, Science, 293, 1112), we focus here
on two major topics: (1) small-scale variability (Delta z = 10^-3) in the ratio
eta = N(He II)/N(H I); and (2) an observed correlation of high-eta absorbers
(soft radiation fields) with voids in the (H I) Ly-alpha distribution. These
effects may reflect fluctuations in the ionizing sources on scales of 1 Mpc,
together with radiative transfer through a filamentary IGM whose opacity
variations control the penetration of 1-5 ryd radiation over 30-40 Mpc
distances. Owing to photon statistics and backgrounds, we can measure optical
depths over the ranges 0.1 < tau(HeII) < 2.3 and 0.02 < tau(HI) < 3.9, and
reliably determine values of eta = 4 tau(HeII)/tau(HI) over the range 0.1 to
460. Values of eta = 20-200 are consistent with models of photoionization by
quasars with observed spectral indices alpha_s = 0-3. Values of eta > 200 may
require additional contributions from starburst galaxies, heavily filtered
quasar radiation, or density variations. Regions with eta < 30 may indicate the
presence of local hard sources. We find that eta is higher in ""void"" regions,
where H I is weak or undetected and 80% of the path length has eta > 100. These
voids may be ionized by soft sources (dwarf starbursts) or by QSO radiation
softened by escape from the AGN cores or transfer through the ""cosmic web"". The
apparent differences in ionizing spectra may help to explain the 1.45 Gyr lag
between the reionization epochs, z(HI) = 6.2 +/-0.2 and z(HeII) = 2.8 +/-0.2.

The positions of the rises are consistent at the 3% level with the above law

this technique is applied on such a sample. We first calculate the accuracy of

sub-sample of our QSO sample: for the majority (~67%) of the objects in this
sub-sample, photometric redshift estimates are correct within Dz<0.3. We then
derive the photometric redshift distribution for the whole QSO sample. In the
future, we expect to use the photometric redshift distribution in order to
derive the distributions of properties such as the Hardness Ratio and hence the

estimate here the dependence of the Hardness Ratio of the QSO sample on

prevalent at growth, we find that the formation energies are lower for
Mn$_{Ga}$ over interstitial Mn (Mn$_i$).As the Fermi energy is shifted towards
the valence band maximum via external $p$-doping, the formation energy of
Mn$_i$ is reduced relative to Mn$_{Ga}$. Furthermore, under epitaxial growth
conditions, the solubility of both substitutional and interstitial Mn are
strongly enhanced over what is possible under bulk growth conditions. The high
concentration of Mn attained under epitaxial growth of p-type material opens
the possibility of Mn atoms forming small clusters. We consider various types
of clusters, including the Coulomb-stabilized clusters involving two Mn$_{Ga}$

destroy ferromagnetism,complexes such as Mn$_{Ga}$-Mn$_i$-Mn$_{Ga}$) are found
to be more stable than complexes involving Mn$_{Ga}$-Mn$_{Ga}$-Mn$_{Ga}$. The
former complexes exhibit partial or total quenching of holes, yet Mn$_i$ in
these complexes provide a channel for a ferromagnetic arrangement of the spins
on the two Mn$_{Ga}$ within the complex. This suggests that ferromagnetism in
Mn doped GaAs arises both from holes due to isolated Mn$_{Ga}$ as well as from
strongly Coulomb stabilized Mn$_{Ga}$-Mn$_i$-Mn$_{Ga}$ clusters.

equation of state is chosen the Friedmann equations are used to determine the
evolution of the FRW scale factor a(t). In contrast, a retrodictive approach
might usefully take observational dataconcerning the scale factor, and use the
Friedmann equations to infer an observed cosmological equation of state. In
particular, the value and derivatives of the scale factor determined at the
current epoch place constraints on the value and derivatives of the
cosmological equation of state at the current epoch. Determining the first
three Taylor coefficients of the equation of state at the current epoch
requires a measurement of the deceleration, jerk, and snap -- the second,
third, and fourth derivatives of the scale factor with respect to time.
Higher-order Taylor coefficients in the equation of state are related to
higher-order time derivatives of the scale factor. Since the jerk and snap are
rather difficult to measure, being related to the third and fourth terms in the
Taylor series expansion of the Hubble law, it becomes clear why direct
observational constraints on the cosmological equation of state are so
relatively weak; and are likely to remain weak for the foreseeable future.

(large-scale $\sim Mpc$) magnetic fields in an inflationary universe. The
universe during inflation is represented by de Sitter space-time. We started
with the Maxwell equations in spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)
Cosmologies. Then we calculated the wave equations of the magnetic field and
electric field for the evolution. We consider the input current that was
produced from a massless charged scalar complex field. This field minimally
coupled to both gravity and the electromagnetic fields. The Lagrangian for
massless scalar electrodynamics is then
$L=\sqrt{-g}(D_\mu\phi(D^\mu\phi)^*-{1/4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu})$ . The complex
scalar field couples to electromagnetism through the usual gauge covariant
derivative $D_\mu=\partial_\mu-ieA_\mu$ . After the quantum field theoretical
deduction for the current, we put it back into the wave equation of the
magnetic field.
  After solving this wave equation, our result is $a^2B\sim
\frac{eH}{\sqrt{2}k^2}\mid\sin\sqrt{2}k\eta\mid$ . At the time $\eta_{RH}$ we
have $B_{RH}=\frac{e}{k_{phys}}$. This may imply that the breaking of the
conformal invariance due to the minimal coupling of a massless charged scalar
complex field to both gravitational and electromagnetic fields is not
sufficient for the production of seed galactic magnetic fields during
inflation. But since we are interested in the large-scale cosmological magnetic
field, this could be still a candidate, because of the $1/k$ factor.

can be used to exactly implement an (n+1)-qubit parity gate, which is
equivalent in constant depth to an (n+1)-qubit fanout gate. We also observe
that evolving the Hamiltonian for three qubits results in an
inversion-on-three-way-equality gate, which together with single-qubit
operations is universal for quantum computation.

that a 29-Si nuclear spin qubit in a solid silicon crystal at room temperature
can preserve quantum phase for 10^9 precessional periods. The coherence times
we report are longer than for any other observed solid-state qubit by more than
four orders of magnitude. In high quality crystals, these times are limited by
residual dipolar couplings and can be further improved by isotopic depletion.
In defect-heavy samples, we provide evidence for decoherence limited by 1/f
noise. These results provide insight toward proposals for solid-state
nuclear-spin-based quantum memories and quantum computers based on silicon.

are derived from those defined in the extended Fock space with negative number

number-phase function uniquely. To show this fact explicitly, we propose
another function satisfying all these conditions. It is also shown that the
ununiqueness of the number-phase Wigner function result from the

processing. However, copying seems rather different in the quantum regime.
Since the discovery of the universal quantum cloning machine, much has been
found from the fundamental point of view about quantum copying. But a basic
question as to the utility of universal quantum cloning remains. We have
considered its application in quantum state restoration by using cloning
circuit for state estimation. It might be expected that classical information
from the state estimation might help restore the quantum state that was
disturbed during transmission. We find that the fidelity of the final state is,
interestingly, independent of error probabilities inside the channel. However,
this also turns out to impose a severe constraint on our original aims.

operating inside a high finesse ring cavity. A simplified theoretical model for
the dynamics of the system is developed upon the assumption of adiabaticity of
the atomic motion. We show that in a regime where the light shift per photon
times the number of atoms exceeds the line width of the cavity resonance, the
otherwise tiny retro-action of the atoms upon the light field becomes a
significant feature of the system, giving rise to dispersive optical
bistability of the intra-cavity field. A solution of the complete set of
classical equations of motion confirms these finding, however additional
non-adiabatic phenomena are predicted, as for example self-induced radial
breathing oscillations. We compare these results with experiments involving
laser-cooled 85Rb atoms trapped in an optical lattice inside a ring cavity with
a finesse of 180000. Temperature measurements conducted for moderate values of
the atom-cavity interaction demonstrate that intensity-noise induced heating is
kept at a very low level, a prerequisite for our further experiments. When we
operate at large values of the atom--cavity interaction we observe bistability
and breathing oscillations in excellent agreement with our theoretical
predictions.

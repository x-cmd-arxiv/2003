designed to work at high Mach numbers encountered in astrophysical hydrodynamic
simulations. The Eulerian fluid conservation equations are solved in an
adaptive frame moving with the fluid where Mach numbers are minimized. The
moving frame approach uses a velocity decomposition technique to define local
kinetic variables while storing the bulk kinetic components in a smoothed
background velocity field that is associated with the grid velocity.
Gravitationally induced accelerations are added to the grid, thereby minimizing
the spurious heating problem encountered in cold gas flows. Separately tracking
local and bulk flow components allows thermodynamic variables to be accurately
calculated in both subsonic and supersonic regions. A main feature of the
algorithm, that is not possible in previous Eulerian implementations, is the
ability to resolve shocks and prevent spurious heating where both the preshock
and postshock Mach numbers are high. The hybrid algorithm combines the high
resolution shock capturing ability of the second-order accurate Eulerian TVD
scheme with a low-diffusion Lagrangian advection scheme. We have implemented a
cosmological code where the hydrodynamic evolution of the baryons is captured
using the moving frame algorithm while the gravitational evolution of the
collisionless dark matter is tracked using a particle-mesh N-body algorithm.
The MACH code is highly suited for simulating the evolution of the IGM where
accurate thermodynamic evolution is needed for studies of the Lyman alpha
forest, the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and the X-ray background. Hydrodynamic
and cosmological tests are described and results presented. The current code is
fast, memory-friendly, and parallelized for shared-memory machines.

temperatures, rather than by radiative cooling. We argue that this process,
when incorporated into the so-called ""moderate cooling flow model"", where the
effective age of the intracluster medium is much lower than the age of the
cluster, reduces substantially the expected X-ray luminosity from gas residing
at temperatures of <10^7 K. In this model, the radiative mass cooling rate of
gas at ~10^7 K inferred from X-ray observations, which is <20 % of the mass
cooling rates cited in the past, is easily met. The heat conduction is
regulated by reconnection between the magnetic field lines in cold (~10^4 K)
clouds and the field lines in the intracluster medium. A narrow conduction
front is formed, which, despite the relatively low temperature, allows
efficient heat conduction from the hot ICM to the cold clouds. The reconnection
between the field lines in cold clouds and those in the intracluster medium
occurs only when the magnetic field in the ICM is strong enough. This occurs
only in the very inner regions of cooling flow clusters, at r~10-30 kpc. The
large ratio of the number of H\alpha photons to the number of cooling hydrogen
atoms is explained by this scenario.

a lower gravity atmosphere. G 196-3B shows absorption features in both

a pulsar wind bubble that has expanded inside a supernova, which requires that

detectionof an unusual, high-velocity component in the Ca II infrared triplet,
similar tofeatures previously observed in SN 2000cx and SN 2001el. This feature
exhibits a large expansion velocity (~18,000 km/s) which is nearly constant
between -7 and +2 days relative to maximum light, and disappears shortly
thereafter. Otherthan this feature, the spectral evolution and light curve
resemble those of a normal SN Ia.
  We find that the Ca II feature can plausibly be caused by a dense shell
formed when circumstellar material of solar abundance is overrun by the rapidly
expanding outermost layers of the SN ejecta. Model calculations show that the
optical and infrared spectra are remarkably unaffected by the circumstellar
interaction. In particular, no hydrogen lines are detectable in either
absorption or emission. The only qualitatively different features are the
strong, high-velocity feature in the Ca II IR-triplet, and a somewhat weaker O
I feature near 7,300 AA. The morphology and time evolution of these features
provide an estimate for the amount of accumulated matter and an indication of
the mixing in the dense shell. We apply these diagnostic tools to SN 2003du and
infer that about 2 x 10^{-2} M_sun of solar abundance material may have
accumulated in a circumstellar shell prior to the observations. Furthermore,
the early light curve data imply that the circumstellar material was originally
very close to the progenitor system, perhaps from an accretion disk, Roche lobe
or common envelope.

out all of the diffuse radio continuum emission related to starburst activity
to reveal three compact sources, two associated with the infrared and X-ray
nuclei: components N1, the northern nucleus, and S, the southern nucleus; and
component S1, a weak point source lying northeast of component S. The radio
continuum properties of N1 and S both resemble those of compact radio sources
in Seyfert nuclei, including an inverted spectrum at low frequencies and high
brightness temperatures. Component N1 further resolves into a 9 pc linear
source, again resembling compact jets in some well-studied Seyfert nuclei. The
inverted radio spectrum is most likely caused by free-free absorption through
foreground plasma with emission measures of order 1E7 cm^(-6) pc, consistent
with the X-ray spectroscopy which infers the presence of a foreground, Compton
thick absorber. Synchrotron self-absorption may also contribute to the flat
spectrum of component S. Component S1 better resembles a luminous radio
supernova such as those detected in Arp 220, although we cannot specifically
rule out the possibility that S1 may be ejected material from the southern
active nucleus. We demonstrate that the light curve of S1 is at least
consistent with current radio supernova models, and, given the high
star-formation rate in the nuclear region and the (possible) proclivity of
infrared merger galaxies to produce luminous RSNe, it is not surprising that
one such supernova is detected serendipitously in the VLBA observations.

candidates with redshifts 2.3 < z < 2.8 and r-band magnitudes 19.8-20.5 in the
Quasar Catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey First Data Release (SDSS DR1).
The SDSS spectra of these objects resemble the composite spectrum of Lyman
Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z ~ 3 (albeit with some differences and broader
spectral lines), but the systems are 4-5 magnitudes brighter than an ``L*'' LBG
and 2-3 magnitudes brighter than the most luminous objects in typical LBG
spectroscopic surveys. These objects could be extremely luminous LBGs, normal
LBGs amplified by gravitational lensing (like MS 1512-cB58), or a rare class of
unusual BAL quasars. Under the first hypothesis, star formation rates inferred
from the UV continuum luminosities are about 300-1000 M_sun yr^-1 with no
correction for dust extinction. The SDSS images show no evidence of multiple
imaging or foreground lensing structures, but lensing amplification cannot be
ruled out with the present data. The spectra have fairly broad absorption
features and prominent high-ionization absorption, but they do not have high
ionization emission lines, nor do they resemble spectra of known BAL quasars.
Assuming that lensing and AGN contributions are unimportant, we estimate the
high end of the z ~ 2.5 galaxy luminosity function, making the crude but
conservative assumption of unit detection efficiency over our observed redshift
and magnitude range. The estimated comoving space density is above a Schechter
function extrapolation of the LBG luminosity function from fainter magnitudes.
Improved optical spectra and measurements at X-ray, IR, and sub-mm wavelengths
could help determine the nature of these remarkable objects.

properties than stars implying that they cannot have the same formation
history. They are rather unfinished stars having either been ejected by their
siblings from compact groups of accreting hydrostatic cores, or having lost
their accretion envelopes through photo-evaporation by nearby O stars or
through hyperbolic encounters with other accreting cores in their birth
clusters. All three scenarios are studied with a view to understanding the
observed smaller number of brown dwarfs (BDs) per star in the Taurus
star-forming region as opposed to the larger number of BDs per star seen in the
Orion Nebula cluster. It is found that both environments can produce the same
number of ejected BDs per star if the true production rate is about one BD per
four stars and the ejection velocity is about 2 km/s. This production rate is
much lower than the number of BDs per star inferred for the Galactic field.
Adding photo-evaporated and collisional BDs cannot reconcile this difference.
The only possible solution would be to postulate that tranquil star-formation
such as in Taurus is producing about one BD per star with ejection velocities
of about 3 km/s, while Orion-Nebula-type clusters produce at most about one BD
per three stars. Unless the Galactic-field census of BDs has been
overestimated, this then would imply that low-mass star-forming regions may be
the primary source of the field BDs, rather than rich clusters.

soft X-ray transient V404 Cyg obtained with ULTRACAM. Superimposed on the
secondary star's ellipsoidal modulation are large flares on timescales of a few
hours, as well as several distinct rapid flares on timescales of tens of mins.
The rapid flares, most of which show further variability and unresolved peaks,
cover shorter timescales than those reported in previous observations. The
power density spectrum (PDS) of the 5 s time-resolution data shows a
quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature at 0.78 mHz (=21.5 min). Assuming this
periodicity represents the Keplerian period at the transition between the thin
and advective disc regions, we determine the transition radius. We discuss the
possible origins for the QPO feature in the context of the advection-dominated
accretion flow model.
  We determine the colour of the large flares and find that the i' band flux
per unit frequency interval is larger than that in the g' band. The colour is
consistent with optically thin gas with a temperature of ~8000 K arising from a
region with an equivalent blackbody radius of at least 2 Ro, which covers 3
percent of the accretion disc's surface. Our timing and spectral analysis
results support the idea that the rapid flares (i.e. the QPO feature) most
likely arise from regions near the transition radius.

investigate the impact of the cluster environment on the star formation and AGN
activity in the member galaxies. The X-ray selection criterion is adopted to
focus on the most massive and dynamically relaxed clusters. A large majority of
cluster galaxies show an excess in radio emission over that predicted from the
radio-FIR correlation, the fraction of sources with radio excess increases
toward cluster cores, and the radial gradient in the FIR/radio flux ratio is a
result of radio enhancement. Of the radio-excess sources, 70% are early-type
galaxies and the same fraction host an AGN. The galaxy density drops by a
factor of 10 from the composite cluster center out to 1.5 Mpc, yet galaxies
show no change in FIR properties over this region, and show no indication of
mass segregation. We have examined in detail the physical mechanisms that might
impact the FIR and radio emission of cluster galaxies. While collisional
heating of dust may be important for galaxies in cluster centers, it appears to
have a negligible effect on the observed FIR emission for our sample galaxies.
The correlations between radio and FIR luminosity and radius could be explained
by magnetic compression from thermal ICM pressure. We also find that simple
delayed harassment cannot fully account for the observed radio, FIR, and mid-IR
properties of cluster galaxies.

large samples of confirmed quasars can provide a direct measurement (or
interesting lower limit) to the lifetime of an individual episode of quasar
activity (t_Q) and potentially enable the study of post-quasar host galaxies.
Photometric observations of the quasars found by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) and 2dF Survey could, with a time baseline of ten years, determine t_Q
to within a factor of two if t_Q < 10^5 years, or set a lower limit to the
quasar lifetime. Multiple-epoch, precise photometry with the proposed Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope could test more complex models for quasar variability
and mean quasar luminosity evolution. These observations could also constrain
the rate that tidal disruptions of single stars produce quasar luminosities.
  It is possible to reverse the order of this investigation; previous-epoch
plate material, such as the Digitized Sky Survey, can be used to determine if
any of the SDSS quasars had not yet turned on at the time of these prior
observations. Measurements of the entire SDSS quasar sample over the ~50 year
baseline provided by these plates can potentially be used to estimate t_Q to
within a factor of two if t_Q < 10^{5.5} years, provided quasar variability can
be accurately characterized and the detection efficiency and photometric
calibration of the plate material can be well determined. These measurements of
t_Q will have comparable quality to existing, more indirect estimates of the
quasar lifetime. Analysis of the 3814 quasars in the SDSS Early Data Release
finds that t_Q must be larger than approximately 20,000 years.

are approximately consistent with their respective solar values, while others
are depleted by factors that range from a few up to around 1000. These
depletions are caused by the atoms condensing into solid form onto dust grains.
Their strengths are governed by the volatility of compounds that are produced,
together with the densities and velocities of the gas clouds. We may
characterize the depletion trends in terms of a limited set of parameters; ones
derived here are based on measurements of 15 elements toward 144 stars with
known values of N(H I) and N(H2). In turn, these parameters may be applied to
studies of the production, destruction, and composition of the dust grains. The
interpretations must be done with care, however, since in some cases deviations
from the classical assumptions about missing atoms in unseen ionization stages
can create significant errors. Our experience with the disk of our Galaxy
offers important lessons for properly unravelling results for more distant
systems, such as high- and intermediate-velocity clouds in the Galactic halo,
material in the Magellanic Stream and Magellanic Clouds, and otherwise
invisible gas systems at large redshifts (detected by absorption features in

from the structure formation point of view. A more correct statement however is
that DM indeed experiences collisional damping, but on a scale which is
supposed to be too small to be relevant for structure formation. The aim of
this paper is to present a Cold (although ``collisional'') Dark Matter particle
whose matter power spectrum is damped and see whether it is distinguishable
from standard candidates. To achieve this purpose, we calculate the collisional
damping and free-streaming scales of neutralinos and non conventional
candidates (say light particles heavier than ~1 MeV but lighter than O(10)
GeV). The latter can be considered as Cold Dark Matter (CDM) particles in the
sense that they become non relativistic before their thermal decoupling epoch.
Unlike neutralinos, however, their linear matter power spectrum can be damped
on scales of ~ 10^3 Msol due to their interactions. Since these scales are of
cosmological interest for structure formation, we perform a series of numerical
simulations to obtain the corresponding non linear matter power spectra
P(k)_{nl} at the present epoch. We show that because of small scale
regeneration, they all resemble each other at low redshifts, i.e. become very
similar to a typical CDM matter power spectrum on all but the smallest scales.
Therefore, even if lensing measurements at redshift below unity were to yield a
P(k)_{nl} consistent with CDM models, this would not constitute a sufficiently
robust evidence in favour of the neutralino to rule out alternative DM
candidates.

samples are examined with 85 spectroscopically identified objects and by Monte
Carlo simulations. We find in the luminosity functions of LBGs (i) that the
number density of bright galaxies (M_{1700}<-22; corresponding to
SFR_{corr}>100 Msolar yr^{-1}) decreases significantly from z=4 to 5 and (ii)
that the faint-end slope of the luminosity function may become steeper towards
higher redshifts. We estimate dust extinction of z=4 LBGs with M<M^* from UV
slopes, and obtain E(B-V)=0.15+/-0.03 as the mean value. The dust extinction
remains constant with apparent luminosity, but increases with intrinsic
luminosity. We find no evolution in dust extinction between LBGs at z=3 and 4.
We investigate the evolution of UV-luminosity density at 1700A, rho, and find
that rho does not significantly change from z=3 to z=5, i.e.,
rho(z=4)/rho(z=3)=1.0+/-0.2 and rho(z=5)/rho(z=3)=0.8+/-0.4, thus the cosmic
star-formation rate (SFR) density remains constant. We find that the stellar
mass density estimated from the cosmic SFR is consistent with those derived
directly from the stellar mass function at z=0-1, but exceeds those at z~3 by a
factor of 3. We find that the ratio of the UV-luminosity density of Ly-a
emitters (LAEs) to that of LBGs is ~60% at z=5, and thus about a half of the
star formation at z=5 probably occurs in LAEs. We obtain a constraint on the

and dynamics of Abell 168 are investigated. In the light of the spatial
distribution of the member galaxies and the 0.2-3.5 keV X-ray image by Einstein

relative radial velocity of 264 +/- 142 km/s. With the help of ROSTAT software,
a detailed investigation of the dynamics shows the intrinsic difference in the
velocity distributions for these two subclusters. Under a linear two-body
model, they are found to be a gravitationally bound system with 92%
probability. The slight deviation of the local velocity distribution from the
overall distribution in the central region may suggest a picture of head-on
collision in the projection plane. By using a double Schechter function, the
close examination of the luminosity functions reveals the different galaxy
content of these two subclusters, which implies the merging process is possibly
at the early stage.

explained by a significant radial redistribution of angular momentum in the

Ia) at optical and IR wavelengths. We find a B-band risetime of 17.9+-0.5 days,
a Dm_{15}(B) of 1.13+-0.05, and a M_B=-19.41+-0.42. However, comparison with
other type Ia supernovae having similar Delta m_{15}(B) values indicates that
in other respects SN 2002bo is unusual. While the optical spectra of SN 2002bo
are very similar to those of SN 1984A, lower velocities and a generally more
structured appearance are found in SNe 1990N, 1994D and 1998bu. For supernovae
having Dm_(15)(B) > 1.2, we confirm the variation of R(SiII) (Nugent et al.
1995) with Dm_(15)(B). However, for supernovae such as SN2002bo, with lower
values of Dm_(15)(B) the relation breaks down. Moreover, the evolution of
R(SiII) for SN 2002bo is strikingly different from that shown by other type Ia
supernovae. The velocities of SN 2002bo and 1984A derived from SII 5640A, SiII
6355A and CaII H&K lines are either much higher and/or evolve differently from
those seen in other normal SNe Ia events. We suggest that the unusually low
temperature, the presence of high-velocity intermediate-mass elements and the
low abundance of carbon at early times indicates that burning to Si penetrated
to much higher layers than in more normal type Ia supernovae. This may be
indicative of a delayed-detonation explosion.

from a finite radial component of the mean magnetic field at the disc surface.
This leads to an integro-differential operator in the equation for the radial
distribution of the mean magnetic field strength, $Q(r)$ in the disc plane at a
distance $r$ from its centre; an asymptotic form of its solution at large
distances from the dynamo active region is obtained. Numerical solutions of the
integro-differential equation confirm that the non-local effects act similarly
to an enhanced magnetic diffusion. This leads to a wider radial distribution of
the eigensolution and faster propagation of magnetic fronts, compared to
solutions with the radial surface field neglected. Another result of non-local
effects is a slowly decaying algebraic tail of the eigenfunctions outside the
dynamo active region, $Q(r)\sim r^{-4}$, which is shown to persist in nonlinear
solutions where $\alpha$-quenching is included. The non-local nature of the
solutions can affect the radial profile of the regular magnetic field in spiral
galaxies and accretion discs at large distances from the centre.

dark matter (DM) is coupled to dark energy (DE), so easing the cosmic

N-body dynamics: (i) DM particle masses vary with time; (ii) gravity between DM
particles is ruled by a constant $G^{*}$, greater than Newton's constant $G$,
holding in other 2-body interactions. As a consequence, baryons and DM particle
distributions develop a large scale bias. Here we investigate DE models with
Ratra-Peebles (RP) potentials; the dark-dark coupling is set in a parametric
range compatible with observations, for as concern background and linear
perturbation properties. We study the halo mass function, the halo density
profile and the behavior of the non-linear bias. We find that non-linear
dynamics puts additional constraints to the coupling parameter. They mostly
arise from density profiles, that we find to yield higher concentrations, in
coupled RP models, with respect to (uncoupled) dynamical DE cosmologies. Such
enhancement, although being a strong effect in some coupling parameter range,
is just a minor change for smaller but significant values of the coupling
parameter. With these further restrictions, coupled DE models with RP potential
are consistent with non-linear observables.

the magnetic field created by the Tayler instability. In stellar regions, where
magnetic field can be generated by the dynamo due to differential rotation
(Spruit 2002), we find that the growth rate of the magnetic instability is much
faster than for the thermal instability. Thus, meridional circulation is
negligible with respect to the magnetic fields, both for the transport of
angular momentum and of chemical elements. Also, the horizontal coupling by the
magnetic field, which reaches values of a few $10^5$ G, is much more important
than the effects of the horizontal turbulence. The field, however, is not
sufficient to distort the shape of the equipotentials. We impose the condition
that the energy of the magnetic field created by the Tayler--Spruit dynamo
cannot be larger than the energy excess present in the differential rotation.
This leads to a criterion for the existence of the magnetic field in stellar
interiors. Numerical tests are made in a rotating star model of 15 M$_{\odot}$
rotating with an initial velocity of 300 km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$.

the evolution of the phonon-rotation coupling at varying temperature. It
increases strongly when the character of CH4 rotation changes from the quantum

observed, whose position varies from 9.7 K to 8.4 K when the CH4 concentration

because of this morphology, point-contact measurements turned out to be rather

are confined to a Stiefel manifold of tall, orthogonal matrices and we
introduce a natural gradient variant of the algorithm which is appropriate to
learning on this manifold. For large input dimension the parameter trajectory
of both algorithms passes through a sequence of unstable fixed points, each
described by a diffusion process in a polynomial potential. Choosing the
learning rate too large increases the escape time from each of these fixed
points, effectively trapping the learning in a sub-optimal state. In order to
avoid these trapping states a very low learning rate must be chosen during the
learning transient, resulting in learning time-scales of $O(N^2)$ or $O(N^3)$
iterations where $N$ is the data dimension. Escape from each sub-optimal state
results in a sequence of symmetry breaking events as the algorithm learns each
source in turn. This is in marked contrast to the learning dynamics displayed
by related on-line learning algorithms for multilayer neural networks and
principal component analysis. Although the natural gradient variant of the
algorithm has nice asymptotic convergence properties, it has an equivalent
transient dynamics to the standard Hebbian algorithm.

signal singular changes in the essential features of the global structure of
the network. Depending on the energy function chosen, the observed transitions

size of the largest connected component divided by the number of edges, or
Phi_k=k_{max}/M, the largest degree in the network divided by the number of

been to prove Price's law for an appropriate model of gravitational collapse.
This law postulates inverse-power decay rates for the gravitational radiation
flux on the event horizon and null infinity with respect to appropriately
normalized advanced and retarded time coordinates. It is intimately related
both to astrophysical observations of black holes and to the fate of observers
who dare cross the event horizon. In this paper, we prove a well-defined (upper
bound) formulation of Price's law for the collapse of a self-gravitating scalar
field with spherically symmetric initial data. We also allow the presence of an
additional gravitationally coupled Maxwell field. Our results are obtained by a
new mathematical technique for understanding the long-time behavior of large
data solutions to the resulting coupled non-linear hyperbolic system of
p.d.e.'s in 2 independent variables. The technique is based on the interaction
of the conformal geometry, the celebrated red-shift effect, and local energy
conservation; we feel it may be relevant for the problem of non-linear
stability of the Kerr solution. When combined with previous work of the first
author (gr-qc/0307013) concerning the internal structure of charged black
holes, which assumed the validity of Price's law, our results can be applied to
the strong cosmic censorship conjecture for the Einstein-Maxwell-real scalar
field system with complete spacelike asymptotically flat spherically symmetric

  358",,,"gr-qc",,"  In the context of the recently proposed formulation of quantum
geometrodynamics in extended phase space we discuss the problem how the
behavior of the Universe, initially managed by quantum laws, has become
classical. In this version of quantum geometrodynamics we quantize gauge
gravitational degrees of freedom on an equal basis with physical degrees of
freedom. As a consequence of this approach, a wave function of the Universe
depends not only on physical fields but also on gauge degrees of freedom. From
this viewpoint, one should regard the physical Universe as a subsystem whose
properties are formed in interaction with the subsystem of gauge degrees of
freedom. We argue that the subsystem of gauge degrees of freedom may play the
role of environment, which, being taken into account, causes the density matrix
to be diagonal. We show that under physically reasonable fixing of gauge
condition the density matrix describing the physical subsystem of the Universe
may have a Gaussian peak in some variable, but it could take the Gaussian form
only within a spacetime region where a certain gauge condition is imposed. If
spacetime manifold consists of regions covered by different coordinate charts
the Universe cannot behave in a classical manner nearby borders of these
regions. Moreover, in this case the Universe could not stay in the same quantum
state, but its state would change in some irreversible way.

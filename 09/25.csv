significant constraints on the dominant types of plasma oscillation throughout
the corona and wind. The dissipation of MHD fluctuations of some kind, probably
involving anisotropic turbulent cascade, is believed to dominate the heating of

acquired Hubble Space Telescope images to demonstrate that the H2 emission

41.3 +/- 2.1 Mpc (33.08 +/- 0.11 mag), about the same distance as of the
``Great Attractor''. We find a distance difference of 0.27 +/- 0.34 mag between

separated by their Hubble flow distance. A distance difference of 0.48 +/- 0.21
mag is found between the central galaxies NGC 4696 (Cen30) and NGC 4709 (Cen45)
of both components, supported by the different turn-over magnitudes of their
respective globular cluster systems. This suggests that Cen45 is falling into
but has not yet reached Cen30, supporting the idea of a large scale filament
along the line of sight towards Centaurus (Churazov et al. 1999). H_0=83.0 +/-
8.3 km/s/Mpc is obtained for our Cen30 sample. This value corresponds to a much
smaller Hubble flow distortion in the direction of Centaurus than determined by
Tonry et al. (2000), implying that the GA mass estimate by Tonry et al. may be
too high and/or that the Centaurus cluster falls into the GA almost
perpendicularly to the line of sight. As our mean single measurement error is
very close to the measured distance scatter of the investigated galaxies, we
can only derive an upper limit of +/- 10 Mpc radial extension for the Centaurus
cluster. No evidence for an infall pattern into the Great Attractor is found

minimal tree-model and the stellar model. Both models give identical results
for the statistics of the 3-d density contrast smoothed over spherical cells
and only differ by the detailed angular dependence of the many-body density
correlations. We have shown in previous work that they also yield almost
identical results for the pdf of the smoothed convergence, $\kappa_s$. We find
that both models give rather close results for both the shear and the positive
tail of the aperture-mass. However, we note that at small angular scales
($\theta_s \la 2'$) the tail of the pdf $\cP(\Map)$ for negative $\Map$ shows a
strong variation between the two models and the stellar model actually breaks
down for $\theta_s \la 0.4'$ and $\Map<0$. This shows that the statistics of
the aperture-mass provides a very precise probe of the detailed structure of
the density field, as it is sensitive to both the amplitude and the detailed
angular behaviour of the many-body correlations. On the other hand, the minimal
tree-model shows good agreement with numerical simulations over all scales and
redshifts of interest, while both models provide a good description of the pdf
$\cP(\gamma_{is})$ of the smoothed shear components. Therefore, the shear and
the aperture-mass provide robust and complimentary tools to measure the
cosmological parameters as well as the detailed statistical properties of the

the two states shows a energy-dependent flux variation. A soft excess, a narrow
iron line and a Compton reflection hump above 10 keV, are clearly apparent in
the residuals after fitting the spectra with a simple power law. We tested two
alternative models. In the first the iron line and the high energy bump are
well reproduced by reprocessing in a cold and Compton thick material. The
intensity of the iron line (also consistent with a Chandra measurement) as well
as the normalization of the reflection hump are consistent with a constant in
the two epochs: this, combined with the fact that the line is narrow as
observed by Chandra, suggests a common origin from distant and optically thick
matter. This model further requires a component to model the soft excess: the
empirical choice of two black bodies accounts well for the excess in both
observations, their combined strength was a factor about three higher in the
high than in the low flux state defined above. However the relative
contribution of the soft excess is higher in the low flux state. In the second
model we attempted to reproduce all spectral features, except for the narrow
cold line, with reflection from an ionized disc. This model is successful only
in the high flux state,but it fails in the low flux state, when the soft excess
is only partially accounted for. In either models, the slope of the power law
is larger in the high than in the low flux state, in agreement with a behaviour
known to be shared by several objects of the same type.

directly from the width of [OIII] line. We found that the radio-quiet AGNs

There are two plausible interpretations for the deviation of radio-loud AGNs.

overestimated because of the overestimation of optical luminosity, the other is
that the dynamics of BLRs and/or narrow line regions (NLRs) in radio-loud AGNs
is different from that in radio-quiet AGNs. The deviation of NLS1s may be due
to the small inclination of BLRs to the line of sight or the reliability of

waves, which can oscillate on a much shorter timescale than that associated
with the primary instability. The phenomenon is studied by direct numerical
simulation using a, with respect to time, implicit Lagrangian scheme, which
allows for the variation by several orders of magnitude of the dependent
variables. The timestep for the simulation of the system is reduced appreciably
by the shock oscillations and prevents its long term study. A procedure based
on domain decomposition is proposed to surmount the difficulty of vastly
different timescales in various regions of the stellar envelope and thus to
enable the desired long term simulations. Criteria for domain decomposition are
derived and the proper treatment of the resulting inner boundaries is
discussed. Tests of the approach are presented and its viability is
demonstrated by application to a model for the star P Cygni. In this
investigation primarily the feasibility of domain decomposition for the problem
considered is studied. We intend to use the results as the basis of an
extension to two dimensional simulations.

Detailed balance violations can be implemented isotropically by allowing for
different effective temperatures for the heat baths coupling to the slow modes.
In the case of model D with conserved order parameter, the energy density
fluctuations can be integrated out. For model C with scalar order parameter, in
equilibrium governed by strong dynamic scaling (z_S = z_rho), we find no
genuine nonequilibrium fixed point. The nonequilibrium critical dynamics of
model C with n = 1 thus follows the behavior of other systems with nonconserved
order parameter wherein detailed balance becomes effectively restored at the

parameter. However, for n = 2 and n = 3, in the weak dynamic scaling regime
(z_S <= z_rho) entire lines of genuine nonequilibrium model C fixed points
emerge to one-loop order, which are characterized by continuously varying
critical exponents. Similarly, the nonequilibrium model C with spatially
anisotropic noise and n < 4 allows for continuously varying exponents, yet with
strong dynamic scaling. Subjecting model D to anisotropic nonequilibrium
perturbations leads to genuinely different critical behavior with softening
only in subsectors of momentum space and correspondingly anisotropic scaling
exponents. Similar to the two-temperature model B the effective theory at
criticality can be cast into an equilibrium model D dynamics, albeit
incorporating long-range interactions of the uniaxial dipolar type.

dynamics that includes reproduction, death, and competition. The population is
assumed to be confined in a refuge beyond which conditions are so harsh that
they lead to certain extinction. Standard continuum mean field models in one
dimension yield a critical refuge length L_c such that a population in a refuge
larger than this is assured survival. Herein we extend the model to take into
account the discreteness and finiteness of the population, which leads us to a
stochastic description. We present a particular critical criterion for likely
extinction, namely, that the standard deviation of the population be equal to
the mean. According to this criterion, we find that while survival can no
longer be guaranteed for any refuge size, for sufficiently weak competition one
can make the refuge large enough (certainly larger than L_c) to cause
extinction to be unlikely. However, beyond a certain value of the competition
rate parameter it is no longer possible to escape a likelihood of extinction
even in an infinite refuge. These unavoidable fluctuations therefore have a
severe impact on refuge design issues.

functional for such universes is exhibited. We show how the probabilities of
decoherent sets of alternative, coarse-grained histories of these model
universes can be calculated. We consider in particular the probabilities for
classical evolution defined by a suitable coarse-graining. For a restricted
class of initial conditions and coarse grainings we exhibit the approximate
decoherence of alternative histories in which the universe behaves classically
and those in which it does not. For these situations we show that the
probability is near unity for the universe to recontract classically if it
expands classically. We also determine the relative probabilities of
quasi-classical trajectories for initial states of WKB form, recovering for
such states a precise form of the familiar heuristic ""J d\Sigma"" rule of
quantum cosmology, as well as a generalization of this rule to generic initial
states.

employing the one-plaquette gauge action and the standard Wilson quark action.
Performing a series of simulations for the number of flavors $N_F=6$--360 with
degenerate-mass quarks, we find that when $N_F \ge 7$ there is a line of a bulk
first order phase transition between the confined phase and a deconfined phase
at a finite current quark mass in the strong coupling region and the
intermediate coupling region. The massless quark line exists only in the
deconfined phase. Based on these numerical results in the strong coupling limit
and in the intermediate coupling region, we propose the following phase
structure, depending on the number of flavors whose masses are less than
$\Lambda_d$ which is the physical scale characterizing the phase transition in
the weak coupling region: When $N_F \ge 17$, there is only a trivial IR fixed
point and therefore the theory in the continuum limit is free. On the other
hand, when $16 \ge N_F \ge 7$, there is a non-trivial IR fixed point and
therefore the theory is non-trivial with anomalous dimensions, however, without
quark confinement. Theories which satisfy both quark confinement and
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the continuum limit exist only for $N_F

possible scenarios beyond the Standard Model. In both scenarios, Dirac
neutrinos are assumed to be massive.
  First, we consider how the existence of CP violation phase between the
complex vector V and axial A couplings of the Left-handed neutrinos affects the
azimuthal dependence of the differential cross section. The future superbeam
and neutrino factory experiments will provide the unique opportunity for the
leptonic CP violation studies, if the large magnetized sampling calorimeters
with good event reconstruction capabilities are build.
  Next, we take into account a scenario with the participation of the exotic
scalar S coupling of the Right-handed neutrinos in addition to the standard
vector V and axial A couplings of the Left-handed neutrinos. The main goal is
to show how the presence of the R-handed neutrinos, in the above process
changes the spectrum of recoil electrons in relation to the expected Standard
Model prediction, using the current limits on the non-standard couplings. The
interference terms between the standard and exotic couplings in the
differential cross section depend on the angle $\alpha$ between the transverse
incoming neutrino polarization and the transverse electron polarization of the
target, and do not vanish in the limit of massless neutrino. The detection of
the dependence on this angle in the energy spectrum of recoil electrons would
be a signature of the presence of the R-handed neutrinos in the
neutrino-electron scattering. To make this test feasible, the polarized
artificial neutrino source needs to be identified.

small-world network. At low densities $p$ of directed random connections, a
localized transient stimulus results in either self-sustained persistent
activity or in a brief transient followed by failure. Averages over the
quenched ensemble reveal that the probability of failure changes from 0 to 1
over a narrow range in $p$; this failure transition can be described
analytically through an extension of an existing mean-field result. Exceedingly
long transients emerge at higher densities $p$; their activity patterns are
disordered, in contrast to the mostly periodic persistent patterns observed at
low $p$. The times at which such patterns die out are consistent with a
stretched-exponential distribution, which depends sensitively on the
propagation velocity of the excitation.

each of the total $\beta_-$ and $\beta_+$ strengths is different in the two
approximations. It is also shown that the energy-weighted sum of the GT
strengths for the $\beta_-$ and $\beta_+$ transitions in RPA is equal to the
expectation value of the double commutator of the nuclear Hamiltonian with the
GT operator, when the expectation value is calculated with the ground state in

Science Verification, of red giant branch (RGB) stars in the globular cluster
NGC 2808. A total of 137 stars was observed, of which 20 at high resolution
(R=47,000) with UVES and the others at lower resolution (R=19,000-29,000) with
GIRAFFE in MEDUSA mode, monitoring ~ 3 mag down from the RGB tip. Spectra were
taken of the Halpha, Na I D and Ca II H and K lines. This is by far the largest
and most complete collection of such data in globular cluster giants, both for
the number of stars observed within one cluster, and for monitoring all the
most important optical diagnostics of chromospheric activity/mass
motions.Evidence of mass motions in the atmospheres was searched from asymmetry
in the profiles and coreshifts of the Halpha, Na I D and Ca II K lines, as well
as from Halpha emission wings. We have set the detection thresholds for the
onset of Halpha emission, negative Na D_2 coreshifts and negative K_3
coreshifts at log L/Lsun ~ 2.5, 2.9 and 2.8, respectively. These limits are
significantly fainter than the results found by nearly all previous studies.
Also the fraction of stars where these features have been detected has been
increased significantly with respect to the previous studies. Our observations
confirm the widespread presence of chromospheres among globular cluster giants,
as it was found among Population I red giants. Some of the above diagnostics
suggest clearly the presence of outward mass motions in the atmosphere of
several stars.

with their axial counterparts, ambipolar diffusion will always be
destabilising, with unstable local modes appearing at well-defined wavenumber
bands. The wavenumber corresponding to the maximum growth rate need not, in
general, lie along the vertical axis. Growth rates become small relative to the
local angular velocity when the ion-neutral collision time exceeds the orbital
time. In common with Hall electromotive forces, ambipolar diffusion
destabilises both positive and negative angular velocity gradients. In at least
some cases, therefore, uniformly rotating molecular cloud cores may reflect the
marginally stable state of the ambipolar magnetorotational instability.

Survey (SDSS; 2400 deg^2, 0.004<z<0.08, -23.5<M_r<-15.5). We trace the
bimodality of the distribution from luminous to faint galaxies by fitting
double-Gaussians to the color functions separated in absolute magnitude bins.
Color-magnitude (CM) relations are obtained for red and blue distributions
(early- and late-type, predominantly field, galaxies) without using any cut in
morphology. Instead, the analysis is based on the assumption of normal Gaussian
distributions in color. We find that the CM relations are well fit by a
straight line plus a tanh function. Both relations can be described by a
shallow CM trend (slopes of about -0.04, -0.05) plus a steeper transition in
the average galaxy properties over about two magnitudes. The midpoints of the
transitions (M_r=-19.8 and -20.8 for the red and blue distributions,
respectively) occur around 2x10^10 M_solar after converting luminosities to
stellar mass. Separate luminosity functions are obtained for the two
distributions. The red distribution has a more luminous characteristic
magnitude and a shallower faint-end slope (M^*=-21.5, alpha=-0.8) compared to
the blue distribution (alpha=-1.3 depending on the parameterization). These are
approximately converted to galaxy stellar mass functions. The red distribution
galaxies have a higher number density per magnitude for masses greater than
about 3x10^10 M_solar. Using a simple merger model, we show that the
differences between the two functions are consistent with the red distribution
being formed from major galaxy mergers.

dense star clusters form, and what studies of star clusters have revealed about
galaxy formation and evolution. One important observation is that globular
clusters are observed to form in galaxy mergers and starbursts in the local
universe, which both provides constraints on models of globular cluster
formation, and suggests that similar physical conditions existed when most
early-type galaxies and their globular clusters formed in the past. A second
important observation is that globular cluster systems typically have bimodal
color distributions. This was predicted by merger models, and indicates an
episodic formation history for elliptical galaxies. A third and very recent
result is the discovery of large populations of intermediate age globular
clusters in several elliptical galaxies through the use of optical to
near-infrared colors. These provide an important link between young cluster
systems observed in starbursts and mergers and old cluster systems. This
continuum of ages of the metal-rich globular cluster systems also indicates
that there is no special age or epoch for the formation of the metal-rich
globular clusters, which comprise about half of the cluster population. The
paper concludes with a brief discussion of recent results on the globular
cluster - low-mass X-ray binary connection.

excess apparent acceleration simply results from the transformation of time
between the reference frames of the observer and the star. Although the excess
acceleration averages to zero over a full closed orbit, it could lead to
systematic offsets of a few percent in estimates of the dynamical mass or

turbulent molecular clouds. In this model, clouds, clumps and cores form a
hierarchy of nested density fluctuations caused by the turbulence, and either
collapse or re-expand. Cores that collapse can be either internally sub- or
super-sonic. The former cannot further fragment, and can possibly be associated
with the formation of a single or a few stars. The latter, instead, can undergo
turbulent fragmentation during their collapse, and probably give rise to a
cluster of bound objects. The star formation efficiency is low because only a
small fraction of the density fluctuations proceed to collapse. Those that do
not may constitute a class of ``failed'' cores that can be associated with the
observed starless cores. ``Synthetic'' observations of cores in numerical
simulations of non-magnetic turbulence show that a large fraction of them have
subsonic internal velocity dispersions, can be fitted by Bonnor-Ebert column
density profiles, and exhibit ``coherence'' (an apparent independence of
linewidth with column density near the projected core centers), in agreement

model. This firstly allows to fit simultaneously the data from the UV to the
hard X-ray band in a self-consistent way and secondly it gives direct
constraints on the physical parameters of the disc-corona system. Our results
are completely consistent with a slab geometry where all the observed UV
emission is supposed to cross the corona but more photon-starved geometries
also give acceptable fits. Whatever the geometry is, the UV seed photon
emission appears to be dominated by the reprocessing of the X-rays. We also
found very interesting correlations between the different model parameters, the
most important one being the anticorrelation between the corona temperature and
the UV flux. Such an anticorrelation is clearly inconsistent with a fixed
disc-corona configuration and suggests a variation of the geometry of the
system. We also find a correlation between the corona optical depth and the
X-ray flux which may reflect processes linked to the corona formation. During
the observations, NGC 7469 appears to accrete near its Eddington limit. This
source could then be an example of magnetically dominated disc-corona system as
recently proposed by Merloni (2003).

rho/rho < -0.6 on scales r>7 h^{-1} Mpc from the SDSS. In this paper, we
present the luminosity function of these galaxies and compare it to that of
galaxies at higher densities. We obtain a measurement of the void galaxy
luminosity function over the range -21.5<M_r*<-14.5 in the SDSS r-band. The
void galaxy luminosity function (LF) is well fit by a Schechter function with
values of Phi*=(0.19 +- 0.04)*0.01 h^3 Mpc^{-3}, M_r* - 5logh=-19.74 +- 0.11

+- 0.08 and alpha=-1.19 +- 0.07. The fainter value of M_r* is consistent with
the work of Rojas et al.who found that void galaxies were fainter than galaxies
at higher densities but the value of alpha is very similar to that of galaxies
at higher densities. To investigate this further, the LF of wall and void
galaxies as a function of density is considered. Only the wall galaxies in the
highest density regions have a shallower faint end slope. The LF of the void
galaxies is also compared to the LF of the wall galaxies with similar
properties to the void galaxies. The LF of the bluest, Sersic index n<2 and
EW(Halpha)>5A wall galaxies is very similar in shape to that of the void
galaxies, with only slightly brighter M_r* values and similar values of alpha.
The value of alpha ~ -1.2 found from the void galaxy LF is shallower that that
found from CDM models, suggesting that voids are not filled with a large
population of dwarf galaxies.

very close to $\Gamma-$point, the intensity of neutron scattering peaks

different energy scales by thermal, hot and epithermal neutron scattering

time by an externally applied signal. Making use of a stochastic path integral
approach we obtain general integral equations governing the evolution of
conditional probabilities in the presence of an input signal. These novel
equations generalize earlier integral renewal equations by Cox and others to
the case of driving-induced non-stationarity. On the basis of these new
equations a response theory of two state renewal processes is formulated beyond
the linear response approximation. Moreover, a general expression for the
linear response function is derived. The connection of the developed approach
with the phenomenological theory of linear response for manifest non-Markovian
SR put forward in [ I. Goychuk and P. Hanggi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 070601
(2003)] is clarified and its range of validity is scrutinized. The novel theory
is then applied to SR in symmetric non-Markovian systems and to the class of
single ion channels possessing a fractal kinetics.

tunnelling processes in the PC. These processes reduce the efficiency of the PC
as a qubit readout device, and induce relaxation even when the source-drain

low- and high-bias in which the PC current and current power spectra show
markedly different behaviour. To further illustrate the division between the

anisotropy, and specific finite-size effects. Using phenomenological
(micromagnetic) theory, a comprehensive survey of the magnetic states and
reorientation transitions has been carried out for multilayer systems with even
number of ferromagnetic sub-layers and magnetizations in the plane. In
two-layer systems (N=2) the phase diagrams in dependence on components of the
applied field in the plane include ``swallow-tail'' type regions of
(metastable) multistate co-existence and a number of continuous and
discontinuous reorientation transitions induced by radial and transversal
components of the applied field. In multilayers (N \ge 4) noncollinear states
are spatially inhomogeneous with magnetization varying across the multilayer
stack. For weak four-fold anisotropy the magnetic states under influence of an
applied field evolve by a complex continuous reorientation into the saturated
state. At higher anisotropy they transform into various inhomogeneous and
asymmetric structures. The discontinuous transitions between the magnetic
states in these two-layers and multilayers are characterized by broad ranges of
multi-phase coexistence of the (metastable) states and give rise to specific
transitional domain structures.

with distance from the source. Only beyond a surprisingly large distance, $b

disorder becomes irrelevant for the response of an individual configuration. We
argue that this self-averaging length $b$ sets also the lower wavelength bound

attention is paid to the displacements of the source, allowing a direct
measurement of the local rigidity. The algebraic correlations of these

$\eta_c$, the defects are characterized by a flat worldsheet geometry and
asymptotically flat extra dimensions. The critical scale $\eta_c$ is comparable
to the higher-dimensional Planck scale and has some dependence on the gauge and
scalar couplings. For $\eta=\eta_c$, the extra dimensions degenerate into a
`cigar', and for $\eta>\eta_c$ all static solutions are singular. The
singularity can be removed if the requirement of staticity is relaxed and
defect cores are allowed to inflate. The inflating solutions have de Sitter
worldsheets and cigar geometry in the extra dimensions. Exact analytic
solutions describing the asymptotic behavior of these inflating monopoles are
found and the parameter space of these solutions is analyzed.

means of the so called Nomizu operator representation of covariant derivatives

different embeddings of G inside E8(8). We give some preliminary examples of

oxidation, these solutions provide a smooth and exact realization of the
bouncing phenomenon on Weyl chamber walls envisaged by the cosmological

from non-well-founded properties of the empty set is demonstrated. Space-time
emerges as an ordered sequence of mappings of closed 3-D Poincare sections of a
topological 4-space-time provided by the lattice of primary empty cells. The
fractal kernel stands for a particle and the reduction of its volume is
compensated by morphic changes of a finite number of surrounding cells. Quanta
of distances and quanta of fractality are demonstrated. It is shown that the

of how computation in gene regulation networks can be kept in a

synchronization in the model. Stability under asynchronous dynamics disfavors

decays of charged and neutral pions from a pulsar surrounded by supernova
ejecta in our galaxy, including an effect that has not been taken into
consideration, that is, interactions between high energy cosmic rays themselves

dominant species in the pulsar wind. Bulk flow is assumed to be randomized by
passing through the termination shock and energy distribution functions of
protons and electrons behind the termination shock are assumed to obey the
relativistic Maxwellians. We have found that fluxes of neutrinos and gamma-rays
depend very sensitively on the wind luminosity, which is assumed to be
comparable to the spin-downluminosity. In the case where B=10^{12}G and P=1ms,
neutrinos should be detected by km^3 high-energy neutrino detectors such as
AMANDA and IceCube. Also, gamma-rays should be detected by Cherenkov telescopes
such as CANGAROO and H.E.S.S. as well as by gamma-ray satellites such as GLAST.
On the other hand, in the case where B=10^{12}G and P=5ms, fluxes of neutrinos
and gamma-rays will be too low to be detected even by the next-generation
detectors. However, even in the case where B=10^{12}G and P=5ms, there is a
possibility that very high fluxes of neutrinos may be realized at early stage
of a supernova explosion (t \le 1yr), where the location of the termination
shock is very near to the pulsar. We also found that there is a possibility
that protons with energies \sim 10^5 GeV in the nebula flow may interact with
the photon field from surface of the pulsar and produce much pions, which
enhances the intensity of resulting neutrinos and gamma-rays.

of pixelized gas micro-well detectors to form a three-dimensional electron
track imager. A micro-well detector consists of an array of individual
micro-patterned proportional counters opposite a planar drift electrode. When
combined with thin film transistor array readouts, large gas volumes may be
imaged with very good spatial and energy resolution at reasonable cost. The
third dimension is determined from the drift time of the ionization electrons.
The primary advantage of this approach is the excellent tracking of the Compton
recoil electron that is possible in a gas volume. Such good electron tracking
allows us to reduce the point spread function of a single incident photon
dramatically, greatly improving the imaging capability and sensitivity. The
polarization sensitivity, which relies on events with large Compton scattering
angles, is particularly enhanced. We describe a possible ACT implementation of
this technique, in which the gas tracking volume is surrounded by a CsI
calorimeter, and present our plans to build and test a small prototype over the
next three years.

is rotating 7 times faster than synchronous). We use a Doppler tomography
algorithm to reconstruct the individual primary and secondary spectra in the
region of H-alpha, and we subtract the latter from each of our observations to
obtain profiles of the primary and its disk alone. Our H-alpha observations of
RY Per show that the mass gaining primary is surrounded by a persistent but
time variable accretion disk. The profile that is observed outside-of-eclipse
has weak, double-peaked emission flanking a deep central absorption, and we
find that these properties can be reproduced by a disk model that includes the
absorption of photospheric light by the band of the disk seen in projection
against the face of the star. We developed a new method to reconstruct the disk
surface density distribution from the ensemble of H-alpha profiles observed
around the orbit, and this method accounts for the effects of disk occultation
by the stellar components, the obscuration of the primary by the disk, and flux
contributions from optically thick disk elements. The resulting surface density
distribution is elongated along the axis joining the stars, in the same way as
seen in hydrodynamical simulations of gas flows that strike the mass gainer
near trailing edge of the star. This type of gas stream configuration is
optimal for the transfer of angular momentum, and we show that rapid rotation

of the Compact Steep Spectrum quasar 3C 48. We infer that the X-ray spectrum of
the nucleus is made up of a soft, variable, steep-spectrum component, and
harder, power-law emission of slope consistent with the 1 GHz radio spectrum.
The similarity of 3C 48's X-ray to radio ratio to that seen in core-dominated
radio-loud quasars leads us to examine the possibility that the harder X-ray
emission is inverse Compton radiation from the radio source, which is more than
99% resolved in our VLBA data. The weak (3 sigma) evidence that we find for a
proper motion of 0.5\pm0.2c in a compact radio component about 0.05 arcsec from
the core implies that if this component has a highly relativistic bulk motion,
it is at a very small angle to the line of sight. However, stringent
requirements on the jet opening angle make it unlikely that all the X-ray
emission is from a fast jet which sees boosted Cosmic Microwave Background
emission and emits beamed X-rays in the observer's frame. If the unusual radio
structures are intrinsically one-sided and unbeamed, the inverse Compton
mechanism can provide an appreciable fraction of the X-ray emission if the
magnetic field strength is a factor of six to ten below that which gives equal
energy in radiating relativistic particles and magnetic fields and roughly
minimizes the total energy in the source. It remains possible that the
unresolved X-ray emission arises from close to the central engine, either as an
embedded blazar or associated with the accretion processes. (Slightly
abridged).

demonstrated to be very effective and independent of many of the degeneracies
inherent in previous methods. The magnification ratios of the QSO's narrow line
region (NLR) and broad line region (BLR) are measured and found to be disagree
with each other and with the published radio and mid-infrared magnification
ratios. The disagreement between the BLR ratios and the radio/mid-infrared
ratios is interpreted as microlensing by stars in the lens galaxy of the BLR
The disagreement between the radio/mid-infrared ratios and the NLR ratios is
interpreted as a signature of substructure on a larger scale, possibly the
missing small scale structure predicted by the standard cold dark matter (CDM)
model. Certain combinations of the radial profile and the substructure surface
densities are ruled out using extensive lensing simulations. A substructure
mass scale as large as 10^8 M is strongly disfavored while 10^4 M is too small
if the radio and mid-infrared emission regions have the expected sizes of ~10
pc. The standard elliptical isothermal lens mass profile is not compatible with
a substructure surface density of < 280 M/pc^2 at the 95% confidence level.
This is 4-7% of the galaxy's surface density (depending on which image position
is used to evaluate this). The required substructure surface density at the
required mass scale is high in comparison with the present expectations within
the CDM model.

H_0t_0 = 0.96 +/ 0.04, and Omega_Lambda - 1.4 Omega_M = 0.35 +/- 0.14.
Combining our data with the results of large-scale structure surveys, we find a
best fit for Omega_M and Omega_Lambda of 0.28 and 0.72, respectively --
essentially identical to the recent WMAP results (and having comparable
precision). The sum of the densities, ~1.0, agrees with extensive measurements
of the cosmic microwave background radiation, including WMAP, and coincides
with the value predicted by most inflationary models for the early Universe. A
number of possible systematic effects (dust, SN evolution) thus far do not seem
to eliminate the need for Omega_Lambda > 0. Recently, analyses of SNe Ia at z =
1.0-1.7 provide further support for current acceleration, and give tentative
evidence for an early epoch of deceleration. The dynamical age of the Universe
is 13.1 +/- 1.5 Gyr, consistent with the ages of globular star clusters and
with the WMAP result of 13.7 +/- 0.2 Gyr. Current projects include the search
for additional SNe Ia at z > 1 to confirm the early deceleration, and the
measurement of a few hundred SNe Ia at z = 0.2-0.8 to determine the equation of

both theorists and experimentalists in condensed matter physics. These
transitions, which are accessed at zero temperature by variation of a
non-thermal control parameter, can influence the behavior of electronic systems
over a wide range of the phase diagram. Quantum phase transitions occur as a
result of competing ground state phases. The cuprate superconductors which can
be tuned from a Mott insulating to a d-wave superconducting phase by carrier
doping are a paradigmatic example. This review introduces important concepts of
phase transitions and discusses the interplay of quantum and classical
fluctuations near criticality. The main part of the article is devoted to bulk
quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems. Several classes of
transitions will be briefly reviewed, pointing out, e.g., conceptual
differences between ordering transitions in metallic and insulating systems. An
interesting separate class of transitions are boundary phase transitions where
only degrees of freedom of a subsystem become critical; this will be
illustrated in a few examples. The article is aimed on bridging the gap between
high-level theoretical presentations and research papers specialized in certain
classes of materials. It will give an overview over a variety of different
quantum transitions, critically discuss open theoretical questions, and
frequently make contact with recent experiments in condensed matter physics.

dimensional one-component system of spherical particles interacting via a
discontinuous potential combining a repulsive square soft core and an
attractive square well. In the case of a narrow attractive well, it has been
shown that this potential has two metastable gas-liquid critical points. Here
we systematically investigate how the changes of the parameters of this
potential affect the phase diagram of the system. We find a broad range of
potential parameters for which the system has both a gas-liquid critical point
and a liquid-liquid critical point. For the liquid-gas critical point we find
that the derivatives of the critical temperature and pressure, with respect to
the parameters of the potential, have the same signs: they are positive for
increasing width of the attractive well and negative for increasing width and
repulsive energy of the soft core. This result resembles the behavior of the
liquid-gas critical point for standard liquids. In contrast, for the
liquid-liquid critical point the critical pressure decreases as the critical
temperature increases. As a consequence, the liquid-liquid critical point
exists at positive pressures only in a finite range of parameters. We present a
modified van der Waals equation which qualitatively reproduces the behavior of
both critical points within some range of parameters, and give us insight on
the mechanisms ruling the dependence of the two critical points on the
potential's parameters. The soft core potential studied here resembles model
potentials used for colloids, proteins, and potentials that have been related
to liquid metals, raising an interesting possibility that a liquid-liquid phase

the spin flop phase the system prefers a commensurate magnetic order, at low
doping, whereas at larger doping the incommensurate phase is favorable.
Contrary to the pure Heisenberg case, the spin flop region does not span an
infinite area in the ('Delta',h) plane, where 'Delta' is the exchange
anisotropy and h is the external magnetic field. We characterize the magnetic
and charge-transport properties of the spin-flop phase, computing the magnetic
susceptibility and the Drude weight. This latter quantity presents a sudden
variation as the spin-flop to paramagnet phase transition line is crossed. This
effect could be used as a possible source of large magneto-resistance. Our

projector is proven: There exists only one projector which transforms the
arbitrary vector field equipped with the given Lyapunov function into a vector
field with the same Lyapunov function for a given anzatz manifold which is not
tangent to the Lyapunov function levels. Moreover, from the requirement of
persistence of the {\it sign} of dissipation follows that the {\it value} of
dissipation (the entropy production) persists too. The explicit construction of
this {\it thermodynamic projector} is described. Second, we use this projector
for developing the short memory approximation and coarse-graining for general
nonlinear dynamic systems. We prove that in this approximation the entropy
production grows. ({\it The theorem about entropy overproduction.}) In example
we apply the thermodynamic projector to derivation the equations of reduced
kinetics for the Fokker-Planck equation. The new class of closures is
developed: The kinetic multipeak polyhedrons. Distributions of this type are
expected to appear in each kinetic model with multidimensional instability as
universally, as Gaussian distribution appears for stable systems. The number of
possible relatively stable states of nonequilibrium system grows as $2^m$, and
the number of macroscopic parameters is in order $mn$, where $n$ is the
dimension of configuration space, and $m$ is the number of independent unstable
directions in this space. The elaborated class of closures and equations

for small m_K, we find no S=+1 kaon bound states or resonances in the spectrum,
confirming previous work. This suggests that, at least for large N and small
m_K, the exotic state may be an artifact of the rigid rotator approach to the
Skyrme model. An S=+1 near-threshold state comes into existence only for
sufficiently large SU(3) breaking. If such a state exists, then it has the
expected quantum numbers of Theta+: I=0, J=1/2 and positive parity. Other

theory on noncommutative spacetime. Since the deviation from the standard model
in particle physics has not yet observed, and so there may be no room to
incorporate the noncommutative U(1) gauge theory into the standard model
because the quarks have fractional charges. However, it is shown in this
article that there is the noncommutative gauge theory with arbitrary charges
which symmetry is for example SU(3+1)$\ast$. This enveloping gauge group
consists of elements $\exp i {\sum_{a=0}^8 T^a \alpha^a(x,\theta)\ast+ Q
\beta(x,\theta)\ast} $ with $Q=\text{diag}(e,e,e,e') $ and the restriction
$\lim_{\theta\to0}\alpha^0(x,\theta)=0.$ This type of gauge theory is emergent
from the spontaneous breakdown of the noncommutative SU(N)$\ast$ or SO(N)$\ast$
gauge theory in which the gauge field contains the 0 component
$A_\mu^0(x,\theta)$. $A_\mu^0(x,\theta)$ can be eliminated by gauge
transformation. Thus, the noncommutative gauge theory with arbitrary U(1)
charges can not exist alone, but it must coexist with noncommutative nonabelian
gauge theory. This suggests that the spacetime noncommutativity requires the
grand unified theory which spontaneously breaks down to the noncommutative
standard model with fractionally charged quarks.

and infinity, and the branching over 0 and infinity specified by partitions of
the degree (with m and n parts respectively). Single Hurwitz numbers have a
rich structure, explored by authors in many fields. The ELSV formula relates
single Hurwitz numbers to intersection theory on the moduli space of curves,
and has led to many consequences.
  We determine the structure of double Hurwitz numbers using geometry, algebra,
and representation theory. Our motivation is geometric: we give strong evidence
that double Hurwitz numbers are top intersections on a universal Picard
variety. In particular, we prove a piecewise-polynomiality result analogous to
that implied by the ELSV formula. In the case m=1 and n is arbitrary, we
conjecture an ELSV-type formula, and show it to be true in genus 0 and 1. The
corresponding Witten-type correlation function has a better structure than that
for single Hurwitz numbers, and it satisfies many geometric properties, such as
the string and dilaton equations, and a genus expansion ansatz analogous to
that of Itzykson and Zuber. We give a symmetric function description of the
double Hurwitz generating series, which leads to explicit formulae for double
Hurwitz numbers with given m and n. In the case where m is fixed but not
necessarily 1, we prove a topological recursion on the corresponding generating
series, which leads to closed-form expressions for double Hurwitz numbers and
an analogue of the Goulden-Jackson polynomiality conjecture (an early

Riemann-Hilbert problems. As a corollary, asymptotic zero behavior is derived.
We show that in a generic case the zeros distribute on the set of critical

$\alpha_n$, $\beta_n$ or $\alpha_n+\beta_n$ are geometrically close to $\Z$,

starting from microscopic chaos in the equations of motion of a many-particle
system. In this review we summarize recent theoretical advances along these
lines. Particularly, we are concerned with nonequilibrium situations created by
external electric fields and by temperature or velocity gradients. These
constraints pump energy into a system, hence there must be some thermal
reservoir that prevents the system from heating up. About twenty years ago a
deterministic and time-reversible modeling of such thermal reservoirs was
proposed in form of Gaussian and Nose-Hoover thermostats. This approach yielded
simple relations between fundamental quantities of nonequilibrium statistical
mechanics and of dynamical systems theory. The main theme of our review is to
critically assess the universality of these results. As a vehicle of
demonstration we employ the driven periodic Lorentz gas, which is a toy model
for the classical dynamics of an electron in a metal under application of an
electric field. Applying different types of thermal reservoirs to this system
we compare the resulting nonequilibrium steady states with each other. Along
the same lines we discuss an interacting many-particle system under shear and
heat. Finally, we outline an unexpected relationship between deterministic
thermostats and active Brownian particles modeling biophysical cell motility.

an important prerequisite towards finding potential drug targets, and
ultimately a cure. We introduce here a modelling framework based on a key
analogy of the physico-chemical properties of the exon1 fragment to block
copolymers. We use a systematic mesoscale methodology, based on Dissipative
Particle Dynamics, which is capable of overcoming kinetic barriers, thus
capturing the dynamics of significantly larger systems over longer times than
considered before. Our results reveal that the relative hydrophobicity of the
poly-glutamine block as compared to the rest of the (proline-based) exon1
fragment, ignored to date, constitutes a major factor in the initiation of the
self-assembly process. We find that the assembly is governed by both the
concentration of exon1 and the length of the poly-glutamine stretch, with a low
length threshold for association even at the lowest volume fractions we
considered. Moreover, this self-association occurs irrespective of whether the
glutamine stretch is in random coil or hairpin configuration, leading to
spherical or cylindrical assemblies, respectively. We discuss the implications
of these results for reinterpretation of existing research within this context,
including that the routes towards aggregation of exon1 may be distinct to those

electrodynamics that allow one atom to be isolated in an optical cavity in a
regime for which one photon is sufficient to saturate the atomic transition. In
this regime the observed characteristics of the atom-cavity system are
qualitatively different from those of the familiar many atom case.
Specifically, we present measurements of intracavity photon number versus pump

020813 optical afterglow carried out in three nights, from 0.88 to 4.20 days
after the gamma-ray event. The mean values of the degree of linear polarization
(P) and its position angle (Theta) resulting from our campaign are
<P>=1.18+/-0.10% and Theta = 148.7+/-2.3 deg after correcting for Galactic
interstellar polarization. Our VLT data set is most naturally described by a
constant degree of linear polarization and position angle, nonetheless a slow
Theta evolution cannot be entirely ruled out by our data. The VLT monitoring
campaign did not reveal either a significant Theta rotation respect to the Keck
spectropolarimetric observations performed ~0.25 days after the GRB (Barth et
al. 2003). However, <P> is a factor of two lower than the polarization degree
measured from Keck. Additionally, the VLT polarization data allowed us to
construct an accurate V-band light curve. The V-band photometric data revealed
a smooth light curve with a break located between the last Keck and our first
VLT polarimetric measurement, 0.33 < t_(break, V) < 0.88 days after the GRB.
The typical magnitude fluctuations of the VLT V-band lightcurve are 0.003 mag,
0.010 mag and 0.016 mag for our three observing nights, respectively. We
speculate that the stability of Theta might be related to the smoothness of the
light curve.

interference contribution renormalizes both the quantum pump effect and the ac
rectification effect. Analysis of this interference effect requires a
calculation of the Floquet scattering matrix beyond the adiabatic approximation

finiteness equations are solvable thanks to the following properties: the beta
functions of the irrelevant couplings have a simple structure; the irrelevant
terms made with the Riemann tensor can be reabsorbed by means of field
redefinitions; the other irrelevant terms have, generically, non-vanishing
anomalous dimensions. The perturbative expansion is governed by an effective
Planck mass that takes care of the interactions in the matter sector. As an
example, I study gravity coupled with Chern-Simons U(1) gauge theory with
massless fermions, solve the finiteness equations and determine the
four-fermion couplings to two-loop order. The construction of this paper does
not immediately apply to four-dimensional quantum gravity.

irrelevant deformations of interacting conformal field theories. The
deformations are finite or have a unique running scale (""quasi-finite""). They
are made of an infinite number of lagrangian terms and a finite number of
independent parameters that renormalize coherently. The coefficients of the
irrelevant terms are determined imposing that the beta functions of the
dimensionless combinations of couplings vanish (""quasi-finiteness equations"").
The expansion in powers of the energy is meaningful for energies much smaller
than an effective Planck mass. Multiple deformations can be considered also. I
study the general conditions to have non-trivial solutions. As an example, I
construct the Pauli deformation of the IR fixed point of massless non-Abelian
Yang-Mills theory with N_c colors and N_f <~ 11N_c/2 flavors and compute the
couplings of the term F^3 and the four-fermion vertices. Another interesting
application is the construction of finite chiral irrelevant deformations of N=2
and N=4 superconformal field theories. The results of this paper suggest that
power-counting non-renormalizable theories might play a role in the description
of fundamental physics.

for two non-supersymmetric theories which are orientifold daughters of
supersymmetric gluodynamics (containing one Dirac fermion in the two-index
antisymmetric or symmetric representation of the gauge group). Since the parent
and daughter theories are planar equivalent, at N\to\infty the effective
Lagrangians in the orientifold theories basically coincide with the bosonic
part of the VY Lagrangian.
  We depart from the supersymmetric limit in two ways. First, we consider
finite (albeit large) values of N. Then 1/N effects break supersymmetry. We
suggest seemingly the simplest modification of the VY Lagrangian which
incorporates these 1/N effects, leading to a non-vanishing vacuum energy
density. We analyze the spectrum of the finite-N non-supersymmetric daughters.
For N=3 the two-index antisymmetric representation (one flavor) is equivalent
to one-flavor QCD. We show that in this case the scalar quark-antiquark state
is heavier than the corresponding pseudoscalar state, `` eta' ''. Second, we
add a small fermion mass term. The fermion mass term breaks supersymmetry
explicitly. The vacuum degeneracy is lifted. The parity doublets split. We
evaluate the splitting. Finally, we include the theta-angle and study its
implications.

crystals with a regular space modulation of the sign of nonlinear coupling
coefficient of interacting waves is developed. By applying the matrix method,
the theory is based on a step-by-step approach. It is shown that, in the case
where the pumping intensity is less than some critical value, the spatial
dynamics of the signal intensity inside a separate layer with the constant
nonlinear coefficient has an oscillatory behavior and the change of the signal
intensity from layer to layer is defined, in general, by the power function.
The same law is valid for the change of variance of signal's quadrature
components. At large number of layers, these dependences can be reduced to the
well-known ones for homogeneous nonlinear optical crystals.

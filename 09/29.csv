  Freeman",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The $\Lambda$CDM scenario to form galaxies encounters many problems when
confronted with observations, namely the prediction of dark matter cusps in all
galaxies, and in particular in dwarf irregulars, dominated by dark matter, or
the low angular momentum and consequent small size of galaxy disks, or the high
predicted number of small systems. We will consider the hypothesis that the
baryonic dark matter could be in the form of gas and could be continuously
involved in the galaxy formation scenario. Through cold gas accretion all along
a galaxy life, angular momentum could be increased, galaxy disks could be more
dominated by baryons than previously thought, and small systems could merge
more frequently.

density to energy density gives exactly the Friedmann equation of general
relativity. Accounting for work done by pressure then yields the two Einstein
equations that govern the expansion of the universe. Descriptions and
explanations of radiation pressure and vacuum pressure are added to complete a
basic kit of cosmology tools. It provides a basis for teaching cosmology to
undergraduates in a way that quickly equips them to do basic calculations. This
is demonstrated with calculations involving: characteristics of the expansion
for densities dominated by radiation, matter, or vacuum; the closeness of the
density to the critical density; how much vacuum energy compared to matter
energy is needed to make the expansion accelerate; and how little is needed to
make it stop. Travel time and luninosity distance are calculated in terms of
the redshift and the densities of matter and vacuum energy, using a scaled
Friedmann equation with the constant in the curvature term determined by
matching with the present values of the Hubble parameter and energy density.
General relativity is needed only for the luminosity distance, to describe how
the curvature of space, determined by the energy density, can change the
intensity of light by changing the area of the sphere to which the light has
spread. Thirty-one problems are included.

correction for the instrumental point spread function. We use the results of
this analysis to compare the luminosities and sizes of nuclear star clusters to
those of other ellipsoidal stellar systems, in particular the Milky Way
globular clusters. Our nuclear clusters have a median effective radius of r_e =
3.5 pc, with 50% of the sample falling between 2.4 pc < r_e < 5.0 pc. This
narrow size distribution is statistically indistinguishable from that of
Galactic globular clusters, even though the nuclear clusters are on average 4
magnitudes brighter than the old globulars. We discuss some possible
interpretations of this result. From a comparison of nuclear cluster
luminosities with various properties of their host galaxies, we confirm that
more luminous galaxies harbor more luminous nuclear clusters. It remains
unclear whether this correlation mainly reflects the influence of galaxy size,
mass, and/or star formation rate. Since the brighter galaxies in our sample
typically have stellar disks with a higher central surface brightness, nuclear
cluster luminosity also correlates with this property of their hosts. On the
other hand, we find no evidence for a correlation between the presence of a
nuclear star cluster and the presence of a large-scale stellar bar.

XMM-Newton of a sample of 17 cooling clusters and three non-cooling clusters
for comparison. The deprojected spectra are analyzed with a multi-temperature
model, independent of any a priori assumptions about the physics behind the
cooling and heating mechanisms. All cooling clusters show a central decrement
of the average temperature, most of them of a factor of ~2. At each radius
within the cooling region the gas is non-isothermal. The differential emission
measure distribution peaks near the maximum (ambient) temperature, and steeply
declines towards lower temperatures, proportional to T^3, or alternatively a
cut-off at about a quarter to half of the maximum temperature. In general, we
find a poor correlation between radio flux of the central galaxy and the
temperature decrement of the cooling flow. This is interpreted as evidence that
except for a few cases heating by a central AGN is not the most common cause of
weak cooling flows. We investigate the role of heat conduction by electrons and
find that the theoretically predicted conductivity rates are not high enough to
balance radiation losses. The differential emission measure distribution has
remarkable similarities with the predictions from coronal magnetic loop models.
Also the physical processes involved (radiative cooling, thermal conduction
along the loops, gravity) are similar for clusters loops and coronal loops. If
coronal loop models apply to clusters, we find that a few hundred loops per
scale height should be present. The typical loop sizes deduced from the
observed emission measure distribution are consistent with the characteristic
magnetic field sizes deduced from Faraday rotation measurements.

$\Omega$ is increased, the oscillation frequency $\omega$ of the $r$-modes in
the thin envelopes deviates appreciably from the asymptotic frequency
$\omega=2m\Omega/l^\prime(l^\prime+1)$ defined in the limit of $\Omega\to 0$,
where $\omega$ is the frequency observed in the corotating frame of the star,
and $m$ and $l^\prime$ are the indices of the spherical harmonic function
$Y_{l^\prime}^m$ representing the angular dependence of the modes. We find that
the fundamental $r$-modes in the convective models are destabilized by strong
nuclear burning in the convective region. Because of excessive heating by
nuclear buring, the corotating-frame oscillation frequency $\omega$ of the
$r$-modes in the convective models becomes larger, and hence the inertial-frame
oscillation frequency $|\sigma|$ becomes smaller, than those of the
corresopnding $r$-modes in the radiative models, where $\sigma=\omega-m\Omega$
is negative for the $r$-modes of positive $m$. We find that the relative

ratio observed in the HII regions (all uncertainties are 2-sigma). If the
oxygen is depleted in the HI region compared to the HII regions, the depletion

single-dish HCN spectra, we argue that the present mass-loss rate is low, ~2 x
10^{-7} Msol/yr, supporting the idea that R Scl had to experience a brief
episode of intense mass loss in order to produce the detached CO shell at ~10
arcsec radius inferred from single-dish observations. Detailed radiative
transfer modelling yields an abundance of HCN relative to H_2, of ~10^{-5} in
the present-day wind. There appears to be a discrepancy between model results
obtained with higher transition single-dish data included and those from the
J=1-0 interferometer data alone, in that the interferometer data suggest a
smaller envelope size and larger HCN abundance than the single-dish data. The
lack of HCN in the detached shell is consistent with the rapid
photodissociation of HCN into CN as it expands away from the star.

quiescence. Thanks to XMM-Newton large throughput, Cen X-4 was observed at the
highest signal to noise ever. This allowed us to disclose rapid (>100 s), large
(45+/-7 rms in the 10^{-4}-1 Hz range) intensity variability, especially at low
energies. In order to highlight the cause of this variability, we divided the
data into intensity intervals and fit the resulting spectra with the canonical
model for neutron star transients in quiescence, i.e. an absorbed power law
plus a neutron star atmosphere. The fit is consistent with a variable column
density plus variability in (at least) one of the spectral models. Variations
in the neutron star atmosphere might suggest that accretion onto the neutron
star surface is occuring in quiescence; variations in the power law tail should
support the view of an active millisecond radio pulsar emitting X-rays at the
shock between a radio pulsar wind and inflowing matter from the companion star.

Accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics","Astron.Astrophys.413:981-991,2004","10.1051/0004-6361:20031525",,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate the dust composition of detached shells around carbon stars,
with a focus to understand the origin of the cool magnesium-sulfide (MgS)
material around warm carbon stars, which has been detected around several of
these objects. We build a radiative transfer model of a carbon star surrounded
by an expanding detached shell of dust. The shell contains amorphous carbon
grains and MgS grains. We find that a small fraction of MgS dust (2% of the
dust mass) can give a significant contribution to the IRAS 25 micron flux.
However, the presence of MgS in the detached shell cannot be inferred from the
IRAS broadband photometry alone but requires infrared spectroscopy. We apply
the model to the detached-shell sources R Scl and U Cam, both exhibiting a cool
MgS feature in their ISO/SWS spectra. We use the shell parameters derived for
the molecular shell, using the CO submillimetre maps. The models, with MgS
grains located in the detached shell, explain the MgS grain temperature, as
derived from their ISO spectra, very well. This demonstrates that the MgS
grains are located at the distance of the detached shell, which is a direct
indication that these shells originate from a time when the stellar photosphere
was already carbon-rich. In the case of R Scl, the IRAS photometry is
simultaneously explained by the single shell model. In the case of U Cam, the
IRAS photometry is under predicted, pointing to a contribution from cooler dust
located even further away from the star than the molecular shell. We present a
simple diagnostic to constrain the distance of the shell using the profile of
the MgS emission feature. The emission feature shifts to longer wavelength with
decreasing grain temperature. One can therefore infer a temperature and a
corresponding distance to the star from the observed profile. (abridged)

ones, is that they host the large majority of the known extrasolar planets.

understanding the physics of brown dwarfs and giant planets. We have measured

objects located in the disk-halo interface of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC55.
Their spectra reveal continuum emission from stars and show typical
emission-lines as observed in ordinary disk HII-regions. Similar to the Diffuse
Ionized Gas (DIG) the prominent ionization stage of oxygen is O+, whereas the
corresponding one for low metallicity HII-regions is O++. A comparison with
CLOUDY model simulations reveals that the ionization mechanism of these compact
objects is most likely photoionization by late OB stars (O9.5 to B0). Further
analysis of diagnostic diagrams unambiguously confirms the HII-region
character. This raises the question whether these extraplanar HII-regions
(EHRs) originated from the prominent extraplanar gas of this galaxy or have
just been expelled from the disk into the halo. From hydrodynamical
considerations ejection from the disk can be ruled out. Therefore, these
objects must have formed within the halo. Compared to the average abundance of
the central disk HII-region (45% Z_solar) both EHRs reveal substantially lower
[O/H] abundances of about 10% Z_solar. We could establish for the first time
strong differences in the metal content along the minor axis of this galaxy.
Oxygen appears to be less abundant in the halo by about a factor of 4. Since
both EHRs are located above the central part of NGC55, it appears likely, that
their formation was triggered by star formation activity in the disk below. In
this environment the molecular gas clouds out of which EHRs have formed can
survive and collapse only in the period between two successive bursts of star
formation.

semiconservative nature of DNA replication. We solve the equations in the limit
of infinite sequence length for the simplest case of a static, sharply peaked
fitness landscape. We show that the error catastrophe occurs when $ \mu $, the
product of sequence length and per base pair mismatch probability, exceeds $ 2
\ln \frac{2}{1 + 1/k} $, where $ k > 1 $ is the first order growth rate
constant of the viable ``master'' sequence (with all other sequences having a
first-order growth rate constant of $ 1 $). This is in contrast to the result
of $ \ln k $ for conservative replication. In particular, as $ k \to \infty $,
the error catastrophe is never reached for conservative replication, while for
semiconservative replication the critical $ \mu $ approaches $ 2 \ln 2 $.
Semiconservative replication is therefore considerably less robust than
conservative replication to the effect of replication errors. We also show that
the mean equilibrium fitness of a semiconservatively replicating system is
given by $ k (2 e^{-\mu/2} - 1) $ below the error catastrophe, in contrast to
the standard result of $ k e^{-\mu} $ for conservative replication (derived by

Langmuir-Hinshelwood-like A + B \to 0 reactions in systems in which a catalytic
plane (CP) is in contact with liquid phase, containg concentrations of reactive
particles. Such BME result from repeated particles desorption from the CP,
subsequent diffusion in the liquid phase and eventual readsorption on the CP
away from the intial detachment point. This process which leads to an effective
superdiffusive transport along the CP. We consider both ""batch"" reactions, in
which all particles of reactive species were initially adsorbed onto the CP,
and reactions followed by a steady inflow of particles onto the CP. We show
that for ""batch"" reactions the BME provide an effective mixing channel and here
the mean-field-type behavior emerges. On contrary, for reaction followed by a
steady inflow of particles, we observe essential departures from the mean-field
behavior and find that the mixing effect of the BME is insufficient to restore
chemical equilibrium. We show that a steady-state is established as t \to
\infty, in which the limiting value of the mean coverages of the CP depends on
the particles' diffusion coefficient in the bulk liquid phase and the spatial
distributions of adsorbed particles are strongly correlated. Moreover, we show
that the relaxation to such a steady-state is described by a power-law function
of time, in contrast to the exponential time-dependence describing the approach
to equilibrium in perfectly stirred systems.

negative values of $d\ln T_c/d\ln V$ ($V$ is the volume) in lanthanum ceramics,
small values of the jump in the electron heat capacity at $T=T_c$, negative
curvature of the upper critical magnetic field $H_{c2}$ near the transition

disordering of oxygen increases, and also as copper atoms are replaced by a
nonmagnetic impurity (Al, Zn, etc.). The main mechanism responsible for this
decrease is the interband scattering of electrons by impurities and by randomly
distributed oxygen vacancies. A theory has been developed of multiband

also in the dependence of $T_c$ on $x$ for $La_{2-x}(Ba,Sr)_xCuO_4$, that has

second property (which has a geometric origin) can be exploited to build these

suppressed by arranging a large triplet mass. Here we explore instead a
mechanism for suppressing the couplings of the triplets to the first and second
generations compared to the Yukawa couplings, so that the triplets' mass can be
below the GUT scale. This mechanism is based on a ``triplet symmetry'' in the
context of product-group GUTs. We study two possibilities. One, which requires
the top Yukawa to arise from a non-renormalizable operator at the GUT scale, is
that all triplet couplings to matter are negligible, so that the triplets can
be at the weak scale. The second is that some triplet couplings, and in
particular $T t b$ and $T \bar{t} \bar{l}$, are equal to the corresponding
Yukawa couplings. This would give a distinct signature of grand unification if
the triplets were sufficiently light. However, we derive a model-independent
bound on the triplet mass in this case, which is at least 10$^6$GeV. Finally,
we construct a GUT model based on Yukawa splitting, with the triplets at
10$^{14}$GeV, as required for coupling unification to work.

using the double-arm time-of-flight spectrometer CORSET. The MEDs of fragments
for heated fission were shown to consist of two components. One component,
which is due to classical fusion-fission, is associated with the symmetric
fission of the 256No compound nucleus. The other component, which appears as
''shoulders'', is associated with the quasi-fission process and can be named
''quasi-fission shoulders''. Those quasi-fission shoulders enclose light
fragments whose masses are 60-90 a.m.u. The total kinetic energy (TKE) of the
fragments that belong to the shoulders is higher than the value expected for a
classical fusion-fission process. We have come to the conclusion that in
quasi-fission, spherical shells with Z=28 and N=50 play a great role. It has
also been demonstrated that the properties of the MEDs of fragments formally
agree with a well-known hypothesis of two independent fission modes; in this
case the modes are normal fusion-fission and quasi-fission processes. A
high-energetic Super-Short mode of classical fission has been found at low
excitation energies in the mass range of heavy fragments M = 130-135 and TKE =
233 MeV; however the yield associated with this mode is small.

potential. This has been realized with cold atoms in a one-dimensional
dissipative optical lattice. The stochastic process of optical pumping leads to
a diffusive dynamics of the atoms through the periodic structure, while a
zero-mean force which breaks the temporal symmetry of the system is applied by
phase-modulating one of the lattice beams. The atoms are set into directed
motion as a result of the breaking of the temporal symmetry of the system.

atomic velocity in Sisyphus cooling. The relaxation rates of the atomic kinetic
temperature are determined for a 3D lin$\perp$lin optical lattice. We find that
the damping rates of the atomic temperature depend linearly on the optical
pumping rate, for a given depth of the potential wells. This is at variance
with the behavior of the friction coefficient as calculated from the spatial
diffusion coefficients within a model of Brownian motion. The origin of this
different behavior is identified by distinguishing the role of the trapped and
traveling atoms.

  lattices: Evidence for a stochastic resonance",,"Phys. Rev. A 68 (2003) 023404","10.1103/PhysRevA.68.023404",,"quant-ph",,"  We theoretically study the influence of the noise strength on the excitation
of the Brillouin propagation modes in a dissipative optical lattice. We show
that the excitation has a resonant behavior for a specific amount of noise
corresponding to the precise synchronization of the Hamiltonian motion on the
optical potential surfaces and the dissipative effects associated with optical
pumping in the lattice. This corresponds to the phenomenon of stochastic
resonance. Our results are obtained by numerical simulations and correspond to
the analysis of microscopic quantities (atomic spatial distributions) as well
as macroscopic quantities (enhancement of spatial diffusion and pump-probe
spectra). We also present a simple analytical model in excellent agreement with
the simulations.

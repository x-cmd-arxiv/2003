5.54s pulsar discovered by Ibrahim et al. (2003) in recent RXTE observations.
In a set of short exposures with the Chandra HRC camera we detect a strongly
modulated signal (55+/-4% pulsed fraction) with the expected period located at
(J2000) 18:09:51.08, -19:43:51.7, with a uncertainty radius of 0.6 arcsec (90%
C.L.). Spectra obtained with XMM-Newton are well fitted by a two-component
model that typically describes anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), an absorbed
blackbody plus power law with parameters kT = 0.67+/-0.01 keV, Gamma=3.7+/-0.2,
N_H=(1.05+/-0.05)E22 cm^-2, and Fx(0.5-10 keV) = 3.98E-11 ergs/cm2/s.
Alternatively, a 2T blackbody fit is just as acceptable. The location of CXOU
J180951.1-194351 is consistent with a point source seen in archival Einstein,
Rosat, & ASCA images, when its flux was nearly two orders-of-magnitude fainter,
and from which no pulsations are found. The spectrum changed dramatically
between the ""quiescent"" and ""active"" states, the former can be modeled as a
softer blackbody. Using XMM timing data, we place an upper limit of 0.03 lt-s
on any orbital motion in the period range 10m-8hr. Optical and infrared images
obtained on the SMARTS 1.3m telescope at CTIO show no object in the Chandra
error circle to limits V=22.5, I=21.3, J=18.9, & K=17.5. Together, these

similar to the transient AXP AX J1844.8-0256. Continuing study of XTE J1810-197

of the outer convective zones which vary by more than one order of magnitude
among the considered stars while the observed overabundances of metals are
similar. We show here that in previous discussions a fundamental process was
forgotten : thermohaline convection induced by the inverse mu-gradient.
""Metallic fingers"" may be created which dilute the accreted matter inside the
star. Introducing this effect may reconcile the overabundances expected in case
of accretion with the observations in stars of different masses.

roughly constant at \Delta [Fe/H] ~ 0.8 dex for early-type galaxies spanning a
luminosity range of roughly four orders of magnitude. We combine the globular
cluster metallicity distributions with an empirical technique described in a
series of earlier papers to investigate the form of the protogalactic mass
spectrum in these cD galaxies. We find that the observed GC metallicity
distributions are consistent with those expected if cD galaxies form through
the cannibalism of numerous galaxies and protogalactic fragments which formed
their stars and globular clusters before capture and disruption. However, the
properties of their GC systems suggest that dynamical friction is not the
primary mechanism by which these galaxies are assembled. We argue that cDs
instead form rapidly, via hierarchical merging, prior to cluster virialization.

of the Universe and SN Ia progenitor models. Given some of the recent
determinations of the SFH, the observed SN Ia redshift distribution indicates a
long (>~1 h^-1 Gyr) mean delay time between the formation of a stellar
population and the explosion of some of its members as SNe Ia. For example, if
the Madau et al. (1998) SFH is assumed, the delay time tau is constrained to be
tau > 1.7 (tau > 0.7) h^-1 Gyr at the 95%(99%) confidence level (CL). SFHs that
rise at high redshift, similar to those advocated by Lanzetta et al. (2002),
are inconsistent with the data at the 95% CL unless tau > 2.5 h^-1 Gyr. Long
time delays disfavor progenitor models such as edge-lit detonation of a white
dwarf accreting from a giant donor, and the carbon core ignition of a white
dwarf passing the Chandrasekhar mass due to accretion from a subgiant. The SN
Ia delay may be shorter, thereby relaxing some of these constraints, if the
field star formation rate falls, between z=1 and the present, less sharply than
implied, e.g., by the original Madau plot. We show that the discovery of larger
samples of high-z SNe Ia by forthcoming observational projects should yield
strong constraints on the progenitor models and the SFH. In a companion paper
(astro-ph/0309797), we demonstrate that if SNe Ia produce most of the iron in
galaxy clusters, and the stars in clusters formed at z~2, the SN Ia delay time
must be lower than 2 Gyr. If so, then the Lanzetta et al. (2002) SFH will be

predict different ``delay functions'' between the formation of a stellar
population and the explosion of some of its members as SNe Ia. We use our
previous measurements of the cluster SN Ia rate at high redshift to constrain
SN Ia progenitor models and the star-formation epoch in clusters. The low
observed rate of cluster SNe Ia at z ~ 0 - 1 means that, if SNe Ia produced the
observed amount of iron, they must have exploded at even higher z. This puts a

in temporal properties (sudden increase or decrease in the rms amplitude of
variability) are much sharper than the changes in the spectral properties, and
it is much easier to identify a state transition with the temporal properties.
  The spectral index shows a drop 3-5 days before the transition for some of
our sources. The ratio of the power-law flux to the total flux in the 3-25 keV
band increases close to the transition, which may mean that the system must be
dominated by the coronal emission for the transition to occur. We also show
that the power-law flux shows a sharp change along with the temporal properties
during the transitions which may indicate a threshold transition volume for the
corona. The evolution of the spectral and temporal properties after the
transition is consistent with the idea that the inner accretion disk moves away
from the black hole. Based on the evolution of spectral and temporal parameters

understanding the rapid neutron-capture process (i.e., the r-process). These
advances include large quantities of high-resolution spectroscopic abundance
data of neutron-capture elements, improved astrophysical models, and
increasingly more precise nuclear and atomic physics data. The elemental
abundances of the heavy neutron-capture elements, from Ba through the third
r-process peak, in low-metallicity ([Fe/H] <~ -2.5) Galactic halo stars are
consistent with the scaled (i.e., relative) solar system r-process abundance
distribution. These abundance comparisons suggest that for elements with Z >=
56 the r-process is robust--appearing to operate in a relatively consistent
manner over the history of the Galaxy--and place stringent constraints on
r-process models. While not yet identified, neutron-rich ejecta outside of the
core in a collapsing (Type II, Ib) supernova continues to be a promising site
for the r-process. Neutron star binary mergers might also be a possible
alternative site. Abundance comparisons of lighter n-capture elements in halo
stars show variations with the scaled solar r-process curve and might suggest
either multiple r-process sites, or, at least, different synthesis conditions
in the same astrophysical site. Constraints on r-process models and clues to
the progenitors of the halo stars--the earliest generations of Galactic
stars--are also provided by the star-to-star abundance scatter of [Eu/Fe] at
low metallicities in the early Galaxy. Finally, abundance observations of
long-lived radioactive elements (such as Th and U) produced in the r-process
can be used to determine the chronometric ages of the oldest stars, placing
constraints on the lower limit age estimates of the Galaxy and the Universe.

analytical and numerical estimates of the ejection velocity in the case of a
debris disk interacting with a Jupiter mass planet. We provide rough estimates
of the flux of large micrometeoroids from all three classes of sources. Current
radar systems are unlikely to detect significant numbers of meteors from debris
disks such as Beta Pictoris. However, we suggest improvements to radar systems
that should allow for the detection of multiple examples of all three classes.

constraints from simulated angular diameter distance measurements based on the

galaxy NGC4649. In addition to bright diffuse emission, we resolve 165 discrete
sources, most of which are presumably low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). As found
in previous studies, the luminosity function of the resolved sources is
well-fit by a broken power-law. In NGC4697 and NGC1553, the break luminosity
was comparable to the Eddington luminosity of a $1.4 M_{\odot}$ neutron star.
One possible interpretation of this result is that those sources with
luminosities above the break are accreting black holes and those below are
mainly accreting neutron stars. The total X-ray spectrum of the resolved
sources is well-fit by a hard power-law, while the diffuse spectrum requires a
hard and a soft component, presumably due to the relatively soft diffuse gas
and the harder unresolved sources. We also find evidence for structure in the
diffuse emission near the center of NGC4649. Specifically, there appear to be
bright ""fingers"" of emission extending from the center of the galaxy and a 5
arcsec long bar at the center of the galaxy. The fingers are morphologically
similar to radial features seen in two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of
cooling flows in elliptical galaxies, and although their other properties do
not match the predictions of the particular simulations used we conclude that
the radial fingers might be due to convective motions of hot outflowing gas and
cooler inflowing gas. The bar is coincident with the central extended radio
source; we conclude that the bar may be caused by weak shocks in the diffuse
gas from an undetected low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN).

solar masses all converge to a common final state; 2) the supernova explosion
of these very massive stars is caused by a combination of rotation, magnetic
fields and the gravitational potential, just as proposed by G. Bisnovatyi-Kogan
in 1970, based on an earlier suggestion by N.S. Kardashev in 1964; 3) their
stellar winds as well as the explosion provide the main injection of magnetic
fields into the interstellar medium; 4) the explosive energy of these
supernovae is about 10^52 erg; 5) the explosion is extremely anisotropic, which
may unify several classes of observed supernova types; 6) gamma ray bursts may
be the ultimate version of such an explosion in the case the collapse leads to
a black hole; 7)it is plausible that the luminosity of the supernova integrated
over all aspect angles is also the same for all these massive star explosions,
leading to 8) a possibly very bright standard candle, if we could just find a
correction for the extreme asphericity. This may solve the problem of what the
mechanism of supernova explosions is for very massive stars, where most cosmic
rays and magnetic fields come from, and may also point the way to a unifying
scheme for supernova explosions and gamma ray bursts.

more than 4 times higher than USS sources selected at lower frequencies. This

resolutions of both surveys constructed using the same source fitting
algorithm. The scattering of alpha >-1.3 sources into the USS sample due to

treated in detail, with an emphasis on the effects of drift (drift models). We
summarize the description of the dust formation process and make a few
additions to previous work. A detailed study shows that different growth
species dominate the grain growth rates at different drift velocities. The new
models show that the net effect of drift is to significantly increase the
amounts of dust, seemingly without affecting the mean wind properties, such as
e.g., the mass loss rate. In some cases there is several times more dust in
drift models, compared to the values in the corresponding non-drift models. We
study the formation of a dust shell in the inner parts of the wind and find
that drift plays an active role in accumulating dust to certain narrow regions.
In view of the results presented here it is questionable if drift -- under the
current assumptions -- can be ignored in the grain growth rates.

SN2003dh-like events per century in the central region of the Galaxy is
sufficient to explain the positron flux detected by INTEGRAL-SPI. In order to
explain this flux by SN Ia events alone, a rate of 0.5 per century is
necessary, much higher than indicated by Galactic evolutionary models applied

state is studied. The results are obtained by solving the Boltzmann--Lorentz
equation by means of the Chapman--Enskog method. In the first order in the
density gradient of impurities, the diffusion coefficient $D$ is determined as
the solution of a linear integral equation which is approximately solved by
making an expansion in Sonine polynomials. In this paper, we evaluate $D$ up to
the second order in the Sonine expansion and get explicit expressions for $D$
in terms of the restitution coefficients for the impurity--gas and gas--gas
collisions as well as the ratios of mass and particle sizes. To check the
reliability of the Sonine polynomial solution, analytical results are compared
with those obtained from numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation by means
of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. In the simulations, the
diffusion coefficient is measured via the mean square displacement of
impurities. The comparison between theory and simulation shows in general an
excellent agreement, except for the cases in which the gas particles are much
heavier and/or much larger than impurities. In theses cases, the second Sonine
approximation to $D$ improves significantly the qualitative predictions made
from the first Sonine approximation. A discussion on the convergence of the
Sonine polynomial expansion is also carried out.

carried out thermodynamic analyses based on the temperature dependence of the

temperature may be determined. We have also carried out structural analyses
using the radial distribution function (RDF) and common neighbor analysis

associated with metallic glasses, in fact has little to do with the glass
transition itself, but is simply a consequence of the narrowing of peaks
associated with structural features present in the liquid state. In fact the
splitting temperature for the Cu-Cu RDF is well above $T_g$. The CNA also
highlights a strong similarity between the structure of the intermetallic
alloys and the amorphous alloys of similar composition. We have also
investigated the diffusivity in the supercooled regime. Its temperature
dependence indicates fragile-liquid behavior, typical of binary metallic
glasses. On the other hand, the relatively low specific heat jump of around

assessments and experimental investigations of the different regimes of

transitions, unlike the the plateau-insulator transition, are fundamentally
affected by the presence of sample inhomogeneities. We propose a universal

It is known that the zero-frequency current is linear in the bias voltage,
while the noise derivative exhibits steps as a function of bias. In contrast,
at Laughlin fractions, the backscattering current and the backscattering noise
both exhibit evenly spaced singularities, which are reminiscent of the
tunneling density of states singularities for quasiparticles. The spacing is
determined by the quasiparticle charge $\nu e$ and the ratio of the DC bias
with respect to the drive frequency. Photo--assisted transport can thus be
considered as a probe for effective charges at such filling factors, and could
be used in the study of more complicated fractions of the Hall effect. A
non-perturbative method for studying photo--assisted transport at $\nu=1/2$ is
developed, using a refermionization procedure.

an easy water insertion channel. It is shown that the NQR spectrum of the
starting material transforms progressively under insertion of water, and
completely disappears when one H$_{2}$O molecule is inserted per unit cell.
Similarly, a Cu ZFNMR signal characteristic of this water inserted material
appears and grows with increasing water content, which indicates that the
products of the reaction are non-superconducting antiferromagnetic phases in
which the bilayers are ordered. These antiferromagnetic phases are felt by
proton NMR which reveals two sites with static internal fields of 150 and about
15 Gauss respectively. Two muon sites are also evidenced with similar local
fields which vanish at $T\approx 400$ K. This indicates that the magnetic
phases have similar N\'{e}el temperatures as the other bilayer undoped
compounds. An analysis of the internal fields on different sites of the
structure suggests that they can be all assigned to a single magnetic phase at
large water content in which the Cu(1) electron spins order with those of the
Cu(2). It appears that even samples packed in Stycast epoxy resin heated
moderately at a temperature (200$^{0}$C) undergo a reaction with epoxy
decomposition products which yield the formation of the same final compound. It

premise that the dynamics of the universe always seeks equilibrium conditions.
Vacuum-induced cosmic accelerations lead to creation of matter-energy modes at
the expense of vacuum energy. Because they gravitate, such modes constitute
inertia against cosmic acceleration. On the other extreme, the would-be
ultimate phase of local gravitational collapse is checked by a phase transition
in the collapsing matter fields leading to a de Sitter-like fluid deep inside
the black hole horizon, and at the expense of the collapsing matter fields. As
a result, the universe succumbs to neither vacuum-induced run-away
accelerations nor to gravitationally induced spacetime curvature singularities.
Cosmic dynamics is self-regulating. We discuss the physical basis for these
constraints and the implications, pointing out how the framework relates and
helps resolve standing puzzles such as ""why did cosmic inflation end?"", ""why is
Lambda small now?"" and ""why does the universe appear persistently critical?"".
The approach does, on the one hand, suggest a future course for cosmic
dynamics, while on the other hand it provides some insight into the physics

might be broken by branes. In four-dimensional effective Lagrangian, the
breaking of the isometry is seen as the spontaneous breaking of the
corresponding effective symmetry. Then it seems natural to expect that there
are various kinds of defects that will be implemented by the spontaneous
symmetry breaking. These defects are parametrized by the brane positions. In
this paper we consider two kinds of such ``brane defects'', which are formed by
the local fluctuations of the locations of branes along their transversal
directions. The fluctuation of a brane position might leads to winding (or
wraping) around a non-contractible circle of the compactified space. These
``primary'' brane defects are already discussed by several authors. On the
other hand, if there are multiple branes in the compactified space and their
configuration in a compactified space is determined by the potential that
depends only on their relative positions, one might find incidental symmetry in
the effective potential, which is spontaneously broken by branes. We examined
the latter ``incidental'' symmetry breakings and stable defect configurations.
We paid special attention to the difference between ``primary'' brane defects.

a new result, is about the non-existence of integer solutions of the cubic
diophantine equation. In the proof of this theorem we have used some known
results from theory of binary cubic forms and the method of infinite descent,
which are well understood in the purview of Elementary Number Theory(ENT). In
the second theorem, we show, that the famous Fermat's Last Theorem(FLT) for
exponent 3 and the first theorem are equivalent. So Theorem1 and 2 constitute
an alternate proof for the non-existence of integer solutions of this famous
cubic Fermat's equation. It is well known, that from L.Euler(1770) to
F.J.Duarte(1944) many had given proof of FLT for exponent 3. But all proofs
uses concepts, which are beyond the scope of ENT. Hence unlike other proofs the
proof given here is as an ENT proof of FLT for exponent 3.

regime, and the observation of a variety of strongly nonexponential lineshapes
for dynamical localization. The results provide excellent examples of
controlled quantum dynamics in a system that is classically chaotic and offer
new opportunities to explore quantum fluctuations and correlations in quantum
chaos.

to the beam splitter realizing the BSM by two 2 km long optical fibers. In
addition, the teleported qubits are analyzed after 2,2 km of optical fiber, in
another lab separated by 55 m. Time bin qubits carried by photons at 1310 nm
are teleported onto photons at 1550 nm. The fidelity is of 77%, above the
maximal value obtainable without entanglement. This is the first realization of
an elementary quantum relay over significant distances, which will allow an
increase in the range of quantum communication and quantum key distribution.

functions and the related fault-tolerant quantum decision trees, where input
bits are perturbed by noise. We compare several different possible definitions.
Our main results are
  * For every n-bit Boolean function f there is an n-variate polynomial p of
degree O(n) that robustly approximates it, in the sense that p(x) remains close
to f(x) if we slightly vary each of the n inputs of the polynomial.
  * There is an O(n)-query quantum algorithm that robustly recovers n noisy
input bits. Hence every n-bit function can be quantum computed with O(n)
queries in the presence of noise. This contrasts with the classical model of
Feige et al., where functions such as parity need Theta(n*log n) queries.
  We give several extensions and applications of these results.

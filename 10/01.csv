pressure fluid which could be the origin of the cosmic acceleration. We derive
a model independent relation between the neutrino mass and the equation of
state parameter of the neutrino dark energy, which is applicable for general
theories of mass varying particles. The neutrino mass depends on the local
neutrino density and the observed neutrino mass can exceed the cosmological
bound on a constant neutrino mass. We discuss microscopic realizations of the
MaVaN acceleration scenario, which involve a sterile neutrino. We consider
naturalness constraints for mass varying particles, and find that both ev
cutoffs and ev mass particles are needed to avoid fine-tuning. These
considerations give a (current) mass of order an eV for the sterile neutrino in
microscopic realizations, which could be detectable at MiniBooNE. Because the
sterile neutrino was much heavier at earlier times, constraints from big bang
nucleosynthesis on additional states are not problematic. We consider regions
of high neutrino density and find that the most likely place today to find
neutrino masses which are significantly different from the neutrino masses in
our solar system is in a supernova. The possibility of different neutrino mass
in different regions of the galaxy and the local group could be significant for
Z-burst models of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We also consider the cosmology
of and the constraints on the ``acceleron'', the scalar field which is
responsible for the varying neutrino mass, and briefly discuss neutrino density
dependent variations in other constants, such as the fine structure constant.

levels of turbulence the outcome is usually a binary, or higher-order multiple,
system. We take as the initial conditions for these simulations a typical
low-mass core, based on the average properties of a large sample of observed
cores. All the simulated cores start with a mass of $M = 5.4 M_{\odot}$, a
flattened central density profile, a ratio of thermal to gravitational energy
$\alpha_{\rm therm} = 0.45$ and a ratio of turbulent to gravitational energy
$\alpha_{\rm turb} = 0.05 $. Even this low level of turbulence is sufficient to
produce multiple star formation in 80% of the cores; the mean number of stars
and brown dwarfs formed from a single core is 4.55, and the maximum is 10. At
the outset, the cores have no large-scale rotation. The only difference between
each individual simulation is the detailed structure of the turbulent velocity
field. The multiple systems formed in the simulations have properties
consistent with observed multiple systems. Dynamical evolution tends
preferentially to eject lower mass stars and brown dwarves whilst hardening the
remaining binaries so that the median semi-major axis of binaries formed is
$\sim 30$ au. Ejected objects are usually single low-mass stars and brown
dwarfs, yielding a strong correlation between mass and multiplicity. Our
simulations suggest a natural mechanism for forming binary stars that does not
require large-scale rotation, capture, or large amounts of turbulence.

A generalized kinematic model is presented which includes radial drifts and
non-Keplerian rotations for the line emitters. The resulting line profiles are
obtained with an object-oriented ray tracer operating in the curved Kerr
background metric. The general form of the Doppler factor is presented which
includes all kinds of poloidal and toroidal motions near the horizon. The
parameters of the model include the spin parameter, the inclination, the
truncation and outer radius of the disk, velocity profiles for rotation and
radial drift, the emissivity profile and a multi-species line-system. The red
wing flux is generally reduced when radial drift is included as compared to the
pure Keplerian velocity field. All resulting emission line profiles can be
classified as triangular, double-horned, double-peaked, bumpy and
shoulder-like. Of particular interest are emission line profiles generated by
truncated standard accretion disks (TSD). It is also shown that the emissivity
law has a great influence on the profiles. The characteristic shoulder-like

places limits on the mean surface brightness of the population of reionization
sources. Reducing the number of model-dependent assumptions to a minimum, we
discuss the observability of these sources with existing and planned
telescopes. We define a family of models characterized by two parameters: the
Lyman continuum escape fraction f_c from the sources, and the clumpiness
parameter C of the intergalactic medium. The minimum surface brightness model
corresponds to a value of unity for both parameters. We find that the detection
of the non-ionizing UV continuum of the reionization sources will be difficult
to accomplish before the launch of JWST if these sources have a mean surface
brightness close to the minimum value. However, if the values of f_c and C are
more realistic, the reionization sources may well be detected by HST before
JWST, perhaps by exploiting gravitational lensing amplification by foreground
clusters of galaxies. Instead of a detection in the continuum, one may attempt
to detect the Lyalpha emission line by narrow-band imaging. Present Lyalpha
searches at z>6 suggest that either the typical sources are fainter than dwarf
galaxies, or that the escape fraction of ionizing photons is much higher than
50%, so that there are no bright compact HII regions formed around the ionizing
sources.

create rich clusters with cool, central X-Ray excesses. The rich cool clusters
do not possess ``cooling flows'' due to the presence of bulk velocities in the
intracluster medium in excess of 1000 km/sec produced by on-going accretion of

curves. Mass models of disk galaxies have well-known degeneracies, that prevent
a unique mass decomposition. The most notable is due to the unknown value of
the stellar mass-to-light ratio (the disk-halo degeneracy); even with this
known, degeneracies between the halo parameters themselves may prevent an
unambiguous determination of the shape of the dark halo profile, which includes
the inner density slope of the dark matter halo. The latter is often referred
to as the ``cusp-core degeneracy''. We explore constraints on the disk and halo
parameters and apply these to four mock and six observed disk galaxies with
high resolution and extended rotation curves. Our full set of constraints
consists of mass-to-light (M/L) ratios from stellar population synthesis models
based on B-R colors, constraints on halo parameters from N-body simulations,
and constraining the halo virial velocity to be less than the maximum observed
velocity. These constraints are only partially successful in lifting the
cusp-core degeneracy. The effect of adiabatic contraction of the halo by the
disk is to steepen cores into cusps and reduce the best-fit halo concentration
and M/L values (often significantly). We also discuss the effect of disk
thickness, halo flattening, distance errors, and rotation curve error values on
mass modeling. Increasing the imposed minimum rotation curve error from
typically low, underestimated values to more realistic estimates decreases the
chi-square substantially and makes distinguishing between a cuspy or cored halo
profile even more difficult. In spite of the degeneracies and uncertainties
present, our constrained mass modeling favors sub-maximal disks (i.e., a
dominant halo) at 2.2 disk scale lengths, with Vdisk/Vtot < 0.6.

harmonic (ASH) code, which solves the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in
the anelastic approximation, to examine highly nonlinear flows that can span
multiple scale heights. The cores of these stars are found to rotate
differentially, with central cylindrical regions of strikingly slow rotation
achieved in our simulations of stars whose convective Rossby number (R_{oc}) is
less than unity. Such differential rotation results from the redistribution of
angular momentum by the nonlinear convection that strongly senses the overall
rotation of the star. Penetrative convective motions extend into the overlying
radiative zone, yielding a prolate shape (aligned with the rotation axis) to
the central region in which nearly adiabatic stratification is achieved. This
is further surrounded by a region of overshooting motions, the extent of which
is greater at the equator than at the poles, yielding an overall spherical
shape to the domain experiencing at least some convective mixing. We assess the
overshooting achieved as the stability of the radiative exterior is varied, and
the weak circulations that result in that exterior. The convective plumes serve

under-abundant in slow, faint novae relative to the Milky Way and M31. Instead,
the decline rates of the M49 novae are remarkably similar to those of novae in
the LMC. This fact argues against a simple classification of novae in ""bulge""
and ""disk"" sub-classes. We examine the Maximum-Magnitude versus Rate of Decline
(MMRD) relation for novae in M49, finding only marginal agreement with the
Galactic and M31 MMRD relations. A recalibration of the Buscombe-de Vaucouleurs
relation gives an absolute magnitude 15 days past maximum of M_{V,15} =
-6.36+/-0.19, which is substantially brighter than previous calibrations based
on Galactic novae. Monte Carlo simulations yield a global nova rate for M49 of
100{+35}{-30} per year, and a luminosity-specific nova rate in the range \nu_K
= 1.7-2.5 per year per 10^{-10} L_K,solar. These rates are far lower than those
predicted by current models of nova production in elliptical galaxies and may
point to a relative scarity of novae progenitors, or an increased recurrence
timescale, in early-type environments.

modifies the distance-redshift relation and the mass function of dark matter
halos leading to changes in the lensing optical depth as a function of image
separation. Those effects must, however, be distinguished from effects
associated with the structure of dark matter halos. Baryonic cooling causes
galaxy-mass halos to have different central density profiles than group- and
cluster-mass halos, which causes the distribution of normal arcsecond-scale
lenses to differ from the distribution of ``wide-separation'' ($\Delta\theta
\gtrsim 4\arcsec$) lenses. Fortunately, the various parameters related to
cosmology and halo structure have very different effects on the overall image
separation distribution: (1) the abundance of wide-separation lenses is
exremely sensitive (by orders of magnitude) to the distribution of
``concentration'' parameters for massive halos modeled with the
Navarro-Frenk-White profile; (2) the transition between normal and
wide-separation lenses depends mainly on the mass scale where baryonic cooling
ceases to be efficient; and (3) dark energy has effects at all image separation
scales. While current lens samples cannot usefully constrain all of the
parameters, ongoing and future imaging surveys should discover hundreds or
thousands of lenses and make it possible to disentangle the various effects and
constrain all of the parameters simultaneously. (abridged)

expanding HI IGM (intergalactic medium) around the first star clusters and the
ionized interstellar medium, is investigated by solving a radiative transfer
problem. While the initial scattering optical depth is $\sim 10^5$ for the
Ly$\alpha$ photons, most of the Ly$\alpha$ photons can escape when the
cumulative frequency-shift due to the expansion of the HI IGM becomes
significantly large. The current paper improves upon previous treatments of the
scattering processes and the opacity for the Ly$\alpha$ transfer. Confirming
the previous results of the LR halo, we investigate the effect of the
aspherical expansion of the IGM. The asphericity is hypothesized to follow the
initial stage of the gravitational deceleration to form the large scale
filamentary structure of the Universe. According to our results, the effect of
the asphericity lets the peak wavelength of the line profile shift to longer
wavelengths and the FWHM of the profile become wider than those of the
spherically expanding model. To detect these features is meaningful if we are
interested in the initial evolution of the large scale structure, since they
reflect the dynamical properties of the IGM at that time. Furthermore, given
the recent discovery of the high redshift cosmological reionization, we briefly
comment on the effects of the redshift and the cosmological parameters on the
line profile.

Initially, we assume that the core collapse has failed in this star. A few

simulations presented in the paper follow the accretion of gas into a black
hole that is assumed to have formed before the calculation begins.The
simulation results show the formation of a disk-like structure and the
generation of a jetlike outflow inside the shock wave launched at the core
bounce. We have found that the jet is accelerated by the magnetic pressure and
the centrifugal force and is collimated by the pinching force of the toroidal
magnetic field amplified by the rotation and the effect of geometry of the
poloidal magnetic field. The maximum velocity of the jet is mildly relativistic
(0.3c). The velocity of the jet becomes larger as the initial rotational
velocity of stellar matter gets faster. On the other hand, the dependence on
the initial magnetic field strength is a bit more complicated: the velocity of
the jet increases with the initial field strength in the weak field regime,
then is saturated at some intermediate field strength, and decreases beyond the
critical field strength. These results are related to the stored magnetic
energy determined by the balance between the propagation time of the Alfven
wave and the rotation time of the disk (or twisting time).

optical/near-infrared components is greater than that observed in radio and
X-ray studies, arguing that even in K-band we may not be seeing all the way
through the dust to the true nuclei. The ionized gas does not display rotation
around either of the nuclei, or equilibrium motion in general. There is a
strong velocity gradient between the nuclei, similar to what is seen in CO
data. There is no such gradient in our stellar kinematics. The velocity
dispersion of the gas is larger than expected for a cold disk. We also map and
model the emission-line velocity field at an off-nuclear position where a steep
velocity gradient was previously detected in ground-based data. Overall, the
data indicate that line-of-sight projection effects, dust absorption,
non-equilibrium merger dynamics, and the possible influence of a wind may be
playing an important role in the observed kinematics. Chandra observations of
hard X-rays have shown that both of the nuclei contain an Active Galactic
Nucleus (AGN). The HST data show no clear sign of the two AGNs: neither
continuum nor narrow-band imaging shows evidence for unresolved components in
the nuclei, and there are no increased emission line widths or rapid rotation
near the nuclei. This underscores the importance of X-ray data for identifying

envelopes, LBV stars, young stars in formation) shows structures in their
accretion/ejection phase that have similar characteristics. In particular, one
currently observes for these objects equatorial discs, axial ejections and
stable bipolar shells. However these simple shapes, which are expected to be
solutions of standard hydrodynamical equations, are not yet fully understood.
In this paper, we suggest a new form of these equations that takes into account
the fractality and the irreversibility of particle motion in such processes.
Then we study in this framework a general infall or ejection motion in a
central spherical potential. From the stationary solutions allowed by this new
hydrodynamical system, we deduce a specific distribution of matter density,
described in terms of probability density for ejection angles. A global
classification of predicted shapes, depending on the values of conservative
quantities such as (E^2,L^2,L_z), is given. These results are compared with the
available observational data, and allows us to theoretically predict the
possible existence of more complicated structures and of correlations between
observable variables, which could be checked by future observations.

  Fluid Mechanics","J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 116 (2004) 235-268",,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.flu-dyn",,"  It is well known that the Poiseuille flow of a visco-elastic polymer fluid
between plates or through a tube is linearly stable in the zero Reynolds number
limit, although the stability is weak for large Weissenberg numbers. In this
paper we argue that recent experimental and theoretical work on the instability
of visco-elastic fluids in Taylor-Couette cells and numerical work on channel
flows suggest a scenario in which Poiseuille flow of visco-elastic polymer
fluids exhibits a nonlinear ""subcritical"" instability due to normal stress
effects, with a threshold which decreases for increasing Weissenberg number.
This proposal is confirmed by an explicit weakly nonlinear stability analysis
for Poiseuille flow of an UCM fluid. Our analysis yields explicit predictions
for the critical amplitude of velocity perturbations beyond which the flow is
nonlinearly unstable, and for the wavelength of the mode whose critical
amplitude is smallest. The nonlinear instability sets in quite abruptly at
Weissenberg numbers around 4 in the planar case and about 5.2 in the
cylindrical case, so that for Weissenberg numbers somewhat larger than these
values perturbations of the order of a few percent in the wall shear stress
suffice to make the flow unstable. We have suggested elsewhere that this
nonlinear instability could be an important intrinsic route to melt fracture
and that preliminary experiments are both qualitatively and quantitatively in
good agreement with these predictions.

In a certain regime, a quantum phase transition is found which is characterized

externally applied pressure increases. This transition takes place when the
d-wave superconducting critical temperature, $T_c$, intercepts the magnetic
critical temperature, $T_m$, under increasing pressure. Calculations of the

hydrodynamics. It marks the transition between the ""laminar"" and turbulent
regimes of vortex dynamics. The developed turbulence described by Kolmogorov
cascade occurs when Re >> 1 in classical hydrodynamics, and q << 1 in the
superfluid hydrodynamics. Another parameter of the superfluid turbulence is the
superfluid Reynolds number Re_s=UR/\kappa, which contains the circulation
quantum \kappa characterizing quantized vorticity in superfluids. This
parameter may regulate the crossover or transition between two classes of
superfluid turbulence: (i) the classical regime of Kolmogorov cascade where
vortices are locally polarized and the quantization of vorticity is not
important; and (ii) the quantum Vinen turbulence whose properties are
determined by the quantization of vorticity. The phase diagram of the dynamical
vortex states is suggested.

measured on a lattice by Michael and Peisa in Phys. Rev. D 58, 34506 (1998). We
have now repeated this study using a larger, quenched lattice to check that
there the finite size effects are under control. Also the effect of quenching
is studied by using dynamical fermion configurations. In the latter case the
lattice spacing a is smaller, which allows one to make an estimate of a -> 0
corrections. The new measurements confirm the earlier calculated energy
spectrum.
  From some theoretical considerations it is expected that, for high angular
momentum states, the multiplets should be inverted compared with the Coulomb
spectrum, i.e. L- should lie higher than L+ (see H. J. Schnitzer Phys. Lett. B
226, 171 (1989)). This happens when a pure scalar confining potential is
present. Here the notation L+(-) means that the light quark spin couples to
angular momentum L giving the total j=L+/- 1/2. Experimentally this inversion
is not seen for P-wave mesons, and lattice measurements now suggest that there
is no inversion in the D-wave either. Indeed we find that the spin-orbit
splitting is very small for both values L=1 and 2. This almost exact
cancellation need not be a coincidence, and could probably be understood by
using straightforward symmetry arguments (P.R. Page, T. Goldman and J.N.
Ginocchio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 204 (2001)).

the elastic scattering on target nuclei through nuclear recoils. Finally, we

supersymmetric extensions of the standard model, where the leading candidate
for WIMP, the neutralino, is present. There, we compute the cross section for
the direct detection of neutralinos, and compare it with the sensitivity of

Nucleosynthesis (BBN) during the first 20 minutes in the evolution of the

baryometer, helium-4 provides an accurate chronometer. Some 400 kyr later, when
the cosmic background radiation (CBR) was freed from the grasp of the ionized
plasma of protons and electrons, the spectrum of temperature fluctuations also
depended on (among other parameters) the baryon density and the density in
relativistic particles. The comparison between the constraints imposed by BBN
and those from the CBR reveals a remarkably consistent picture of the Universe
at two widely separated epochs in its evolution. Combining these two probes
leads to new estimates of the baryon density at present and tighter constraints
on possible physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. In this
review the consistency between these complementary probes of the universal
baryon density and the early-Universe expansion rate is exploited to provide
new constraints on any asymmetry between relic neutrinos and anti-neutrinos

strongly reinforced by fact that combined solar neutrino data i) exclude the

extended to include the classification of families of quarks and leptons. We
assume that the family group (the group which unites the families) is also the
SU(4) group. The properties of the 4-th generation of fermions are the same as
that of the ordinary-matter fermions in first three generations except for the
family charge of the SU(4)_F group: F=(1/3,1/3,1/3,-1), where F=1/3 for
fermions of ordinary matter and F=-1 for the 4-th generation. The difference in
F does not allow the mixing between ordinary and fourth-generation fermions.
Because of the conservation of the F charge, the creation of baryons and
leptons in the process of electroweak baryogenesis must be accompanied by the
creation of fermions of the 4-th generation. As a result the excess n_B of
baryons over antibaryons leads to the excess n_{\nu 4}=N-\bar N=n_B of
neutrinos over antineutrinos in the 4-th generation. This massive
fourth-generation neutrino may form the non-baryonic dark matter. In principle
their mass density n_{\nu 4}m_N in the Universe can give the main contribution
to the dark matter, since the lower bound on neutrino mass m_N from the data on
decay of the Z-bosons is m_N > m_Z/2. The straightforward prediction of this
model leads to the amount of cold dark matter relative to baryons, which is an
order of magnitude bigger than allowed by observations. This inconsistency may
be avoided by non-conservation of the F-charge.

oscillations provide the best description of the SK+K2K data, and that the
associated mass-mixing parameters are determined at 1 sigma (and dof=1) as:
Delta m^2=(2.6 +-0.4) x 10^-3 eV^2 and sin^2(2theta)=1.00+0.00-0.05. Such
indications, presently dominated by SK, could be strengthened by further K2K
data. Then we analyze the energy spectrum of reactor neutrino events recently
observed at KamLAND and combine them with solar and terrestrial neutrino data.

LMA-II. The LMA-I solution, characterized by lower values of the squared

as moving the D-brane, but nilpotent Higgs vevs have zero eigenvalues, and so
their interpretation is more interesting -- for example, they often correspond
to nonreduced schemes, which furnishes an important link in understanding old
results relating classical D-brane moduli spaces in orbifolds to Hilbert
schemes, resolutions of quotient spaces, and the McKay correspondence. We give
a sheaf-theoretic description of D-branes with Higgs vevs, including nilpotent
Higgs vevs, and check that description by noting that Ext groups between the
sheaves modelling the D-branes, do in fact correctly count open string states.
In particular, our analysis expands the types of sheaves which admit on-shell
physical interpretations, which is an important step for making derived
categories useful for physics.

seen that one can recover the FRW cosmology in the Hubble expansion era with
relativistic matter, but if a solution exist with non-relativistic (massive)
matter it must be non-static with a Hubble constant that depends on the fifth
dimension. (The same result holds when 5-branes are present.) This difficulty
is traced to the fact that in HW, the volume modulus couples to the bulk and
brane cosmological constants (so that the net 4D constant vanishes naturally).
This situation is contrasted with the Randall-Sundrum 1 model (which is here
treated without making the stiff potential approximation) where the radion
field does not couple to the cosmological constants (and so one must instead
fine tune the net constant to zero). One finds that non-relativistic matter is
accommodated there by changing the distance between the end branes.

appropriately, black hole solutions may emerge with an arbitrary number of
Killing horizons. The absence of dilatino and gravitino hair is proven.
Moreover, the impossibility of supersymmetric dS ground states and of
nonextremal black holes is confirmed, even in the presence of a dilaton. In
these derivations the knowledge of the general analytic solution of 2D dilaton
supergravity plays an important role. The latter result is addressed in the

was held on an ontological ground. The completeness problem becomes more
tractable, however, if it is preliminarily discussed from a semantic viewpoint.
Indeed every physical theory adopts, explicitly or not, a truth theory for its
observative language, in terms of which the notions of semantic objectivity and
semantic completeness of the physical theory can be introduced and inquired. In
particular, standard QM adopts a verificationist theory of truth that implies
its semantic nonobjectivity; moreover, we show in this paper that standard QM
is semantically complete, which matches Bohr's thesis. On the other hand, one
of the authors has provided a Semantic Realism (or SR) interpretation of QM
that adopts a Tarskian theory of truth as correspondence for the observative
language of QM (which was previously mantained to be impossible); according to
this interpretation QM is semantically objective, yet incomplete, which matches
EPR's thesis. Thus, standard QM and the SR interpretation of QM come to
opposite conclusions. These can be reconciled within an integrationist
perspective that interpretes non-Tarskian theories of truth as theories of
metalinguistic concepts different from truth.

quantum systems, and quantum systems with Abelian superselection rules.

Lett. 92, 203601 (2004)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.203601",,"quant-ph",,"  We report the first measurement of the quantum phase-difference noise of an
ultrastable nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator that emits twin beams
classically phase-locked at exact frequency degeneracy. The measurement
illustrates the property of a lossless balanced beam-splitter to convert
number-difference squeezing into phase-difference squeezing and, thus, provides
indirect evidence for Heisenberg-limited interferometry using twin beams. This
experiment is a generalization of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference effect for
continuous variables and constitutes a milestone towards continuous-variable
entanglement of bright, ultrastable nondegenerate beams.

in terms of the measurement statistics of projective spin measurements along a
minimum of 4l+1 different spin directions. It is thus possible to represent the
complete quantum statistics of any N-level system within the spherically
symmetric three dimensional space defined by the spin vector. An explicit
method for reconstructing the density matrix of a spin-1 system from the
measurement statistics of five non-orthogonal spin directions is presented and
the generalization to spin-l systems is discussed.

single-particle systems or multi-particle systems, the realistic interpretation
of a superposition state that mathematically describes the ensemble does not
imply that the ensemble is a mixture. Therefore it cannot be argued that the
realistic interpretation is wrong on the basis that some predictions derived
from the mixture are different from the corresponding predictions derived from
the superposition state.

channels, by considering superpositions of coherent and squeezed-coherent
states coupled to an arbitrarily squeezed bath. The phase space dynamics is
solved and decoherence is studied keeping track of the purity of the evolving
state. The influence of the choice of the state and channel parameters on
purity is discussed and optimal working regimes that minimize the decoherence
rate are determined. In particular, we show that squeezing the bath to protect
a non squeezed cat state against decoherence is equivalent to orthogonally
squeezing the initial cat state while letting the bath be phase insensitive.

long-range helium dimers produced by photoassociation (PA) in an ultra-cold gas
of metastable helium atoms. The experimental spectrum obtained with the PA
laser tuned closed to the $2^3S_1\leftrightarrow 2^3P_0$ atomic line has been
reported in a previous Letter. Here, we first focus on the corrections to be
applied to the measured resonance frequencies in order to infer the molecular
binding energies. We then present a calculation of the vibrational spectra for
the purely long-range molecular states, using adiabatic potentials obtained
from perturbation theory. With retardation effects taken into account, the
agreement between experimental and theoretical determinations of the spectrum
for the $0_u^+$ purely long-range potential well is very good. The results
yield a determination of the lifetime of the $2^3P$ atomic state.

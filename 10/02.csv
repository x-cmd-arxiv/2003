cooling flow cluster Abell 1068. We detect a clear temperature gradient in the
X-ray emitting gas from kT ~ 5 keV in the outer part of the cluster down to
roughly 2 keV in the core, and a striking increase in the metallicity of the
gas toward the cluster center. The total spectrum from the cluster can be fit
by a cooling flow model with a total mass deposition rate of 150 solar
masses/yr. Within the core (r < 30 kpc), the mass depositon rate of 40 solar
masses/yr is comparable to estimates for the star formation rate from optical
data. We find an apparent correlation between the cD galaxy's optical isophotes
and enhanced metallicity isocontours in the central ~100 kpc of the cluster. We
show that the approximate doubling of the metallicity associated with the cD
can be plausibly explained by supernova explosions associated with the cD's
ambient stellar population and the recent starburst. Finally, we calculate the
amount of heating due to thermal conduction and show that this process is
unlikely to offset cooling in Abell 1068.

the cD galaxy is experiencing star formation at a rate of ~20-70 M_o/yr over
the past ~100 Myr. The dusty starburst is concentrated toward the nucleus of
the cD galaxy and in filamentary structures projecting 60 kpc into its halo.
The Chandra X-ray image presented in WMM reveals a steep temperature gradient
that drops from roughly 4.8 keV beyond 120 kpc to roughly 2.3 keV in the inner
10 kpc of the galaxy where the starburst peaks. Over 95% of the ultraviolet and
Halpha photons associated with the starburst are emerging from regions cloaked
in keV gas with very short cooling times ~100 Myr, as would be expected from
star formation fueled by cooling condensations in the intracluster medium. The
local cooling rate in the vicinity of the central starburst is < 40 M_o/yr,
which is consistent with the star formation rate determined with U-band and
infrared data. We find that energy feedback from both the radio source and
thermal conduction are inconsequential in Abell 1068. Although supernova
explosions associated with the starburst may be able to retard by ~18% or so,
they are incapable of maintaining the cooling gas at keV temperatures.

the cosmological problem of the formation and evolution of gravitational

hypothesis of differentiability of space-time coordinates. As a consequence of
this generalization, space-time is not only curved, but also fractal. In
analogy with Einstein's general relativistic methods, we describe the effects
of space fractality on motion by the construction of a covariant derivative.
The principle of equivalence allows us to write the equation of dynamics as a
geodesics equation that takes the form of the equation of free Galilean motion.
Then, after a change of variables, this equation can be integrated in terms of
a gravitational Schrodinger equation that involves a new fundamental
gravitational coupling constant, alpha_{g} = w_{0}/c. Its solutions give
probability densities that quantitatively describe precise morphologies in the
position space and in the velocity space. Finally the theoretical predictions
are successfully checked by a comparison with observational data: we find that
matter is self-organized in accordance with the solutions of the gravitational
Schrodinger equation on the basis of the universal constant w_{0}=144.7 +- 0.7

as via Doppler broadening and shifting of metal lines in the X-ray spectrum. We

emission-line region (VEELR) found serendipitously around the Seyfert 2 galaxy
NGC 4388 in the Virgo cluster using the Subaru Telescope. The H-alpha recession
velocities of most of the filaments of the region observed are highly
blue-shifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the galaxy. The velocity
field is complicated, and from the kinematic and morphological points of view,
there seem to be several streams of filaments: low velocity (v = -100 km/s)
filaments, high velocity (v = -300 km/s) filaments, and a very high velocity (v
> -500 km/s) cloud complex. The emission-line ratios of the VEELR filaments are
well explained by power-law photoionization models with solar abundances,
suggesting that the Seyfert nucleus of NGC 4388 is the dominant ionization
source of the VEELR and that the VEELR gas has moderate metallicity. In
addition to photoionization, shock heating probably contributes to the
ionization of the gas. In particular, the filaments outside the ionization cone
of the Seyfert nucleus are mainly excited by shocks. We conclude that the VEELR
was formerly the disk gas of NGC 4388, which has been stripped by ram pressure
due to the interaction between the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) and the
galaxy. The velocity field and the morphology of the VEELR closely resemble
snapshots from some numerical simulations of this process. In the case of NGC
4388, the ram pressure-stripped gas, which is normally seen as extended HI
filaments, happens to be exposed and ionized by the radiation from the AGN, and
so can be seen as optical emission-line gas.

present-day galaxies are probably the product of successive minor mergers. The
frequent galactic merges at high redshift imply that active galaxy harbors
supermassive unequal-mass binary black holes in its center at least once during
its life time. In this paper, we showed that the recently discovered
double-lobed FR II radio galaxies are the remnants of such supermassive binary
black holes. The inspiraling secondary black hole opens a gap in the accretion
disk and removes the inner accretion disk when it merges into the primary black
hole, leaving a big hole of about several hundreds of Schwarzschild radius in
the vicinity of the post-merged supermassive black hole and leading to an
interruption of jet formation. When the outer accretion disk slowly refills the
big hole on a viscous time scale, the jet formation restarts and the
interaction of the recurrent jets and the inter-galactic medium forms a
secondary pair of lobes. We applied the model to a particular double-lobed
radio source B1834+620 and showed that the orbit of the secondary is elliptical
with a typical eccentricity $e \simeq 0.68$ and the mass ratio $q$ of the
secondary and the primary is $0.01 \la q \la 0.4$. The accretion disk is a
standard $\alpha$-disk with $0.01 \la \alpha \la 0.04$ and the ratio of disk
half height $H$ and radius $r$ is $\delta \simeq 0.01$. The model predicates
that double-lobed radio structure forms only in FR II radio galaxies.

only by astrophysical foregrounds, and robust detection of polarisation
anisotropy. Planck will observe the sky with two instruments over a wide

the Jeans equation yields a non-parametric estimate of the cumulative mass
profile M(<r), which has a logarithmic slope of -2.4 +/- 0.4 in the density
profile at the virial radius. We compare our result with several analytical
models from the literature (NFW, Moore et al. 1999, softened isothermal sphere,

appears to be traced remarkably well by the luminosity density of the

patterns often involves two degrees of freedom: drift and out-of-phase
oscillations of cells, respectively associated to parity breaking and
vacillating-breathing secondary bifurcations. In this paper, the interaction
between these two modes is investigated in the case of a single domain
propagating along a circular array of liquid jets. As observed by Michalland

a constant width domain is linked to the angular frequency $\omega$ of
oscillations and to the spacing between columns $\lambda_0$ by the relationship
$ V_g = \alpha \lambda_0 \omega$. We show by a simple geometrical argument that
$\alpha$ should be close to $1/ \pi$ instead of the initial value $\alpha =
1/2$ deduced from their analogy with phonons. This fact is in quantitative
agreement with our data, with a slight deviation increasing with flow rate.

Brownian motion of a very fine wire immersed in an equilibrium environment, a

the most important ideas of equilibrium statistical mechanics: the very
complicated many-particle problem of a large number of molecules colliding with
the wire, can be represented by two macroscopic parameters only, namely
viscosity and the temperature. Can this idea, mathematically developed in the
so-called Langevin model and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem be used to
describe systems that are far from equilibrium? Here we address the question
and reproduce the Gerlach and Lehrer experiment in an archetype non-equilibrium
system, by immersing a sensitive torsion oscillator in a granular system of
millimetre-size grains, fluidized by strong external vibrations. The
vibro-fluidized granular medium is a driven environment, with continuous
injection and dissipation of energy, and the immersed oscillator can be seen as
analogous to an elastically bound Brownian particle. We show, by measuring the
noise and the susceptibility, that the experiment can be treated, in first
approximation, with the same formalism as in the equilibrium case, giving
experimental access to a ''granular viscosity'' and an ''effective
temperature'', however anisotropic and inhomogeneous, and yielding the
surprising result that the vibro-fluidized granular matter behaves as a
''thermal'' bath satisfying a fluctuation-dissipation relation.

momentum commutation relations are abandoned in favour of Wigner's suggestion
that Hamilton's equations and the Heisenberg equations are identical as

corresponding to a family of irreducible representations of the Lie
superalgebra sl(1|3n) indexed by an A-superstatistics parameter p. These
representations are typical for p\geq 3n but atypical for p<3n. The branching
rules for the restriction from sl(1|3n) to gl(1) \oplus so(3) \oplus sl(n) are
used to enumerate energy and angular momentum eigenstates. These are
constructed explicitly and tabulated for n\leq 2. It is shown that measurements
of the coordinates of the individual particles gives rise to a set of discrete
values defining nests in the 3-dimensional configuration space. The fact that
the underlying geometry is non-commutative is shown to have a significant
impact on measurements of particle separation. In the atypical case, exclusion
phenomena are identified that are entirely due to the effect of
A-superstatistics. The energy spectrum and associated degeneracies are
calculated for an infinite-dimensional realisation of the Wigner quantum
oscillator model obtained by summing over all p. The results are compared with

Correspondingly, every combinatorial Hopf algebra $(H,\zeta)$ possesses two
canonical Hopf subalgebras on which the character $\zeta$ is even

relations which we call the generalized Dehn-Sommerville relations. We show
that, for $H=QSym$, the generalized Dehn-Sommerville relations are the

Stembridge. We prove that $QSym$ is the product (in the categorical sense) of

parallel to the arrays. One of these resonances is with respect to frequency
(which is common to all types of Bragg scattering), and another is with respect
to phase variation between the arrays. The diffractional divergence of the
scattered wave is shown to be the main physical reason for DEAS in the
considered structure. Although the arrays are separated, they are shown to
interact by means of the diffractional divergence of the scattered wave across
the gap from one array into the other. It is also shown that increasing
separation between the two arrays results in a broader and weaker resonance
with respect to phase shift. The analysis is based on a recently developed new
approach allowing for the diffractional divergence of the scattered wave inside

  Multiscale Modeling and Simulation, Lugano, Lecture Notes in Computational
  Science and Engineering",,,"TW-370","physics.comp-ph",,"  An important class of problems exhibits macroscopically smooth behaviour in
space and time, while only a microscopic evolution law is known. For such
time-dependent multi-scale problems, the gap-tooth scheme has recently been
proposed. The scheme approximates the evolution of an unavailable (in closed
form) macroscopic equation in a macroscopic domain; it only uses appropriately
initialized simulations of the available microscopic model in a number of small
boxes. For some model problems, including numerical homogenization, the scheme
is essentially equivalent to a finite difference scheme, provided we repeatedly
impose appropriate algebraic constraints on the solution for each box. Here, we
demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a convergent scheme without
constraining the microscopic code, by introducing buffers that ""shield"" over
relatively short times the dynamics inside each box from boundary effects. We
explore and quantify the behavior of these schemes systematically through the
numerical computation of damping factors of the corresponding coarse
time-stepper, for which no closed formula is available.

are of great clinical relevance in pathophysiologic investigations. In
particular, respiration is a powerful modulator of HRV contributing to the
oscillations at highest frequency. Like almost all natural phenomena, HRV is
the result of many nonlinearly interacting processes; therefore any linear
analysis has the potential risk of underestimating, or even missing, a great
amount of information content. Recently the technique of Empirical Mode
Decomposition (EMD) has been proposed as a new tool for the analysis of
nonlinear and nonstationary data. We applied EMD analysis to decompose the
heartbeat intervals series, derived from one electrocardiographic (ECG) signal
of 13 subjects, into their components in order to identify the modes associated
with breathing. After each decomposition the mode showing the highest frequency
and the corresponding respiratory signal were Hilbert transformed and the
instantaneous phases extracted were then compared. The results obtained
indicate a synchronization of order 1:1 between the two series proving the
existence of phase and frequency coupling between the component associated with
breathing and the respiratory signal itself in all subjects.

population inside a selected subspace, leaving the others in a highly
dispersive regime. Selectivity allows us to generate motional Fock (and other
nonclassical) states with high purity out of a wide class of initial states,
and becomes an unconventional cooling mechanism when the ground state is
chosen. Individual population of number states can be distinctively measured,
as well as the motional Wigner function. Furthermore, a protocol for
implementing quantum logic through a suitable control of selective subspaces is
presented.

  possible motion: The 2-slit problem with attempted detection","15 pages, 4 figures, Latex2, submitted to J Phys A with a short
  addition to Sec. 3.2",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Starting with a down to earth interpretation of quantum mechanics for a free
particle, the disappearance and reappearance of interference in the 2 slit
problem with a detector behind one are treated in detail. A partial
interpretation of quantum theory is employed which is simple, emphasizing
description, yet adequate for addressing the present problem.
  Given that the eigenvalue equation is essential to predict a free particle's
probability of collision, it is argued that there is equal need for a realistic
theory to describe its possible motion. Feynman's point-to-point space-time
wave packet is put forth and used as the appropriate description of the
field-free motion between collisions.
  For a particle in a conventional 2-slit experiment with attempted detection
behind one, the disappearance of interference is explained - both when the
detection succeeds and when it doesn't. Also a definite prediction is made,
when the inter-slit distance is reduced, of where the first signs of
interference should appear on the detection screen.

parameters by observations is considered. The only general method of this kind
is the root model based on the representation of the probability density as a
squared absolute value of a certain function, which is referred to as a
psi-function in analogy with quantum mechanics. The psi-function is represented
by an expansion in terms of an orthonormal set of functions. It is shown that
the introduction of the psi-function allows one to represent the Fisher
information matrix as well as statistical properties of the estimator of the
state vector (state estimator) in simple analytical forms. A new statistical
characteristic, a confidence cone, is introduced instead of a standard
confidence interval. The chi-square test is considered to test the hypotheses
that the estimated vector converges to the state vector of a general population
and that both samples are homogeneous. The expansion coefficients are estimated
by the maximum likelihood method. The method proposed may be applied to its
full extent to solve the statistical inverse problem of quantum mechanics (root
estimator of quantum states). In order to provide statistical completeness of
the analysis, it is necessary to perform measurements in mutually complementing
experiments (according to the Bohr terminology). The maximum likelihood
technique and likelihood equation are generalized in order to analyze quantum
mechanical experiments. It is shown that the requirement for the expansion to
be of a root kind can be considered as a quantization condition making it
possible to choose systems described by quantum mechanics from all statistical
models consistent, on average, with the laws of classical mechanics.

innermost regions of classical T Tauri disks. In almost all cases, the shape of
the excess is consistent with that of a single-temperature blackbody with T ~
1400 K, similar to the expected dust sublimation temperature for typical dust
compositions. The amount of excess flux roughly correlates with the accretion
luminosity in objects with similar stellar properties. We compare our
observations with the predictions of simple disk models having an inner rim
located at the dust sublimation radius, including irradiation heating of the
dust from both the stellar and accretion luminosities. The models yield inner
rim radii in the range 0.07-0.54 AU, increasing with higher stellar and
accretion luminosities. Using typical parameters which fit our observed sample,
we predict a rim radius ~ 0.2 AU for the T Tauri star DG Tau, which agrees with
recent Keck near-infrared interferometric measurements. For large mass
accretion rates, the inner rim lies beyond the corotation radius at (or within)
which magnetospheric accretion flows are launched, which implies that pure
gaseous disks must extend inside the dust rim. Thus, for a significant fraction
of young stars, dust cannot exist in the innermost disk, calling into question
theories in which solid particles are ejected by a wind originating at the
magnetospheric radius.

universe. SMBHs with ~ 10^9 solar masses must have formed by z > 6, or within
10^9 yrs after the Big Bang, to power quasars. It may be difficult for gas
accretion to build up such a SMBH by this time unless the initial seed black
hole already has a substantial mass. One plausible progenitor of a massive seed
black hole is a supermassive star (SMS). We have followed the collapse of a SMS
to a SMBH by means of 3D hydrodynamic simulations in post-Newtonian gravity and
axisymmetric simulations in full general relativity. The initial SMS of
arbitrary mass M in these simulations rotates uniformly at the mass--shedding
limit and is marginally unstable to radial collapse. The final black hole mass
and spin are determined to be M_h/M ~ 0.9 and J_h/M_h^2 ~ 0.75. The remaining
mass goes into a disk of mass M_{disk}/M ~ 0.1. This disk arises even though
the total spin of the progenitor star, J/M^2 = 0.97, is safely below the Kerr
limit. The collapse generates a mild burst of gravitational radiation.
Nonaxisymmetric bars or one-armed spirals may arise during the quasi-stationary
evolution of a SMS, during its collapse, or in the ambient disk about the hole,
and are potential sources of quasi-periodic waves, detectable by LISA.

generally Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and may also be Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable.
Because of these instabilities, modes with low azimuthal wavenumbers m are
expected to grow to large amplitude. It is proposed that the resulting
nonaxisymmetric structures contribute to the high frequency quasi-periodic
oscillations that have been seen in neutron-star and black-hole X-ray binaries.
The mode oscillation frequencies are calculated to be approximately equal to m
\Omega_m, where \Omega_m is the angular velocity of the accreting gas at the
magnetospheric radius. Thus, mode frequencies should often be in the
approximate ratio 1:2:3, etc. If the pressure of the gas in the disk is not
large, then the m = 1 mode will be stable. In this case, the mode frequencies

black hole binary with superluminal jet, XTE J1550-564, acquired during its
1999--2000 outburst. The X-ray spectra show features typical of the high/soft
spectral state, and can approximately be described by an optically thick disk
spectrum plus a power-law tail. Three distinct spectral regimes, named standard
regime, anomalous regime, and apparently standard regime, have been found from
the entire set of the observed spectra. When the X-ray luminosity is well below
6E38 erg/s (assuming a distance of 5 kpc), XTE J1550-564 resides in the
standard regime, where the soft spectral component dominates the power-law
component and the observed disk inner radius is kept constant. When the
luminosity exceeds the critical luminosity, the apparently standard regime is
realized, where luminosity of the optically thick disk rises less steeply with
the temperature, and the spectral shape is moderately distorted from that of
the standard accretion disk. In this regime, radial temperature gradient of the
disk has been found to be flatter than that of the standard accretion disk. The
results of the apparently standard regime are suggestive of a slim disk (e.g.,
Abramowicz et al. 1988, Watarai et al. 2000) which is a solution predicted
under high mass accretion rate. In the intermediate anomalous regime, the
spectrum becomes much harder, and the disk inner radius derived using a simple
disk model spectrum apparently varies significantly with time. These properties
can be explained as a result of significant thermal inverse Comptonization of
the disk photons, as was found from GRO J1655-40 in its anomalous regime by
Kubota, Makishima and Ebisawa (2001).

Observatory (ISO) satellite has allowed for the first time to investigate the
whole far infrared (FIR) part of the spectrum (from 43 to 197 um), inaccessible
from the ground. The FIR spectrum is crucial for the study of the early phases
of protostellar evolution since the peak of the continuum emission of the
protostars falls around 100 um and many molecular species emit in this range.
In this paper we review the main results of the spectroscopic observations
carried out with the LWS on a sample of pre-Main Sequence objects in different
evolutionary stages. The FIR spectra are characterized by a strong continuum
with superimposed atomic and molecular emission lines. The fine structure lines
emitted by the OI and CII atoms are present in all the objects of our sample
while emission from molecular species (CO, H_2O and OH) dominate the spectrum
of the younger and more embedded objects; lines of highly ionized atoms (OIII,
NIII, NII) are present only in high luminosity sources. We will show how both
the FIR continuum and the emission lines are powerful indicators of the
evolutionary status of young embedded objects. The analysis of the LWS spectra
has allowed to study only the average properties of the young stellar objects,
due to the large field of view (~ 80 arcsec), the limited sensitivity and the
poor spectral resolution (~ 200) of the instrument in its grating mode. The
higher spatial and spectral resolutions of the instruments on board the
Herschel satellite will allow to address in deeper detail the scientific
problems highlighted by the ISO results.

variable that erupted in 1994. Its rapid, post-outburst evolution to a cool M
type giant/supergiant, soon after its outburst, had showed that it was an
unusual object differing from other eruptive variables like classical/symbiotic
novae or born-again AGB stars. The present study of V4332 Sgr was motivated by
the keen interest in the recent eruption of V838 Mon - which along with V4332
Sgr - is believed to belong to a new class of objects (we propose they may be
called ""quasi-novae""). Our observations show new developments in the evolution
of V4332 Sgr. The most striking feature is the detection of several molecular
bands of AlO - a rarely seen molecule in astronomical spectra - in the JHK
spectra. Many of these bands are being detected for the first time. The only
other detection of some of these AlO bands are in V838 Mon, thereby showing
further spectral similarities between the two objects. JHK photometry shows the
development of a new dust shell around V4332 Sgr with a temperature of ~ 900K.
This dust shell does not appear to be associated with ejecta of the 1994
outburst but is due to a second mass-loss episode which is not expected in a
classical nova outburst. The cold molecular environment, suggested by the AlO
emission, is also not expected in novae ejecta. We model the AlO bands and also
discuss the possible formation mechanism of the AlO.

estimated from the radial velocity dispersion is larger than the cluster
luminous mass, which may be explained by a combination of the optically thick
interstellar cloud that occults part of the cluster, the unbound state or
undetected very wide binary orbit of some of the members that inflate the
velocity dispersion and a high inclination for the axis of a possible cluster

(P=2.48%). Intrinsic polarization up to 0.7% at 5000 A is present during the
second maximum of the object (February 2002). This intrinsic component
increases toward shorter wavelengths but our limited spectral coverage
(5000-7500 A) does not allow conclusive inferences about its origin. A strong
depolarization across the Halpha profile is observed. The interstellar
polarization gives a lower limit to the reddening of E(B-V)>0.28, with

part of the fine structure (so-called even-a coefficients). We consider the
near-surface, small-scale magnetic and turbulent velocity fields, as well as
horizontal magnetic fields buried near the base of the convective zone. For the
centroids we also discuss the effect of temperature variation. We demonstrate
that there is a full, one-to-one correspondence between the expansion
coefficients of the fine structure and those of both the averaged small-scale
velocity and magnetic fields. Measured changes in the centroid frequencies and
the even-a's over the rising phase solar cycle may be accounted for by a
decrease in the turbulent velocity of order 1%. We show that the mean
temperature decrease associated with the net decrease in the efficiency of
convective transport may also significantly contribute to the increase of the
centroid frequencies. Alternatively, the increase may be accounted for by an
increase of the small-scale magnetic field of order 100 G, if the growing field
is predominantly radial. We also show that global seismology can be used to
detect a field at the level of a few times 10^5 G, if such a field were present

fit by a log-normal distribution of intrinsic ellipticities with ln epsilon =

Andersen and Bershady using both photometric and spectroscopic data, the best

inertial-vortex forces of the eddies are larger than any of the other forces
that tend to damp the eddies out. Energy cascades of irrotational flows from
large scales to small are non-turbulent, even if they supply energy to
turbulence. Turbulent flows are rotational and cascade from small scales to
large, with feedback. Viscous forces limit the smallest turbulent eddy size to
the Kolmogorov scale. In stratified fluids, buoyancy forces limit large
vertical overturns to the Ozmidov scale and convert the largest turbulent
eddies into a unique class of saturated, non-propagating, internal waves,
termed fossil-vorticity-turbulence. These waves have the same energy but
different properties and spectral forms than the original turbulence patch. The
Gibson (1980, 1986) theory of fossil turbulence applies universal similarity
theories of turbulence and turbulent mixing to the vertical evolution of an
isolated patch of turbulence in a stratified fluid as its growth is constrained
and fossilized by buoyancy forces. These theories apply to the dynamics of

(purely interaction originated) defined from the excitation spectrum and
obtained for various even- as well as odd-fractions exhibits a curious,
step-like filling dependence basically determined by the number of flux quanta
attached to each fermion, where the non-monotonic behaviour indicates a strong
effect of gauge-field fluctuations. The excitation spectrum fits a Fermi
liquid, but again a large effect of inter-composite fermion interaction appears
as anomalous Landau's parameters. We have then moved on to see how the
introduction of three-dimensionality (where the shape of the Fermi surface
becomes relevant) affects the interacting electron system, and propose the
magnetic-field induced SDW in three-dimensional systems. This should be a good
candidate, in entirely realistic magnetic fields, for the integer QHE recently
predicted by Koshino et al to occur in 3D on the fractal energy spectrum
similar to Hofstadter's. The mechanism for the field-induced phase is an effect
of interaction in Landau's quantisation on incompletely-nested (i.e.,

the magnetic quantisation on various Fermi surfaces may provide an interesting

the interstitial channels (between three carbon nanotubes) within a bundle of
many nanotubes. The effects on adsorption of a nonuniform distribution of tubes
are evaluated. The energy of a single particle state is the sum of a discrete
transverse energy Et (that depends on the radii of neighboring tubes) and a
quasicontinuous energy Ez of relatively free motion parallel to the axis of the
tubes. At low temperature, the particles occupy the lowest energy states, the
focus of this study. The transverse energy attains a global minimum value
(Et=Emin) for radii near Rmin=9.95 Ang. for H2 and 8.48 Ang.for He-4. The
density of states N(E) near the lowest energy is found to vary linearly above
this threshold value, i.e. N(E) is proportional to (E-Emin). As a result, there
occurs a Bose-Einstein condensation of the molecules into the channel with the
lowest transverse energy. The transition is characterized approximately as that
of a four dimensional gas, neglecting the interactions between the adsorbed
particles. The phenomenon is observable, in principle, from a singular heat
capacity. The existence of this transition depends on the sample having a
relatively broad distribution of radii values that include some near Rmin.

unequal, time-varying, and (due to aberration) have different time delays on
up- and down-links. Reduction of data from moving interferometric laser arrays
in solar orbit will in fact encounter non-symmetric up- and downlink light time
differences that are about 100 times larger than has previously been
recognized. The time-delay interferometry (TDI) technique uses knowledge of
these delays to cancel the otherwise dominant laser phase noise and yields a
variety of data combinations sensitive to gravitational waves. Under the
assumption that the (different) up- and downlink time delays are constant, we
derive the TDI expressions for those combinations that rely only on four
inter-spacecraft phase measurements. We then turn to the general problem that
encompasses time-dependence of the light-travel times along the laser links. By
introducing a set of non-commuting time-delay operators, we show that there
exists a quite general procedure for deriving generalized TDI combinations that
account for the effects of time-dependence of the arms. By applying our
approach we are able to re-derive the ``flex-free'' expression for the

obtain the generalized expressions for the TDI combinations called Relay,

of the parameters of the source. We have tested and compared different versions

observed strangeness hadronic phase space under-saturation. We show that, in
this energy range, the use of hadron yields at midrapidity instead of in full
phase space artificially enhances strangeness production and could lead to
incorrect conclusions as far as the occurrence of full chemical equilibrium is
concerned. In addition to the basic model with an extra strange quark
non-equilibrium parameter, we have tested three more schemes: a two-component
model superimposing hadrons coming out of single nucleon-nucleon interactions
to those emerging from large fireballs at equilibrium, a model with local
strangeness neutrality and a model with strange and light quark non-equilibrium
parameters. The behaviour of the source parameters as a function of colliding
system and collision energy is studied. The description of strangeness

multiplication on a prescribed row vector, gives another prescribed row vector
(resp. when multiplied at left and right by prescribed row and column vectors,
gives a prescribed scalar). We show that over any semiring, scalar reachability
reduces to vector reachability which is equivalent to matrix reachability, and
that for any of these problems, the specialization to any $r\geq 2$ is
equivalent to the specialization to $r=2$. As an application of this result and
of a theorem of Krob, we show that when $r=2$, the vector and matrix

empirical coefficients fixed by subthreshold $\pi N$ data. In this sense, the
calculation has no adjusted parameters and gives rise to predictions, which are
tested against phenomenological potentials. The dynamical structure of the
eight leading non-relativistic components of the interaction is investigated
and, in most cases, found to be clearly dominated by a well defined class of
diagrams. In particular, the central isovector and spin-orbit, spin-spin, and
tensor isoscalar terms are almost completely fixed by just $g_A$ and $f_{\pi}$.
The convergence of the chiral series in powers of the ratio (pion mass/nucleon
mass) is studied as a function of the internucleon distance and, for $r>$ 1 fm,
found to be adequate for most components of the potential. An important
exception is the dominant central isoscalar term, where the convergence is
evident only for $r>$ 2.5 fm. Finally, we compare the spatial behavior of the

from the genuine correlation among a large number of particles. Anisotropic
flow is obtained from the zeroes in the complex plane of a generating function
of azimuthal correlations, in close analogy with the theory of phase
transitions by Lee and Yang. Flow is first estimated globally, i.e., averaged
over the phase space covered by the detector, and then differentially, as a
function of transverse momentum and rapidity for identified particles. The
corresponding estimates are less biased by nonflow correlations than with any
other method. The practical implementation of the method is rather
straightforward. Furthermore, it automatically takes into account most
corrections due to azimuthal anisotropies in the detector acceptance. The main
limitation of the method is statistical errors, which can be significantly
larger than with the ``standard'' method of flow analysis if the flow and/or
the event multiplicities are too small. In practice, we expect this to be the
most accurate method to analyze directed and elliptic flow in fixed-target
heavy-ion collisions between 100 MeV and 10 GeV per nucleon (at the Darmstadt
SIS synchrotron and the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron), and
elliptic flow at ultrarelativistic energies (at the Brookhaven Relativistic

61, 68, 75, 79, 86, 100 and 102, of which only the sizes 38, 75, 79, 86, and
102 are pure FCC clusters, the others having stacking faults. A connection
between the model potential and density functional calculations is studied in
the case of Al_100. The density functional calculations are consistent with the
experimental fact that there exist epitaxially grown FCC clusters starting from
relatively small cluster sizes. Calculations also show that several other
close-packed motifs existwith comparable total energies.

interpretations of quantum mechanics. The aim of the current paper is to
explore their meanings within a certain neo-Everettian many worlds
interpretation. We will also look at questions that have been linked with the
uncertainty relations since Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: those of joint
and repeated measurement of non-commuting (or otherwise `incompatible')
observables. This will have implications beyond the uncertainty relations, as
we will see the fundamentally different way in which statistical statements are
interpreted in the neo-Everett theory that we use.

encoded into Hyperfine states of ions held in a linear array of individually
tailored microtraps and sitting in a spatially varying magnetic field. The
magnetic field gradient introduces spatially dependent qubit transition
frequencies and a type of spin-spin interaction between qubits. Single and
multi-qubit manipulation is achieved via resonant microwave pulses as in
liquid-NMR quantum computation while the qubit readout and reset is achieved
through trapped-ion fluorescence shelving techniques. By adjusting the
microtrap configurations we can tailor, in hardware, the qubit resonance
frequencies and coupling strengths. We show the system possesses a side-band
transition structure which does not scale with the size of the processor
allowing scalable frequency discrimination between qubits. By using large
magnetic field gradients, one can readout and reset the qubits in the ion chain
via frequency selective optical pulses avoiding the need for many tightly
focused laser beams for spatial qubit addressing.

investigated as a possible cause of the Pauli exclusion principle. First, it is
shown that a certain class of rotationally invariant states can only occur in
pairs. This is referred to as the coupling principle. This in turn suggests a
natural classification of quantum systems into those containing coupled states
and those that do not. Surprisingly, it would seem that Fermi-Dirac statistics
follows as a consequence of this coupling while the Bose-Einstein follows by
breaking it. In section 5, the above approach is related to Pauli's original
spin-statistics theorem and finally in the last two sections, a theoretical
justification, based on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the experimental
evidence respectively, is presented.

condition for joint probability distribution of several random variables
represented as the convex sum of products of probabilities of random variables
describing the subsystems. The property is discussed as a possible criterion
for separability or entanglement. The convenient criterion of positivity of

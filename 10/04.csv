multiple line and continuum components precisely aligned with the radio
structure, including an obvious semi-circular arc. We explore the nature of
these various components by bringing together HST and ground-based imaging,
ground-based spectroscopy, and radio mapping. From plausible decompositions of
the spectra, we show that the continuum of the nuclear component is likely
dominated by a combination of nebular thermal continuum, quasar light, and
light from old stars. A component that falls directly on the probable path of
the radio jet shows mostly nebular thermal continuum and includes contributions
from a relatively young stellar population with an age around 100 Myr. The arc
appears to be completely dominated by line emission and nebular thermal
continuum, with no evidence for a significant stellar contribution. Though much
of the aligned light is in UV components, the underlying old elliptical is also
well-aligned with the radio axis. The elliptical is well-fit by a de
Vaucouleurs profile, probably has a moderately old stellar population (~3 Gyr),
and is a massive system with a velocity dispersion of sigma ~ 270 km/s that
implies it contains a supermassive black hole. Although the arc and the
extended emission surrounding the eastern lobe suggest that interactions
between the radio lobe and jet must have been important in creating the UV
morphology, the ionization and kinematic properties in these componentsare more
consistent with photoionization than shock excitation. 3C280 may be a
transition object between the compact steep-spectrum radio galaxies which seem
to be shock-dominated, and the extended radio sources which may have evolved
past this phase and rarely show shock signatures.

Lyman-alpha fluoresced H2 lines. The HST lines are all Lyman band lines, while
the FUSE H2 lines are mostly Werner band lines, many of them never before
identified in an astrophysical spectrum. We combine the FUSE and HST data to
refine estimates of the physical properties of the emitting H2 gas. We find
that the emission can be reproduced by an H2 layer with a temperature and
column density of T=3900 K and log N(H2)=17.1, respectively. Another similarity
between the HST and FUSE data, besides the prevalence of H2 emission, is the
surprising weakness of the continuum and high temperature emission lines,
suggesting that accretion onto Mira B has weakened dramatically. The UV fluxes
observed by HST on 1999 August 2 were previously reported to be over an order
of magnitude lower than those observed by HST and the International Ultraviolet
Explorer (IUE) from 1979--1995. Analysis of the FUSE data reveals that Mira B

holes powering outflows and jets which propagate only for a short distance,
because the velocity of the ejected material is smaller than the escape
velocity. We call them ""aborted"" jets. If the central engine works
intermittently, blobs of material may be produced, which can reach a maximum
radial distance and then fall back, colliding with the blobs produced later and
still moving outwards. These collisions dissipate the bulk kinetic energy of
the blobs by heating the plasma, and can be responsible (entirely or at least
in part) for the generation of the high energy emission in radio-quiet objects.
This is alternative to the more conventional scenario in which the X-ray
spectrum of radio-quiet sources originates in a hot (and possibly patchy)
corona above the accretion disk. In the latter case the ultimate source of
energy of the emission of both the disk and the corona is accretion. Here we
instead propose that the high energy emission is powered also by the extraction
of the rotational energy of the black hole (and possibly of the disk). By means
of Montecarlo simulations we calculate the time dependent spectra and light
curves, and discuss their relevance to the X-ray spectra in radio-quiet AGNs
and galactic black hole sources. In particular, we show that time variability
and spectra are similar to those observed in Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies.

Fine Guidance Sensor, which, together with positions from the U. S. Naval
Observatory's UCAC2 catalog, allow us to register the infrared and radio frames
to an accuracy of better than 0.1 arcsec. The result is that the nuclear
compact radio source is not coincident with the brightest discrete object in
the AO image, an essentially unresolved source on the eastern side of the light
distribution, as Quirrenbach et al. (2001) had suggested. Instead, the radio
source is centered about 0.9 arcsec to the west of this object, on one of the
two apparently real peaks in a region of diffuse emission. Nevertheless, the
conclusion of Quirrenbach et al. that 3C294 involves an ongoing merger appears
to be correct: analysis of a recent deep Chandra image of 3C294 obtained from
the archive shows that the nucleus comprises two X-ray sources, which are
coincident with the radio nucleus and the eastern stellar object. The
X-ray/optical flux ratio of the latter makes it extremely unlikely that it is a

turnover in the radio continuum spectra of the two known SNRs in the field:
G11.2-0.3 and G11.4-0.1 with unprecedented precision. Such low frequency
turnovers are believed to arise from free-free absorption in ionized thermal
gas along the lines of site to the SNRs. Our data suggest that the 74 MHz
optical depths of the absorbing gas is 0.56 and 1.1 for G11.2-0.3 and
G11.4-0.1, respectively. In addition to adding much needed low frequency
integrated flux measurements for two known SNRs, we have also detected three
new SNRs: G11.15-0.71, G11.03-0.05, and G11.18+0.11. These new SNRs have
integrated spectral indices between -0.44 and -0.80. Because of confusion with
thermal sources, the high resolution (compared to previous Galactic radio
frequency surveys) and surface brightness sensitivity of our observations have
been essential to the identification of these new SNRs. With this study we have
more than doubled the number of SNRs within just a 1 deg^2 field of view in the

around IRAS2A, based on previously reported submillimeter continuum images,
down to the 3"", or 500 AU, resolution of the interferometer data. Our data
constrain the contribution of an unresolved point source to 22 mJy. Within the
accuracy of the parameters describing the envelope model, the point source flux
has an uncertainty by up to 25%. We interpret this point source as a cold disk
of mass \gtrsim 0.3 M_\odot. The same envelope model also reproduces
aperture-synthesis line observations of the optically thin isotopic species
C34S and H13CO+. The more optically thick main isotope lines show a variety of
components in the protostellar environment: N2H+ is closely correlated with
dust concentrations as seen at submillimeter wavelengths and is particularly
strong toward the starless core IRAS2C. We hypothesize that N2H+ is destroyed
through reactions with CO that is released from icy grains near the
protostellar sources IRAS2A and B. CS, HCO+, and HCN have complex line shapes
apparently affected by both outflow and infall. In addition to the east-west
jet from IRAS2A, a north-south velocity gradient near this source indicates a
second, perpendicular outflow. This suggests the presence of a binary companion
within 0.3"" (65 AU) from IRAS2A as driving source of this outflow. Alternative
explanations of the velocity gradient such as rotation in a circumstellar

The liquid-crystal 8OCB is elastically stiffer than the previously well studied
octylcyanobiphenyl (8CB)+aerosil system and so, general quenched random
disorder effects and liquid-crystal specific effects can be distinguished. A
double heat capacity feature is observed at the isotropic to nematic phase
transition with an aerosil independent overlap of the heat capacity wings far
from the transition and having a non-monotonic variation of the transition
temperature. A crossover between low and high aerosil density behavior is
observed for 8OCB+aerosil. These features are generally consistent with those
on the 8CB+aerosil system. Differences between these two systems in the
magnitude of the transition temperature shifts, heat capacity suppression, and
crossover aerosil density between the two regimes of behavior indicate a liquid
crystal specific effect. The low aerosil density regime is apparently more
orientationally disordered than the high aerosil density regime, which is more
translationally disordered. An interpretation of these results based on a
temperature dependent disorder strength is discussed. Finally, a detailed
thermal hysteresis study has found that crystallization of a well homogenized
sample perturbs and increases the disorder for low aerosil density samples but
does not influence high density samples.

considered in the mean field approximation. The ground state phase diagrams in

analytically; the number of their phases depends on the parity of the number of
layers of the film. At finite temperature, fifteen types of topology, depending
on the range of variation of $d_1$, are found in the (t,$d_2$) plane for an
even number of layers, but only fourteen for an odd number of layers. The phase
diagrams exhibit a variety of multicritical points. In particular, a
tricritical point C appears in the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic line of
transition, but only for values of $d_1$ larger than a threshold value
$d_{trc}^{(2)} ={8 \ln 2 \over 3}$ which is but the tricritical crystal field
(in the mean field approximation) of the spin-1 Blume-Capel model on a square

induced degradation of the matrix and a pronounced decrease in its molecular

involves two adjustable parameters that are found by fitting observations. With
reference to the theory of transient networks, constitutive equations are
developed for the viscoelastic response of nanocomposite melts. The
stress-strain relations are characterized by three material constants (the
shear modulus, the average energy for rearrangement of strands and the standard
deviation of activation energies) that are determined by matching the
dependencies of storage and loss moduli on frequency of oscillations. Good
agreement is demonstrated between the experimental data and the results of

the elastic modulus and the standard deviation of activation energies linearly
increase with mass-average molecular weight.

predicts the radius of the proton correctly. The radius of the electron turns
out to be a surprising quantity that solves the existing problems of
electrodynamics, particularly the problem of the infinite self-force of the
electron. In addition, the classical radius of the electron (2.82fm) will prove
to be not a ""radius"", but rather the mean distance through which the retarded
potentials of the self-force act. An important conclusion is that there is no
deficiency in the classical Abraham-Lorentz model of the self-force, but rather
the problem lies with our intuitive understanding of what an elementary
particle is. Other important conclusions are also discussed, including a
physically sound explanation for why electric charges must be quantized (as

or not and making it hard to work out which forecasts are best. To remedy this
situation we describe a set of guidelines that we recommend should be followed

validation can be used directly by forecast users to make decisions about which
forecasts to use. If they are not followed then the results of validation may
be interesting, but will not be practically useful for users. We find that none

reduced density matrices for which the cat is as alive as possible for the
first state (and as dead as possible for the second state). The resulting
states are those in which the probability for the cat to be alive (or dead) is
$1/2+\sqrt 2/4\approx 0.854$

bipartite pure states, to mixed states by means of the convex-roof extension.
We show that the measure does not increase under local quantum operations and
classical communication, and derive explicit formulae for the entanglement
measure of isotropic states and Werner states, applying the formalism presented
by Vollbrecht and Werner [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 64}, 062307 (2001)].

freedom which depends on one random variable, analogous to center of mass
considered in rotated and scaled reference frame in the phase space, is
constructed. Time evolution equation of the tomogram for this map is given in
explicit form. Properties of the map like the transition probabilities between
the different states and relation to the star product formalism are elucidated.
Example of multimode oscillator is considered in details. Symmetry properties
in respect to identical particles permutations are discussed in the framework
of proposed tomography scheme.

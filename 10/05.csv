hydrodynamical calculations of the blob of gas associated with the jet
producing a gamma-ray burst. We investigate the deceleration phase of the blob
corresponding to the time when afterglow radiation is produced, concentrating
on the transition in which the relativistic beaming 1/gamma goes from being
less than theta, where gamma is the bulk Lorentz factor and theta is the
angular width of the jet, to 1/gamma > theta. We study the time dependent
evolution of the physical parameters associated with the jet, both parallel to
the direction of motion and perpendicular to it. We calculate light curves for
observers at varying angles with respect to the velocity vector of the blob,
assuming optically thin emission that scales with the local pressure. Our main
findings are that (i) gas ahead of the advancing blob does not accrete onto and
merge with the blob material but rather flows around the blob, (ii) the decay
light curve steepens at a time corresponding roughly to 1/gamma equals theta
(in accord with earlier studies), and (iii) the rate of decrease of the forward
component of momentum in the blob is well-fit by a simple model in which the
gas in front of the blob exerts a drag force on the blob, and the cross
sectional area of the blob increases quadratically with laboratory time (or
distance).

angular clustering parameters, including a steep slope for the clustering

of clustering properties on radio frequency. It is important to incorporate the

  A very different kind of massive computation has had the same effect at the

performed by a graphics card. The operations themselves are very simple, and
require very little memory, but require the ability to perform many
computations extremely fast and in parallel to whatever degree possible. What
has resulted is a stream processor that is highly optimized for stream
computations. An intriguing side effect of this is the growing use of a

performing a computation on a graphics card is far faster than performing it on
a CPU, and so are using a GPU as a stream co-processor.

singularity ``big bang'' could be replaced by a matter singularity ``big
bounce'', at which the ``size'' of the universe and the energy density are
finite while the pressure diverges, and across which the universe evolves from
a pre-existing contracting phase to the present expanding phase. It is also

particles on the brane may become unstable in the sense that they may escape

sub-optimal among all possible input-output schemes, provide a global noise
suppression by the power squeeze factor, while being realizable by using
detuned Fabry-Perot cavities as input/output filters. At high frequencies, the
two schemes are shown to be equivalent, while at low frequencies our scheme
gives better performance than that of Harms et al., and is nearly fully
optimal. We then study the sensitivity improvement achievable by these schemes
in Advanced LIGO era (with 30-m filter cavities and current estimates of
filter-mirror losses and thermal noise), for neutron star binary inspirals, and
for narrowband GW sources such as low-mass X-ray binaries and known radio
pulsars. Optical losses are shown to be a major obstacle for the actual

waves over one-dimensional periodic and random bottoms is investigated by the
transfer matrix method. The results indicate that the range of localization in
random bottoms can be coincident with the band gaps for the corresponding
periodic bottoms. Inside the gap or localization regime, a collective behavior
of water waves appears. The results are also compared with acoustic and optical
situations.

Eucilidean space and proves the weak convergence of their rescaled n-step
densities. One of the examples is called the Plancherel quantum walk because
the ""quantum coin flip"" is the Fourier Integral (or Plancherel) Transform. The
other examples are the Birkhoff quantum walks, so named because the coin flips
are effected by means of measure preserving transformations to which the
Birkhoff's Ergodic Theorem is applied.

fit experimentally obtained data to appropriately chosen trial functions with
high probability. Modulo constants pertaining to the reliability and
probability of success of the algorithm, the algorithm runs using only
O(polylog(|Y|)) queries to the quantum database and O(polylog(|X|,|Y|))
elementary quantum gates where |X| is the size of the experimental data set and
|Y| is the size of the parameter space.We discuss heuristics for good
performance, analyze the performance of the algorithm in the case of linear
regression, both one-dimensional and multidimensional, and outline the
algorithm's limitations.

Lett 93, 086402 (2004)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.086402",,"quant-ph",,"  The local entanglement $E_v$ of the one-dimensional Hubbard model is studied
on the basis of its Bethe-ansatz solution. The relationship between the local
entanglement and the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$ is obtained. Our results
show that $E_v$ is an even analytic function of $U$ at half-filling and it
reaches a maximum at the critical point U=0. The variation of the local
entanglement with the filling factor shows that the ground state with maximal
symmetry possesses maximal entanglement. The magnetic field makes the local
entanglement to decrease and approach to zero at saturated magnetization. The
on-site Coulomb interaction always suppresses the local entanglement.

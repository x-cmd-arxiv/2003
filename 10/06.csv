evident. The dips define the orbital period of the system, and using a power
spectral analysis and a cycle counting technique we derive an accurate period
of P_orb = 5.16 +/- 0.01 hr. The previously-reported candidate period of
5.73$\pm$0.15 hr, obtained using Ginga data, is inconsistent with our

of the source during that observation. The dips in the RXTE observations
presented here do not align with the Ginga period, however our improved period
is consistent with a wide range of archival data.

Faraday rotation and depolarization. The one-dimensional second order structure

indicative of a gradient or large filament across the field. The shallow slope
can be explained by contributions of two separated Faraday screens. Assuming
that the two Faraday screens are the local and Carina spiral arms, the
structure function suggests an outer scale of structure in the local arm of
about 2 pc. This scale is similar to the typical scale of a Stroemgren sphere
of a B1-2 star. Therefore, we suggest that HII regions possibly dominate the

numerical results show that CO white dwarfs can accrete sufficient mass to
evolve to a Type Ia supernova and ONeMg white dwarfs can be built up to undergo
accretion induced collapse for donors more massive than about 2 Msun. For
donors less massive than ~2 Msun the system can evolve to form a He and CO or

month after light from UTs was first combined for interferometric fringes. In
addition, we sampled the visibility function at small spatial frequencies using
the 40cm test siderostats. Our measurement constrains the diameter of the star

z_p~2.9-3.0. All three galaxies have already assembled a stellar mass of about
10^{11} M_sun at the observed redshift placing the possible merging event of

mass and that they cannot follow an evolution significantly different from a
passive aging.The comparison with the density of local L>L* early types

halves of the galaxy. The optical emission is lopsided with respect to the HI,
most of the bright optical emission arises from the eastern half of the HI
disk. The velocity field of the galaxy is however quite regular and shows a
systematic large scale pattern, consistent with the rotational motion. The
rotation curve for the galaxy shows a peak (inclination corrected) rotation
velocity of only ~8 km/s, comparable to the random motions in the HI gas. After
correcting for the dynamical support provided by random motions (the
``asymmetric drift'' correction), we find the corrected peak rotation velocity
of ~16.0 km/s. Mass modeling of the corrected rotation curve shows that the
kinematics of DDO210 can be well fit with either a modified isothermal halo

a galaxy depend only on the mass of its dark matter halo. An important
consequence of this is that the segregation of the galaxy population by
large-scale environment is entirely due to the environmental dependence of the
halo population. In this paper we use such a model to predict how the galaxy
luminosity function depends on large-scale environment. The latter is
represented by the density contrast (delta) averaged over a spherical volume of
radius R=8Mpc/h. The model predicts that the Schechter function is a good
approximation to the luminosity functions of galaxies brighter than ~10^9
h^{-2}L_sun (b_j-band) in virtually all environments. The characteristic
luminosity, L^{\star}, increases moderately with \delta. The faint-end slope,
\alpha, on the other hand, is quite independent of $\delta$. However, when
splitting the galaxy population into early and late types, it is found that for
late-types \alpha is virtually constant, whereas for early-types \alpha
increases from ~-0.3 in underdense regions (\delta~-0.5) to ~-0.8 in highly
overdense regions with \delta ~ 10. The luminosity function at L_{b_j}<10^9
h^{-2} L_sun is significantly steeper than the extrapolation of the Schechter
function that fits the brighter galaxies. This steepening is more significant
for early-types and in low-density environments. The model also predicts that
the luminosity density and mass density are closely correlated. The relation
between the two is monotonic but highly non-linear. This suggests that one can
use the luminosity density, averaged over a large volume, to rank the mass
density. This, in turn, allows the environmental effects predicted here to be
tested by observations.

response of a resonant tunneling system. We use a \textit{partition-free}
approach by Cini in which the whole system is in equilibrium before an external
bias is switched on. No fictitious partitions are used. Besides the
steady-state responses one can also calculate physical dynamical responses. In
the noninteracting case we clarify under what circumstances a steady-state
current develops and compare our result with the one obtained in the
partitioned scheme. We prove a Theorem of asymptotic Equivalence between the
two schemes for arbitrary time-dependent disturbances. We also show that the
steady-state current is independent of the history of the external perturbation
(Memory Loss Theorem). In the so called wide-band limit an analytic result for
the time-dependent current is obtained. In the interacting case we propose an
exact non-equilibrium Green function approach based on Time Dependent Density
Functional Theory. The equations are no more difficult than an ordinary Mean
Field treatment. We show how the scattering-state scheme by Lang follows from
our formulation. An exact formula for the steady-state current of an arbitrary
interacting resonant tunneling system is obtained. As an example the
time-dependent current response is calculated in the Random Phase

the third post-Newtonian (3 PN) approximation of general relativity. The strong
field point particle limit and multipole expansion of the stars are used to
solve iteratively the harmonically relaxed Einstein equations. We take into
account the Lorentz contraction on the multipole moments defined in our
previous works. We then derive a 3 PN acceleration of the binary orbital motion
of the two spherical compact stars based on a surface integral approach which
is a direct consequence of local energy momentum conservation. Our resulting
equation of motion admits a conserved energy (neglecting the 2.5 PN radiation
reaction effect), is Lorentz invariant and is unambiguous: there exist no
undetermined parameter reported in the previous works. We shall show that our 3
PN equation of motion agrees physically with the Blanchet and Faye 3 PN
equation of motion if $\lambda = - 1987/3080$, where $\lambda$ is the parameter
which is undetermined within their framework. This value of $\lambda$ is
consistent with the result of Damour, Jaranowski, and Sch\""afer who first
completed a 3 PN iteration of the ADM Hamiltonian in the ADMTT gauge using the
dimensional regularization.

equation of state $P=(\Gamma-1)\rho\epsilon$ is adopted, where $P$, $\rho$,
$\varep$, and $\Gamma$ are the pressure, rest mass density, specific internal
energy, and the adiabatic constant, respectively. We take $\Gamma=2$ and the
baryon rest-mass ratio $Q_M$ to be in the range 0.85--1. The typical grid size
is $(633,633,317)$ for $(x,y,z)$ . We improve several implementations since the
latest work. In the present code, the radiation reaction of gravitational waves
is taken into account with a good accuracy. This fact enables us to follow the
coalescence all the way from the late inspiral phase through the merger phase
for which the transition is triggered by the radiation reaction. It is found
that if the total rest-mass of the system is more than $\sim 1.7$ times of the
maximum allowed rest-mass of spherical neutron stars, a black hole is formed
after the merger irrespective of the mass ratios. The gravitational waveforms
and outcomes in the merger of unequal-mass binaries are compared with those in
equal-mass binaries. It is found that the disk mass around the so formed black
holes increases with decreasing rest-mass ratios and decreases with increasing
compactness of neutron stars. The merger process and the gravitational
waveforms also depend strongly on the rest-mass ratios even for the range $Q_M=
0.85$--1.

term described by a second-rank symmetric tensor $\Lambda^{\mu}_{\nu}$ whose
asymptotics are Einstein cosmological term $\Lambda \delta ^{\mu}_{\nu}$ at the
origin and $\lambda \delta ^{\mu}_{\nu}$ at infinity (with $\lambda <

  It corresponds to extension of the algebraic structure of the Einstein
cosmological term $\Lambda \delta ^{\mu}_{\nu}$ in such a way that a scalar
$\Lambda$ describing vacuum energy density as $\rho_{vac}=8\pi G \Lambda$ (with
$\rho_{vac}$=const by virtue of the Bianchi identities), becomes explicite
related to the appropriate component, $\Lambda^0_0$, of an appropriate
stress-energy tensor, $T^{\mu}_{\nu}=8\pi G\Lambda^{\mu}_{\nu}$ whose vacuum
properties follow from its symmetry, $T_0^0=T_1^1$, and whose variability
follows from the contracted Bianchi identities. In the spherically symmetric
case existence of such geometries in frame of GR follows from imposing on
Einstein equations requirements of finiteness of the ADM mass $m$, and of
regularity of density and pressures. Dependently on parameters $m$ and
$q=\sqrt{\Lambda /\lambda}$, $\Lambda^{\mu}_{\nu}$ geometry describes five
types of configurations. We summarize here the results which tell us how these
configurations look from the point of view of different observers: a static
observer, a Lemaitre co-moving observer, and a Kantowski-Sachs observer.

multi-connected, planar fluid regions which are ``stirred'' by the moving

implies that if the initial vorticity of such a flow is generic among
real-valued functions in the $C^k$-topology ($k \geq 2$) or is $C^\omega$ and
nonconstant, then the flow has zero topological entropy. On the other hand, it
is shown that for constant initial vorticity there are stirring protocols which
always yield time-periodic Euler flows with positive entropy. These protocols
are those that generate flow maps in pseudoAnosov isotopy classes. These
classes are a basic ingredient of the Thurston-Nielsen theory and a further
application of that theory shows that pseudoAnosov stirring protocols with
generic initial vorticity always yield solutions to Euler's equations for which
the sup norm of the gradient of the vorticity grows exponentially in time. In
particular, such Euler flows are never time-periodic.

upper limit on the permanent of a form similar to Bregman's Theorem. For a
graph with $2n$ nodes where the degree of every node is nearly $\gamma n$ for a
constant $\gamma$, the expected running time is $O(n^{1.5 + .5/\gamma})$. Under
these conditions, Jerrum and Sinclair showed that a Markov chain of Broder can
generate approximately uniform variates in $\Theta(n^{4.5 + .5/\gamma} \ln n)$

we show that the identity component of the automorphism group of $T^rX$ is
isomorphic to the identity component of the isometry group of $X$ provided that

the activation of a diverse set of genes. Many of the same genes are induced in
the defense responses of a wide range of plant species. How plant defense gene
families evolve may therefore provide an important clue to our understanding of
how disease resistance evolves. Because studies usually focus on a single host
species, little data are available regarding changes in defense gene expression
patterns as species diverge. The expression of defense-induced genes PR10,
chitinase and chalcone synthase was assayed in four pea species (Pisum sativum,
P. humile, P. elatius and P. fulvum) and two Lathyrus species (L. sativus and
L. tingitanus) which exhibited a range of infection phenotypes with Fusarium
solani . In P. sativum, resistance was accompanied by a strong induction of
defense genes at 8 hr. post-inoculation. Weaker induction was seen in
susceptible interactions in wild species. Divergence in the timing of PR10
expression was most striking between P. sativum and its closest realtive, P.
humile. Two members of this multigene family, designated PR10.1 and PR10.2, are
strongly-expressed in response to Fusarium, while the PR10.3 gene is more
weakly expressed, among Pisum species. The rapidity with which PR10 expression
evolves raises the question, is divergence of defense gene expression a part of
the phenotypic diversity underlying plant/pathogen coevolution?

paper we present a simple identity which captures the trade-off between
entanglement and classical correlation, which can be used to derive rigorous
monogamy relations.
  We also prove various other trade-offs of a monogamy nature for other
entanglement measures and secret and total correlation measures.

decay of a quantum map under perturbation using a single bit of quantum
information. Our algorithm scales only as the complexity of the map under
investigation, so for those maps admitting an efficient gate decomposition, it
provides an exponential speed up over known classical procedures. Fidelity
decay is important in the study of complex dynamical systems, where it is
conjectured to be a signature of quantum chaos. Our result also illustrates the
role of chaos in the process of decoherence.

chain in which the spins cannot be individually accessed. The methods presented
detect entangled states close to a cluster state and a many-body singlet state,
and seem to be viable for experimental realization in optical lattices of
two-state bosonic atoms. The entanglement criteria are based on entanglement
witnesses and on the uncertainty of collective observables.

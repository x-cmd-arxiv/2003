constrain cosmological parameters and the equation of state of dark energy. Our
analysis uses the full information at the two- and three-point level from
angular scales of a few degrees to 5 arcminutes (50 < l < 3000), which will be
probed by lensing surveys. We use all triangle configurations, cross-power
spectra and bispectra constructed from up to three redshift bins with
photometric redshifts, and relevant covariances in our analysis.
  We find that the parameter constraints from bispectrum tomography are
comparable to those from power spectrum tomography. Combining the two improves
parameter accuracies by a factor of three due to their complementarity. For the
dark energy parameterization w(a) = w0 + wa(1-a), the marginalized errors from
lensing alone are sigma(w0) = 0.03 fsky^{-1/2} and sigma(wa) = 0.1 fsky^{-1/2}.
We show that these constraints can be further improved when combined with
measurements of the cosmic microwave background or Type Ia supernovae. The
amplitude and shape of the mass power spectrum are also shown to be precisely
constrained. We use hyper-extended perturbation theory to compute the nonlinear
lensing bispectrum for dark energy models. Accurate model predictions of the
bispectrum in the moderately nonlinear regime, calibrated with numerical
simulations, will be needed to realize the parameter accuracy we have
estimated. Finally, we estimate how well the lensing bispectrum can constrain a
model with primordial non-Gaussianity.

galaxies by using a GRAPE-SPH code that includes various physical processes
associated with the formation of stellar systems: radiative cooling, star
formation, feedback from Type II and Ia supernovae and stellar winds, and
chemical enrichment. In our CDM-based scenario, galaxies form through the
successive merging of sub-galaxies with various masses. Their merging histories
vary between a major merger at one extreme, and a monolithic collapse of a
slow-rotating gas cloud at the other extreme. The basic processes driving the
evolution of the metallicity gradients are as follows: i) destruction by
mergers to an extent dependent on the progenitor mass ratio. ii) regeneration
when strong central star formation is induced at a rate dependent on the gas
mass of the secondary. iii) slow evolution as star formation is induced in the
outer regions through late gas accretion. We succeed in reproducing the
observed variety of the radial metallicity gradients. The average gradient dlog
Z/dlog r ~ -0.3 with dispersion of +- 0.2 and no correlation between gradient
and galaxy mass are consistent with observations of Mg2 gradients. The variety
of the gradients stems from the difference in the merging histories. Galaxies
that form monolithically have steeper gradients, while galaxies that undergo
major mergers have shallower gradients. Thus merging histories can, in
principle, be inferred from the observed metallicity gradients of present-day
galaxies. The observed variation in the metallicity gradients cannot be
explained by either monolithic collapse or by major merger alone. Rather it
requires a model in which both formation processes arise, such as the present
CDM scheme.

circumstantial evidence for the presence of massive planets at large (several
tens of au) orbital radii, where the timescale for planet formation via core
accretion is prohibitively long. Here, we investigate whether a population of
distant planets can be produced via outward migration subsequent to formation
in the inner disc. Two possibilities for significant outward migration are
identified. First, cores that form early at radii of around 10 au can be
carried to larger radii via gravitational interaction with the gaseous disc.
This process is efficient if there is strong mass loss from the disc - either
within a cluster or due to photoevaporation from a star more massive than the
Sun - but does not require the extremely destructive environment found, for
example, in the core of the Orion Nebula. We find that, depending upon the disc
model, gas disc migration can yield massive planets (several Jupiter masses) at
radii of around 20-50 au. Second, interactions within multiple planet systems
can drive the outer planet into a large, normally highly eccentric orbit. A
series of scattering experiments suggests that this process is most efficient
for lower mass planets within systems of unequal mass ratio. This mechanism is
a good candidate for explaining the origin of relatively low mass giant planets
in eccentric orbits at large radii.

cosmic microwave background (CMB), which can be used as a direct way to measure
the energy scale of inflation. Gravitational lensing contaminates the GW signal
by converting the dominant E polarization into B polarization. By
reconstructing the lensing potential from CMB itself one can decontaminate the
B mode induced by lensing. We present results of numerical simulations of B
mode delensing using quadratic and iterative maximum-likelihood lensing
reconstruction methods as a function of detector noise and beam. In our
simulations we find the quadratic method can reduce the lensing B noise power
by up to a factor of 7, close to the no noise limit. In contrast, the iterative
method shows significant improvements even at the lowest noise levels we
tested. We demonstrate explicitly that with this method at least a factor of 40
noise power reduction in lensing induced B power is possible, suggesting that
T/S=10^-6 may be achievable in the absence of sky cuts, foregrounds, and
instrumental systematics. While we do not find any fundamental lower limit due

dominates over the detector noise.

tracers provide physical and chemical information. Five of the sources observed
were protostellar, ranging in energetics from 1 - 500L_sun, while the other two
sources were located at a shock front and within a photodissociation region
(PDR).
  Statistical equilibrium calculations were used to deduce from the measured
line strengths the physical conditions within each source and the abundance of
each molecule. In all cases except the shock and the PDR, the abundance of CO
with respect to H_2 appears significantly below (factor of ten) the general
molecular cloud value of 10^-4. {Formaldehyde measurements were used to
estimate a mean temperature and density for the gas in each source. Evidence
was found for trends between the derived abundance of CO, H_2CO, CH_3OH, and CS
and the energetics of the source, with hotter sources having higher
abundances.} Determining whether this is due to a linear progression of
abundance with temperature or sharp jumps at particular temperatures will
require more detailed modeling. The observed methanol transitions require high
temperatures (T>50 K), and thus energetic sources, within all but one of the
observed protostellar sources. The same conclusion is obtained from
observations of the CS 7-6 transition. Analysis of the HCN and HNC 4-3
transitions provides further support for high densities n> 10^7 cm^-3 in all
the protostellar sources.

sensitive to the surface density profile of the background disk. We find that
migration times in excess of runaway envelope accretion times or T-Tauri disk

between observations seperated by 20 years. In spectra published by Bouvier &
Appenzeller (1992) these objects showed very weak H-alpha emission, broad CaII
absorption and so called ``composite spectra'', where the spectral type
inferred from the blue region is earlier than that inferred from the red. We
present here new spectroscopy which shows that all four stars now exhibit
strong H-alpha emission, narrow CaII emission and a spectral type which is
consistent at all wavelengths.
  We propose a scheme to understand these changes whereby the composite spectra
of these stars can be explained by a period of active accretion onto the
central, young star. In this scheme the composite spectrum consists of a
contribution from the stellar photosphere and a contribution from a hot,
optically thick, accretion component. The optically thick nature of the
accretion flow explains the weakness of the H-alpha emission during this phase.
Within this scheme, the change to a single spectral type at all wavelengths and
emergence of strong H-alpha emission are consistent with the accretion columns
becoming optically thin, as the accretion rate drops. There is a strong analogy
here with the dwarf novae class of interacting binaries, which show similar
behaviour during the decline from outbursts of high mass-transfer rate.
  The most important consequence of this interpretation is that these objects
bring into question the association of Weak-Line T Tauri stars (WTTs) with
non-accreting or discless objects. In light of this result we consider the
justification for this paradigm.

concluding that the intrinsic alignment effect is at the lower end of the range
of theoretical predictions. We also revisit this theoretical issue, and show
that misalignment of baryon and halo angular momenta may be an important effect
which can reduce the intrinsic ellipticity correlations estimated from
numerical simulations to the level that we and the SuperCOSMOS survey observe.
We re-examine the cosmological parameter estimation from the COMBO-17 survey,
now marginalising over the Hubble constant. Assuming no evolution in galaxy
clustering, and marginalising over the intrinsic alignment signal, we find the
mass clustering amplitude is reduced by 0.03 to sigma_8(Omega_m / 0.27)^0.6 =
0.71 +/- 0.11. We consider the forthcoming SNAP wide weak lensing survey, and
the CFHTLS wide synoptic survey, and expect them to be contaminated on scales

finite-disk correction effects, a dynamically more consistent form for the

$\alpha$, we infer more modest speed enhancements that are in good quantitative

latitudinal variation of the surface mass flux scales with the square of the
cosine of the local tilt angle between the magnetic field and the radial

rotating hot-stars with a dipole magnetic field aligned to the star's rotation
axis. For moderate to strong fields, much wind outflow is initially along
closed magnetic loops that nearly corotate as a solid body with the underlying
star, thus providing a torque that results in an effective angular momentum
spin-up of the outflowing material. But instead of forming the ``magnetically
torqued disk'' (MTD) postulated in previous phenemenological analyses, the
dynamical simulations here show that material trapped near the tops of such
closed loops tends either to fall back or break out, depending on whether it is
below or above the Keplerian corotation radius. Overall the results raise
serious questions about whether magnetic torquing of a wind outflow could
naturally result in a Keplerian circumstellar disk. However, for very strong
fields, it does still seem possible to form a %``magnetically confined,
centrifugally supported, rigid-body disk'', centrifugally supported,
``magnetically rigid disk'' (MRD), in which the field not only forces material
to maintain a rigid-body rotation, but for some extended period also holds it
down against the outward centrifugal force at the loop tops. We argue that such
rigid-body disks seem ill-suited to explain the disk emission from Be stars,
but could provide a quite attractive paradigm for circumstellar emission from
the magnetically strong Bp and Ap stars.

dipole magnetic field in inducing large-scale structure in the line-driven
stellar winds of hot, luminous stars. Unlike previous fixed-field analyses, the
MHD simulations here take full account of the dynamical competition between the
field and the flow. A key result is that the overall degree to which the wind
is influenced by the field depends largely on a single, dimensionless `wind
magnetic confinement parameter', $\eta_\ast (= B_{eq}^2 R_{\ast}^2/\dot{M}
v_\infty$), which characterizes the ratio between magnetic field energy density
and kinetic energy density of the wind. For weak confinement, $\eta_\ast \le
1$, the field is fully opened by wind outflow, but nonetheless, for confinement
as small as $\eta_\ast=1/10$ it can have significant back-influence in
enhancing the density and reducing the flow speed near the magnetic equator.
For stronger confinement, $\eta_\ast > 1$, the magnetic field remains closed
over limited range of latitude and height above the equatorial surface, but
eventually is opened into nearly radial configuration at large radii. Within
the closed loops, the flow is channeled toward loop tops into shock collisions
that are strong enough to produce hard X-rays. Within the open field region,
the equatorial channeling leads to oblique shocks that are again strong enough
to produce X-rays and also lead to a thin, dense, slowly outflowing ``disk'' at
the magnetic equator.

thin macrospin. We analyze its response when subjected to an external field
along its in-plane hard axis. We derive the exact trajectories of the
magnetization. The switching versus non switching behavior is delimited by a
bifurcation trajectory, for applied fields equal to half of the effective
anisotropy field. A magnetization going through this bifurcation trajectory
passes exactly along the hard axis and exhibits a vanishing characteristic
frequency at that unstable point, which makes the trajectory noise sensitive.
Attempting to approach the related minimal cost in applied field makes the
magnetization final state unpredictable. We add finite damping in the model as
a perturbative, energy dissipation factor. For a large applied field, the
system switches several times back and forth. Several trajectories can be gone
through before the system has dissipated enough energy to converge to one
attracting equilibrium state. For some moderate fields, the system switches
only once by a relaxation dominated precessional switching. We show that the
associated switching field increases linearly with the damping parameter. The
slope scales with the square root of the effective anisotropy. Our simple
concluding expressions are useful to assess the potential application of
precessional switching in magnetic random access memories.

does not completely rule out orbital current formation, because our detection
limit for a ring of scattering is 0.06(1) {\ub}, which is greater than the size
of the predicted moment of ~0.02 {\ub}. However, on heating, a ring of
quasielastic scattering does exist in the (H, K, 0) plane centered at the (1,

We believe that these incommensurate spin fluctuations compete with the AF spin
fluctuations, and drive the transition to a disordered magnetic state above

suggests that these fluctuations also play a crucial role in the formation of

present results and observations from a controlled, laboratory study of
refinding information found on the web.
  Our study was conducted as a collaborative exercise with pairs of
participants. One participant acted as a retriever, helping the other
participant re-find information by telephone. This design allowed us to gain
insight into the strategies that users employed to re-find information, and
into how domain artifacts and contextual information were used to aid the
re-finding process. We also introduced the ability for users to add their own
explicitly artifacts in the form of making annotations on the web pages they
viewed.
  We observe that re-finding often occurs as a two stage, iterative process in
which users first attempt to locate an information source (search), and once
found, begin a process to find the specific information being sought (browse).
Our findings are consistent with research on waypoints; orienteering approaches
to re-finding; and navigation of electronic spaces. Furthermore, we observed
that annotations were utilized extensively, indicating that explicitly added
context by the user can play an important role in re-finding.

of spinning compact objects is complicated by the large number of parameters
(such as the magnitudes and initial directions of the spins, and the position
and orientation of the binary with respect to the detector) that are required
to model accurately the precession-induced modulations of the GW signal. In
this paper we describe a fast matched-filtering search scheme for precessing
binaries, and we adopt the physical template family proposed by Buonanno, Chen,
and Vallisneri [Phys.Rev.D 67, 104025 (2003)] for ground-based interferometers.
This family provides essentially exact waveforms, written directly in terms of
the physical parameters, for binaries with a single significant spin, and for
which the observed GW signal is emitted during the phase of adiabatic inspiral
(for LIGO-I and VIRGO, this corresponds to a total mass M < 15Msun). We show
how the detection statistic can be maximized automatically over all the
parameters (including the position and orientation of the binary with respect
to the detector), except four (the two masses, the magnitude of the single
spin, and the opening angle between the spin and the orbital angular momentum),
so the template bank used in the search is only four-dimensional; this
technique is relevant also to the searches for GW from extreme--mass-ratio
inspirals and supermassive blackhole inspirals to be performed using the
space-borne detector LISA. Using the LIGO-I design sensitivity, we compute the
detection threshold (~10) required for a false-alarm probability of

omega meson couples to baryon density, it leads to a pseudo-gap scenario for
the chiral symmetry phase transition, which is at variance with standard
scenario of QCD at the phase transition. We find that in the presence of the
omega mesons, the scale-anomaly dilaton field is prevented from developing a
vanishing vacuum expectation value at the chiral restoration, as a consequence
of which the in-medium pion decay constant does not vanish. This seems to
indicate that the omega degree of freedom obstructs the vector manifestation

theory with exact Lorentz symmetry and microcausality. For example, the bosonic
sfermions have spin 1/2 and the fermionic gauginos have spin 1. The theory is
based on a phenomenological action that is shown to follow from a simple
microscopic and statistical picture.

"math/0310084","Andras Nemethi","Andras Nemethi","Line bundles associated with normal surface singularities","12 pages",,,,"math.AG math.GT",,"  Recently L. Nicolaescu and the author formulated a conjecture which relates
the geometric genus of a complex analytic normal surface singularity (whose
link $M$ is a rational homology sphere) with the Seiberg-Witten invariant of
$M$ associated with the ``canonical'' $spin^c$ structure of $M$. Since the
Seiberg-Witten theory of the link $M$ provides a rational number for any
$spin^c$ structure it was a natural challenge to search for a complete set of
conjecturally valid identities, which involve all the Seiberg-Witten invariants
(giving an analytic -- i.e. singularity theoretical -- interpretation of them).
  The formulation of this set of identities is one of the goals of the present
article. In fact, we formulate conjecturally valid inequalities which became
equalities in special rigid situations.
  In this way, the Seiberg-Witten invariants determine optimal topological
upper bounds for the dimensions of the first sheaf-cohomology of line bundles
living on the resolution. Moreover, for $\Q$-Gorenstein singularities and some
``natural'' line bundles equality holds.
  The first part of the article constructs these ``natural'' holomorphic line
bundles. The line-bundle construction is compatible with abelian covers. This
allows us to reformulate the conjecture in its second version which relates the
echivariant geometric genus (associated with the universal abelian cover of the
singular germ) with the Seiberg-Witten invariants of the link $M$. In the last
section we verify the conjecture for rational singularities.

  Prediction, February 1988, Baltimore, MD., USA","physics.gen-ph",,"  Atmospheric weather systems are coherent structures consisting of discrete
cloud cells forming patterns of rows/streets, mesoscale clusters and spiral
bands which maintain their identity for the duration of their appreciable life
times in the turbulent shear flow of the planetary Atmospheric Boundary Layer.
The existence of coherent structures (seemingly systematic motion) in turbulent
flows has been well established during the last 20 years of research in
turbulence. Numerical weather prediction models based on the inherently
non-linear Navier-Stokes equations do not give realistic forecasts because of
the following inherent limitations: (1) the non-linear governing equations for
atmospheric flows do not have exact analytic solutions and being sensitive to
initial conditions give chaotic solutions characteristic of deterministic chaos
(2) the governing equations do not incorporate the dynamical interactions and
co-existence of the complete spectrum of turbulent fluctuations which form an
integral part of the large coherent weather systems (3) limitations of
available computer capacity necessitates severe truncation of the governing
equations, thereby generating errors of approximations (4) the computer
precision related roundoff errors magnify the earlier mentioned uncertainties
exponentially with time and the model predictions become unrealistic. The
accurate modelling of weather phenomena therefore requires alternative concepts
and computational techniques. In this paper a universal theory of deterministic
chaos applicable to the formation of coherent weather structures in the ABL is
presented.

observable with Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) or Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC)
algorithms is presented. The basic idea consists in replacing the usual
``bare'' estimator associated with the observable by an improved or
``renormalized'' estimator. Using this estimator more accurate averages are
obtained: Not only the statistical fluctuations are reduced but also the
systematic error (bias) associated with the approximate VMC or (fixed-node) DMC
probability densities. It is shown that improved estimators obey a
Zero-Variance Zero-Bias (ZVZB) property similar to the usual Zero-Variance
Zero-Bias property of the energy with the local energy as improved estimator.
Using this property improved estimators can be optimized and the resulting
accuracy on expectation values may reach the remarkable accuracy obtained for
total energies. As an important example, we present the application of our
formalism to the computation of forces in molecular systems. Calculations of
the entire force curve of the H$_2$,LiH, and Li$_2$ molecules are presented.
Spectroscopic constants $R_e$ (equilibrium distance) and $\omega_e$ (harmonic
frequency) are also computed. The equilibrium distances are obtained with a
relative error smaller than 1%, while the harmonic frequencies are computed
with an error of about 10%.

test the bounds of quantum correlation. As expected from the theory we found
that, for certain choices of local observables, Cirel'son's bound of the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality ($2\sqrt{2}$) is not reached by any
quantum states.

anisotropic molecules whose orientation by an external electric field is
state-dependent. It is based on decoupling of the lower-state molecules from
the resonant light while the excited ones remain emitting. The suitable class
of molecules is discussed, the equation for the gain factor is derived, and the
magnitude of the inversionless amplification is estimated for the typical
experimental conditions. Such switching of the sample from absorbing to
amplifying via transparent state is shown to be possible both with the aid of
dc and ac control electric fields.

Opt. 6 (2004) S492","10.1088/1464-4266/6/6/006",,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate some examples of quantum Zeno dynamics, when a system
undergoes very frequent (projective) measurements that ascertain whether it is
within a given spatial region. In agreement with previously obtained results,
the evolution is found to be unitary and the generator of the Zeno dynamics is
the Hamiltonian with hard-wall (Dirichlet) boundary conditions. By using a new
approach to this problem, this result is found to be valid in an arbitrary
$N$-dimensional compact domain. We then propose some preliminary ideas
concerning the algebra of observables in the projected region and finally look
at the case of a projection onto a lower dimensional space: in such a situation
the Zeno ansatz turns out to be a procedure to impose constraints.

measurement. We show the visibility and the strength of the interference fringe
related to the SPDC interaction. It may provide a strong quantum lithography
with a moderate visibility in practical application.

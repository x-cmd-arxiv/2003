divergence-free relation and the related properties of the magnetic field B as
built-in conditions. Our approach mostly relies on the 'Constrained Transport'
(CT) discretization technique for the magnetic field components, originally
developed for the linear induction equation, which assures div(B)=0 and its
preservation in time to within machine accuracy in a finite-volume setting. We
show that the CT formalism, when fully exploited, can be used as a general
guideline to design the reconstruction procedures of the B vector field, to
adapt standard upwind procedures for the momentum and energy equations,
avoiding the onset of numerical monopoles of O(1) size, and to formulate
approximate Riemann solvers for the induction equation. This general framework
will be named here 'Upwind Constrained Transport' (UCT). To demonstrate the
versatility of our method, we apply it to a variety of schemes, which are
finally validated numerically and compared: a novel implementation for the MHD
case of the second order Roe-type positive scheme by Liu and Lax (J. Comp.

distribution of dust in a spiral galaxy and considers the effect of changing
some of the parameters characterizing the dust grains, size in particular. We
first simulated 500 GRBs distributed as the host galaxy mass distribution,
using as model the Milky Way. If we consider dust with the same properties as
that we observe in the Milky Way, we find that due to absorption we miss about
10% of the afterglows assuming we observe the event within about 1 hour or even
within 100s. In our second set of simulations we placed GRBs randomly inside
giants molecular clouds, considering different kinds of dust inside and outside
the host cloud and the effect of dust sublimation caused by the GRB inside the
clouds. In this case absorption is mainly due to the host cloud and the
physical properties of dust play a strong role. Computations from this model
agree with the hypothesis of host galaxies with extinction curve similar to
that of the Small Magellanic Cloud, whereas the host cloud could be also
characterized by dust with larger grains. To confirm our findings we need a set
of homogeneous infrared observations. The use of coming dedicated infrared
telescopes, like REM, will provide a wealth of cases of new afterglow

harbor massive concentrations of gas in their centers, and some are known to
possess supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their associated stellar cusps.
Previous theoretical work has suggested that a bar in a galaxy could be
dissolved by the formation of a mass concentration in the center, although the
precise mass and degree of central concentration required is not
well-established. We report an extensive study of the effects of central masses
on bars in high-quality N-body simulations of galaxies. We have varied the
growth rate of the central mass, its final mass and degree of concentration to
examine how these factors affect the evolution of the bar. Our main conclusions
are: (1) Bars are more robust than previously thought. The central mass has to
be as large as several percent of the disk mass to completely destroy the bar
on a short timescale. (2) For a given mass, dense objects cause the greatest
reduction in bar amplitude, while significantly more diffuse objects have a
lesser effect. (3) The bar amplitude always decreases as the central mass is
grown, and continues to decay thereafter on a cosmological time-scale. (4) The
first phase of bar-weakening is due to the destruction by the CMC of
lower-energy, bar-supporting orbits, while the second phase is a consequence of
secular changes to the global potential which further diminish the number of
bar-supporting orbits. We provide detailed phase-space and orbit analysis to
support this suggestion. Thus current masses of SMBHs are probably too small,
even when dressed with a stellar cusp, to affect the bar in their host
galaxies. The molecular gas concentrations found in some barred galaxies are
also too diffuse to affect the amplitude of the bar significantly.

rely on feedback in order to maintain gas with short cooling times, while
preventing the bulk of the gas from cooling to low temperatures. The primary
candidate for the feedback mechanism is the accretion of cooled and cooling gas
by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Despite some difficulties with this model,
the high incidence of central radio sources in cooling flows and the common
occurrence of radio lobe cavities, together, support this view. The Bondi
accretion rate for the intracluster gas onto the AGN depends on the gas
properties only through its specific entropy and that is governed directly by
competition between heating and cooling. This provides a viable link for the
feedback process. It is argued that the mass accreted between outbursts by the
central AGN is only sensitive to the mass of the black hole and the gas
temperature. Bondi accretion by an AGN leads to a simple expression for
outburst energy that can be tested against observations.

volume are generally constant on superhorizon scales. In real space an
analytical analysis can be extended beyond fluids to neutrinos.
  The faster cosmological expansion due to the neutrino background changes the
acoustic and damping angular scales of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
But we find that equivalent changes can be produced by varying other standard
parameters, including the primordial helium abundance. The low-l integrated
Sachs-Wolfe effect is also not sensitive to neutrinos. However, the gravity of
neutrino perturbations suppresses the CMB acoustic peaks for the multipoles
with l>~200 while it enhances the amplitude of matter fluctuations on these
scales. In addition, the perturbations of relativistic neutrinos generate a
*unique phase shift* of the CMB acoustic oscillations that for adiabatic
initial conditions cannot be caused by any other standard physics. The origin
of the shift is traced to neutrino free-streaming velocity exceeding the sound
speed of the photon-baryon plasma. We find that from a high resolution, low

to its closer orbit may produce a stronger tidal effect than the LMC. Evidence
that Sgr may be responsible for the warp comes from its orbital angular
momentum, which has the same magnitude as the angular momentum of the warped
component of the Galactic disk and is anti-aligned with it. We have run high
resolution numerical N-body simulations of Sgr-sized satellites around a Milky
Way-sized disk to test this idea. Preliminary results suggest that Sgr-sized
satellites can indeed excite warps with properties similar to that observed for
the Milky Way.

Gyr and another recent and metal-rich population. To examine the validity of
the models we compare XLFs calculated for varying ages of the populations and
varying relative weights for the star-formation rates in the two populations.
  We find that, for typical binary evolution parameters, it is indeed possible
to quite closely match the observed XLF shape.

systems are the origin of these low-alpha stars. Stars engulfing a small
fraction of planetesimals enhance the surface content of Fe to exhibit low
alpha/Fe ratios on their surfaces while they are on the main-sequence, because
dwarfs have shallow surface convection zones where the engulfed matter is
mixed. After the stars leave the main-sequence, the surface convection zones
become deeper to reduce the enhancement of Fe. Eventually, when the stars
ascend to the tip of the red giant branch, they engulf giant planets to become
low-alpha stars again as observed in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We predict that
low-alpha stars with low Mn/Fe ratios harbor planetary systems.

distributions of mass, orbital period, and eccentricity of the extrasolar
planets. In addition, tidal interactions between giant planets in the solar
system and their moons are thought to be responsible for the orbital migration
of the satellites, leading to their capture into resonant configurations. We
treat the underlying fluid dynamical problem with the aim of determining the
efficiency of tidal dissipation in gaseous giant planets. In cases of interest,
the tidal forcing frequencies are comparable to the spin frequency of the
planet but small compared to its dynamical frequency. We therefore study the
linearized response of a slowly and possibly differentially rotating planet to
low-frequency tidal forcing. Convective regions of the planet support inertial
waves, while any radiative regions support generalized Hough waves. We present
illustrative numerical calculations of the tidal dissipation rate and argue
that inertial waves provide a natural avenue for efficient tidal dissipation in
most cases of interest. The resulting value of Q depends in a highly erratic
way on the forcing frequency, but we provide evidence that the relevant
frequency-averaged dissipation rate may be asymptotically independent of the
viscosity in the limit of small Ekman number. In short-period extrasolar
planets, if the stellar irradiation of the planet leads to the formation of a
radiative outer layer that supports generalized Hough modes, the tidal
dissipation rate can be enhanced through the excitation and damping of these
waves. These dissipative mechanisms offer a promising explanation of the
historical evolution and current state of the Galilean satellites as well as
the observed circularization of the orbits of short-period extrasolar planets.

relaxation, while endogenous sale peaks occur after a progressively
accelerating power law growth followed by an approximately symmetrical power
law relaxation which is slower than for exogenous peaks. These results are
rationalized quantitatively by a simple model of epidemic propagation of
interactions with long memory within a network of acquaintances. The slow
relaxation of sales implies that the sales dynamics is dominated by cascades
rather than by the direct effects of news or advertisements, indicating that
the social network is close to critical.

spatio-temporal order in nonequilibrium scalar field theories. The onset of
order is triggered by destabilizing interactions (DIs), which instantaneously
change the interacting potential from a single to a double-well, tunable to be
either degenerate (SDW) or nondegenerate (ADW). For the SDW case, we observe
the emergence of spatio-temporal coherent structures known as oscillons. We
show that this emergence is initially synchronized, the result of parametric
amplification of the relevant oscillon modes. We also discuss how these ordered
structures act as bottlenecks for equipartition. For ADW potentials, we show
how the same parametric amplification mechanism may trigger the rapid decay of
a metastable state. For a range of temperatures, the decay rates associated
with this resonant nucleation can be orders of magnitude larger than those
computed by homogeneous nucleation, with time-scales given by a simple power
law, $\tau_{\rm RN}\sim[E_b/k_BT]^B$, where $B$ depends weakly on the
temperature and $E_b/k_BT$ is the free-energy barrier of a critical

material in the form of two separate stacks of densely packed filaments
embedded in a metallic matrix of Ag or Ag alloy. This kind of sample geometry
is quite favorable for studying the coupling currents and in particular the
role of superconducting bridges between filaments. By using a.c. susceptibility
technique, the electromagnetic losses as function of a.c. magnetic field
amplitude and frequency were measured at the temperature T = 77 K for two tapes
with different matrix composition. The length of samples was varied by
subsequent cutting in order to investigate its influence on the dynamics of
magnetic flux penetration. The geometrical factor $\chi_0$ which takes into
account the demagnetizing effects was established from a.c. susceptibility data
at low amplitudes. Losses vs frequency dependencies have been found to agree
nicely with the theoretical model developed for round multifilamentary wires.
Applying this model, the effective resistivity of the matrix was determined for
each tape, by using only measured quantities. For the tape with pure silver
matrix its value was found to be larger than what predicted by the theory for
given metal resistivity and filamentary architecture. On the contrary, in the
sample with a Ag/Mg alloy matrix, an effective resistivity much lower than
expected was determined. We explain these discrepancies by taking into account
the properties of the electrical contact of the interface between the
superconducting filaments and the normal matrix. In the case of soft matrix of
pure Ag, this is of poor quality, while the properties of alloy matrix seem to
provoke an extensive creation of intergrowths which can be actually observed in
this kind of samples.

was performed in earth orbit to reduce the rounding of the transition caused by
gravitationally induced pressure gradients on earth. Specific heat measurements
were made deep in the asymptotic region to within 2 nK of the transition. No
evidence of rounding was found to this resolution. The optimum value of the
critical exponent describing the specific heat singularity was found to be a =
-0.0127+ - 0.0003. This is bracketed by two recent estimates based on
renormalization group techniques, but is slightly outside the range of the
error of the most recent result. The ratio of the coefficients of the leading

constant angular momentum discs orbiting Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes.
The motivation behind this study is to investigate whether the presence of a
radial force contrasting the black hole's gravitational attraction can
influence the occurrence of the runaway instability, a robust feature of the
dynamics of constant angular momentum tori in Schwarzschild and Kerr
spacetimes. In addition to the inner cusp near the black hole horizon through
which matter can accrete onto the black hole, in fact, a positive cosmological
constant introduces also an outer cusp through which matter can leave the torus
without accreting onto the black hole. To assess the impact of this outflow on
the development of the instability we have performed time-dependent and
axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations of equilibrium initial configurations
in a sequence of background spacetimes of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes
with increasing masses. The simulations have been performed with an unrealistic
value for the cosmological constant which, however, yields sufficiently small
discs to be resolved accurately on numerical grids and thus provides a first
qualitative picture of the dynamics. The calculations, carried out for a wide
range of initial conditions, show that the mass-loss from the outer cusp can
have a considerable impact on the instability, with the latter being rapidly
suppressed if the outflow is large enough.

account; (d) the CP asymmetry $\acp(B \to \rho \gamma)$ in model III-B has an
opposite sign with the one in the standard model (SM), which may be used as a
good observable to distinguish the SM from model III-B; (e) the isospin
symmetry breaking $\Delta(\rho\gamma)$ is less than 10% in the region of
$\gamma = [ 40 \sim 70]^\circ$ preferred by the global fit result, but can be
as large as 20 to 40% in the regions of $\gamma \leq 10^\circ$ and $\gamma \geq

opposite in sign for small or large values of the CKM angles; (f) the U-spin

The generation rate of primary defects is calculated starting from the
projectile - silicon interaction and from the recoil energy redistribution in
the lattice. The mechanisms of formation of complex defects are explicitly
analysed. Vacancy-interstitial annihilation, interstitial and vacancy migration
to sinks, divacancy, vacancy- and interstitial-impurity complex formation and
decomposition are considered. Oxygen and carbon impurities present in silicon
could monitor the concentration of all stable defects, due to their interaction
with vacancies and interstitials. Their role in the mechanisms of formation and
decomposition of the following stable defects: V_2, VO, V_2O, C_i, C_iO_i,
C_iC_s and VP, is studied. The model predictions cover a generation primary
rate of defects between 10^2 pairs/cm3/s and 10^{11} pairs/cm3/s, and could be
a useful clue in obtaining harder materials for detectors for space missions,

restricting the complexified initial dynamical system to the fixed point set of

symplectomorphic) to the initial phase space. Thus to each real Hamiltonian
system we are able to associate another nonequivalent (real) ones. A crucial
role in this construction is played by the assumed analyticity and the
invariance of the Hamiltonian under the involution. We show that if the initial
system is Liouville integrable, then its complexification and its real forms
will be integrable again and this provides a method of finding new integrable
systems starting from known ones. We demonstrate our construction by finding
real forms of dynamics for the Toda chain and a family of Calogero--Moser

Phys. 7, 120 (2005)","10.1088/1367-2630/7/1/120",,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  Single spin measurement represents a major challenge for spin-based quantum
computation. In this article we propose a new method for measuring the spin of
a single electron confined in a quantum dot (QD). Our strategy is based on
entangling (using unitary gates) the spin and orbital degrees of freedom. An
{\em orbital qubit}, defined by a second, empty QD, is used as an ancilla and
is prepared in a known initial state. Measuring the orbital qubit will reveal
the state of the (unknown) initial spin qubit, hence reducing the problem to
the easier task of single charge measurement. Since spin-charge conversion is
done with unit probability, single-shot measurement of an electronic spin can
be, in principle, achieved. We evaluate the robustness of our method against
various sources of error and discuss briefly possible implementations.

relationship with the response function of a system, and have a much wider
range of applicability in both the classical and quantum domains than
previously thought. Using this idea, we have built an optical system, based on
a birefringent photonic crystal, with an infinite number of weak values. In
this system, the propagation speed of a polarized light pulse displays both
superluminal and slow light behavior with a sharp transition between the two
regimes. We show that this system's response possesses two-dimensional,
vortex-antivortex phase singularities. Important consequences for optical
signal processing are discussed.

(nonresonant transitions) are calculated analytically for a scalable
solid-state quantum computer based on a one-dimensional spin chain with Ising
interactions between neighboring spins. Selective excitations of the spins are
enabled by a uniform gradient of the external magnetic field. We calculate the
probabilities of all unwanted nonresonant transitions associated with the flip
of each spin with nonresonant frequency and with flips of two spins: one with
resonant and one with nonresonant frequencies. It is shown that these errors
oscillate with changing the gradient of the external magnetic field. Choosing
the optimal values of this gradient allows us to decrease these errors by 50%.

one-dimensional scaling quantum graphs. Strongly stochastic in the classical
limit, these systems are frequently employed as models of quantum chaos. We
show that despite their classical stochasticity all scaling quantum graphs are
explicitly solvable in the form $E_n=f(n)$, where $n$ is the sequence number of
the energy level of the quantum graph and $f$ is a known function, which
depends only on the physical and geometrical properties of the quantum graph.
Our method of solution motivates a new classification scheme for quantum
graphs: we show that each quantum graph can be uniquely assigned an integer $m$
reflecting its level of complexity. We show that a taut string with piecewise
constant mass density provides an experimentally realizable analogue system of
scaling quantum graphs.

identified as the component state having better-than-even probability to be
found by measurement at the end time--even though probability for the final
ground state in a quantum adiabatic process need not monotonically increase
towards one in general. Presented finally are the reasons why our algorithm is
outside the jurisdiction of no-go arguments previously employed to show that
Hilbert's tenth problem is recursively non-computable.

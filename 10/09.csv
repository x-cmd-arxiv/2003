  D.J. Pisano, Mark walker & Ken Freeman, Publ. Astron. Soc. Pac",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The competition between CDM and MOND to account for the `missing mass'
phenomena is asymmetric. MOND has clearly demonstrated that a characteristic
acceleration $a_0$ underlies the data and understanding what gives rise to
$a_0$ is an important task. The reason for MOND's success may lie in either the
details of galaxy formation, or an advance in fundamental physics that reduces
to MOND in a suitable limit. CDM has enjoyed great success on large scales. The
theory cannot be definitively tested on small scales until galaxy formation has
been understood because baryons either are, or possibly have been, dominant in
all small-scale objects. MOND's predictive power is seriously undermined by its
isolation from the rest of physics. In view of this isolation, the way forward
is probably to treat CDM as an established theory to be used alongside
relativity and electromagnetism in efforts to understand the formation and
evolution of galaxies.

less than 30%. When combined with previous work on other QSO pairs, we find
that the fractional variation increases steadily with separation out to at

show strong variations (often > 80%) over kpc scales. A minimum radius for
strong (EW > 0.3 A) MgII systems of > 1.4 kpc is inferred from absorption
coincidences in all lines of sight. For weak MgII absorbers (EW < 0.3 A), a
maximum likelihood analysis indicates a most probable coherence scale of 2.0
kpc for a uniform spherical geometry, with 95% confidence limits ranging
between 1.5 and 4.4 kpc. Finally, for systems with weak absorption that can be

winds may contain a relativistic component that generates powerful synchrotron
radiation, but it is not clear that all winds do so. The spatial and temporal
stability of the AGN/cooling flow interaction are discussed. Collimation of the
winds probably provides spatial stability. Temporal stability may be possible
only for black holes with masses above a critical value. Both the failure of
cooling flows to have adiabatic cores and the existence of X-ray cavities
confirm the importance of collimated outflows. I quantify the scale of the
convective flow that the AGN Hydra would need to drive if it balanced radiative
inward flow by outward flow parallel to the jets. At least in Virgo any such
flow must be confined to r<~20 kpc. Hydrodynamical simulations suggest that AGN
outbursts cannot last longer than ~25 Myr. Data for four clusters with well
studied X-ray cavities suggests that heating associated with cavity formation
approximately balances radiative cooling. The role of cosmic infall and the
mechanism of filament formation are briefly touched on.

  Astrophysical Journal","Astrophys.J.604:484-494,2004","10.1086/381935",,"astro-ph",,"  Motivated by the recent detection by WMAP of a large optical depth to Thomson
scattering -- implying a very early reionization epoch -- we assess a scenario
where the universe was reionized by `miniquasars' powered by intermediate-mass
black holes (IMBHs), the remnants of the first generation of massive stars.
Pregalactic IMBHs form within minihalos above the cosmological Jeans mass
collapsing at z=24, get incorporated through mergers into larger and larger
systems, sink to the center owing to dynamical friction, and accrete cold
material. The merger history of dark halos and associated IMBHs is followed by
Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy in a LCDM cosmology. While
seed IMBHs that are as rare as the 3.5-sigma peaks of the primordial density
field evolve largely in isolation, a significant number of black hole binary
systems will form if IMBHs populate the more numerous 3-sigma peaks instead. In
the case of rapid binary coalescence a fraction of IMBHs will be displaced from
galaxy centers and ejected into the IGM by the `gravitational rocket' effect,
rather than accrete and shine as miniquasars. We show that, under a number of
plausible assumptions for the amount of gas accreted onto IMBHs and their
emission spectrum, miniquasars powered by IMBHs may be responsible for
cosmological reionization at z~15. Reionization by miniquasars with a hard
spectrum may be more `economical' than stellar reionization, as soft X-rays
escape more easily from the dense sites of star formation and travel further
than EUV radiation. Energetic photons will make the diffuse IGM warm and weakly
ionized prior to the epoch of reionization breakthrough, set an entropy floor,
and reduce gas clumping. Future 21 cm observations may detect a preheated,
weakly-ionized IGM in emission against the CMB. (abridged)

millisecond X-ray pulsars presents some difficulties for the conventional
picture of accretion onto rapidly rotating magnetized neutron stars and their
spin behavior during outbursts. In particular, it is unclear from the standard
paradigm how these systems manage to accrete over such a wide range in dM/dt
(i.e., >~ a factor of 50), and why the neutron stars exhibit a high rate of
spindown in at least a number of cases. Following up on prior suggestions, we
propose that `fast' X-ray pulsars can continue to accrete, and that their
accretion disks terminate at approximately the corotation radius. We
demonstrate the existence of such disk solutions by modifying the
Shakura-Sunyaev equations with a simple magnetic torque prescription. The
solutions are completely analytic, and have the same dependence on dM/dt and
alpha (the viscosity parameter) as the original Shakura-Sunyaev solutions; but,
the radial profiles can be considerably modified, depending on the degree of
fastness. We apply these results to compute the torques expected during the
outbursts of the transient millisecond pulsars, and find that we can explain
the large spindown rates that are observed for quite plausible surface magnetic
fields of ~10^9 G.

investigate this possibility, we obtained the first deep imaging in the far

model-independent, upper limits of typically 2 x 10**-19 erg/sec/cm2/Ang were
obtained for the ionizing flux escaping from these normal galaxies. This
corresponds to lower limits on the observed ratio of 1500 to 700Ang flux of 150

that less than 6%, down to less than 1%, of the available ionizing flux emitted

at the Lyman l imit confirms that the basic premise of `Lyman break' searches
for galaxies at high redshift can also be applied at intermediate redshifts.

feedback from supernovae and an initial infall episode. By comparing model
predictions with observations, we derive a picture of galaxy formation in which
the higher is the mass of the galaxy, the shorter are the infall and the star
formation timescales. Therefore, in this scenario, the most massive objects are
older than the less massive ones, in the sense that larger galaxies stop
forming stars at earlier times. Each galaxy is created outside-in, i.e. the
outermost regions accrete gas, form stars and develop a galactic wind very
quickly, compared to the central core in which the star formation can last up
to ~1.3 Gyr. In particular, we suggest that both the duration of the star
formation and the infall timescale decrease with galactic radius. (abridged) By
means of our model, we are able to match the observed mass-metallicity and
color-magnitude relations for the center of the galaxies as well as to
reproduce the overabundance of Mg relative to Fe, observed in the nuclei of
bright ellipticals, and its increase with galactic mass. Furthermore, we find
that the observed Ca underabundance relative to Mg can be real, due to the
non-neglibile contribution of type Ia SN to the production of this element. We
predict metallicity and color gradients inside the galaxies which are in good
agreement with the mean value of the observed ones. (abridged)

use order statistics, which is known as Kuiper's statistic. The particular
advantage of the method we present is that, when coupled to the judicious use
of Monte Carlo simulations, it can deliver very interesting results from small

spherical harmonics at low l for which there are only small number of
independent values of m and which therefore furnish only a small number of
phases for analysis. We apply the method to the COBE-DMR and WMAP sky maps, and
find departures from uniformity in both. In the case of WMAP, our results

Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) confirm this model to spectacular precision on all but
the largest scales (Bennett {\it et al.}, 2003 ; Spergel {\it et al.}, 2003).
Temperature correlations across the microwave sky match expectations on scales
narrower than $60^{\circ}$, yet vanish on scales wider than $60^{\circ}$.
Researchers are now seeking an explanation of the missing wide-angle
correlations (Contaldi {\it et al.}, 2003 ; Cline {\it et al.}, 2003). One
natural approach questions the underlying geometry of space, namely its
curvature (Efstathiou, 2003) and its topology (Tegmark {\it et al.}, 2003). In
an infinite flat space, waves from the big bang would fill the universe on all
length scales. The observed lack of temperature correlations on scales beyond
$60^{\circ}$ means the broadest waves are missing, perhaps because space itself
is not big enough to support them.
  Here we present a simple geometrical model of a finite, positively curved
space -- the Poincar\'e dodecahedral space -- which accounts for WMAP's
observations with no fine-tuning required. Circle searching (Cornish, Spergel
and Starkman, 1998) may confirm the model's topological predictions, while
upcoming Planck Surveyor data may confirm its predicted density of $\Omega_0
\simeq 1.013 > 1$. If confirmed, the model will answer the ancient question of
whether space is finite or infinite, while retaining the standard

observed azimuthal distribution of polarization angles, we find that the
regular magnetic field, averaged over scales 1--3 kpc, is almost perfectly
axisymmetric in the radial range 8 to 14 kpc, and follows a spiral pattern with
pitch angles of $p\simeq -19\degr$ to $p\simeq -8\degr$. In the ring between 6
and 8 kpc a perturbation of the dominant axisymmetric mode may be present,
having the azimuthal wave number m=2. A systematic analysis of the observed
depolarization allows us to identify the main mechanism for wavelength
dependent depolarization -- Faraday rotation measure gradients arising in a
magneto-ionic screen above the synchrotron disk. Modelling of the
depolarization leads to constraints on the relative scale heights of the
thermal and synchrotron emitting layers in M31; the thermal layer is found to
be up to three times thicker than the synchrotron disk. The regular magnetic
field must be coherent over a vertical scale at least similar to the scale
height of the thermal layer, estimated to be $h\therm\simeq 1$ kpc. Faraday
effects offer a powerful method to detect thick magneto-ionic disks or halos
around spiral galaxies.

hyperon cores and with accreted envelopes. It is assumed that an envelope has
an outer helium layer (of variable depth) and deeper layers of heavier
elements, either with iron or with much heavier nuclei (of atomic weight A >
100) on the top (Haensel & Zdunik 1990, 2003, astro-ph/0305220). The relation
between the internal and surface stellar temperatures is obtained and fitted.
The quiescent luminosity of the hottest (low-mass) and coldest (high-mass)
neutron stars is calculated, together with the ranges of its possible
variations due to variable thickness of the helium layer. The results are
compared with observations of SXTs, particularly, containing the coldest (SAX
J1808.4-3658) and the hottest (Aql X-1) neutron stars. The observations of SAX
J1808.4-3658 in a quiescent state on March 24, 2001 (Campana et al. 2002,

electrons is preferable. Future observations may discriminate between the
various models of hyperon/nucleon dense matter. The thermal emission of SAX
J1808.4-3658 is also sensitive to the models of plasma ionization in the
outermost surface layers and can serve for testing such models.

originating in the circumstellar material of IRS2 is dominated by emission from

flux density distribution is best described by a stellar wind recombining at a

cosmological perturbations in a universe containing photons, baryons,
neutrinos, cold dark matter, and a scalar quintessence field. By formulating
the evolution in terms of a differential equation involving a matrix acting on
a vector comprised of the perturbation variables, we can use the familiar
language of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. As the largest eigenvalue of the
evolution matrix is fourfold degenerate, it follows that there are four
dominant modes with non-diverging gravitational potential at early times,
corresponding to adiabatic, cold dark matter isocurvature, baryon isocurvature
and neutrino isocurvature perturbations. We conclude that quintessence does not
lead to an additional independent mode.

stable or absolutely stable configurations with an action below the
one-instanton action $S_{inst}=2\pi^2$ both in the deconfinement and the
confinement phases. In this paper we attempt an interpretation of these lowest
action configurations. Their action is purely magnetic and amounts to
$S/S_{inst} \approx N_t/N_s$, where $N_t$ ($N_s$) is the timelike (spacelike)
lattice size, while the topological charge vanishes. In the confined phase part
of the corresponding lattice configurations turns out to be absolutely stable
with respect to the cooling process in which case Abelian projection reveals a
homogeneous, purely Abelian magnetic field closed over the ""boundary"" in one of
the spatial directions. Referring to the dyonic structure established for the
confinement phase near $T_c$ and based on the observation made for this phase
that such events below the instanton action $S_{inst}$ emerge from
dyon-antidyon annihilation, the question of stability (metastability) is
discussed for both phases. The hypothetically different dyonic structure of the
deconfinement phase, inaccessible by cooling, could explain the metastability.

for the so-called quark-gluon plasma, a new state of matter which should have
existed a few microseconds after the Big Bang. A quark-gluon plasma consists of
free color charges, i.e. quarks and gluons, interacting by the strong (instead
of electromagnetic) force. Theoretical considerations predict that the critical
temperature for the phase transition from nuclear matter to a quark-gluon
plasma is about 150 - 200 MeV. In the laboratory such a temperature can be
reached in a so-called relativistic heavy-ion collision in accelerator
experiments. Using the color charge instead of the electric charge, the Coulomb
coupling parameter of such a system is of the order 10 - 30. Hence the
quark-gluon plasma is a strongly coupled, relativistic plasma, in which also
quantum effects are important. In the present work the experimental and
theoretical status of the quark-gluon plasma physics will be reviewed,
emphasizing the similarities and differences with usual plasma physics.
Furthermore, the mixed phase consisting of free quarks and gluons together with
hadrons (e.g. pions) will be discussed, which can be regarded as a complex

are massless and there are no tachyon states in the spectrum. The zero mode
conformal operator defines the levels of the physical Fock space. All levels
can be classified by the highest Casimir operator W of the little group E(11)
for massless particles in 11-dimensions. The ground state is infinitely
degenerated and contains massless gauge fields of arbitrary large integer spin,
realizing the irreducible representations of E(11) of fixed helicity. The
excitation levels realize CSR representations of little group E(11) with an
infinite number of helicities. After inspection of the first excitation level,
which, as I prove, is a physical null state, I conjecture that all excitation
levels are physical null states. In this theory the tensor field of the second
rank does not play any distinctive role and therefore one can suggest that in
this model there is no gravity.

types of generalized defects are studied. These not only mean an alteration of
the coupling constant as previously examined, but an additional arbitrary
transformation in the algebra of observables at one site of the chain. One can
distinguish between two classes of generalized defects: those which do not
affect the finite-size integrability of the Ising chain, and on the other hand
those that destroy this property. In this context, finite-size integrability is
always understood as a synonym for the possibility to write the Hamiltonian of
the finite chain as a bilinear expression in fermionic operators by means of a
Jordan-Wigner transformation. Concerning the first type of defect, an exact
solution for the scaling spectrum is obtained for the most universal defect
that preserves the global Z_2 symmetry of the chain. It is shown that in the
continuum limit this yields the same result as for one properly chosen
`ordinary' defect, that is changing the coupling constant only, and thus the
finite-size scaling spectra can be described by irreps of a shifted u(1)
Kac-Moody algebra. The other type of defect is examined by means of numerical
finite-size calculations. In contrast to the first case, these suggest a
non-continuous dependence of the scaling dimensions on the defect parameters. A
conjecture for the operator content involving only one primary field of a
Virasoro algebra with central charge c=1/2 is given.

compact group G, first studied by P. Eymard, have played an important role in

Recently, there has been interest in developing versions of these algebras for
locally compact groupoids, justification being that, just as in the group case,
the algebras should play a useful role in the study of groupoid operator
algebras. Versions of these algebras for the locally compact groupoid case
appear in three related theories: (1) a measured groupoid theory (J. Renault),
(2) a Borel theory (A. Ramsay and M. Walter), and (3) a continuous theory (A.
Paterson). The present paper is expository in character. For motivational
reasons, it starts with a description of the theory of B(G), A(G) in the
locally compact group case, before discussing these three realted theories.
Some open questions are also raised.

case of the rare species 43Ca+ and 46Ca+, which have not previously been

Phys. 54 (2004) 147","10.1023/B:CJOP.0000014380.30604.a8",,"quant-ph",,"  The eigenstates of a diagonalizable PT-symmetric Hamiltonian satisfy
unconventional completeness and orthonormality relations. These relations
reflect the properties of a pair of bi-orthonormal bases associated with
non-hermitean diagonalizable operators. In a similar vein, such a dual pair of
bases is shown to possess, in the presence of PT symmetry, a Gram matrix of a
particular structure: its inverse is obtained by simply swapping the signs of
some its matrix elements.

measurements into probability distributions containing secret correlations, and
(ii) if a probability distribution obtained from a quantum state contains
secret correlations, then this state has to be entangled. These results prove
the existence of a two-way connection between secret and quantum correlations
in the process of preparation. They also imply that either it is possible to
map any bound entangled state into a distillable probability distribution or
bipartite bound information exists.

controlled manner. The approach consists of having a pair of initially
nonentangled detectors locally interact with the field for a finite duration,
such that the two detectors remain causally disconnected, and then analyzing
the resulting detector mixed state. It is demonstrated that the correlations
between arbitrarily far-apart regions of the vacuum of a relativistic free
scalar field cannot be reproduced by a local hidden-variable model, and that as
a function of the distance L between the regions, the entanglement decreases at
a slower rate than exp(-(L/cT)^3).

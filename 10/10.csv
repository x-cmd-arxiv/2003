pixel-by-pixel convolution. In addition, Asymfast can be used to estimate the
effective circularized beam transfer functions of CMB instruments with
non-symmetric main beam. This is shown using realistic simulations and by
comparison to analytical approximations which are available for Gaussian
elliptical beams. Finally, the application of this technique to Archeops data

quasars are found to lie between $\simeq10^{7}\Msun$ and an upper limit of
$\simeq 3\times 10^{9}\Msun$, entirely consistent with the largest black-hole
masses found to date in the local Universe. The estimated Eddington ratios of
the broad-line quasars (FWHM\geq 2000 kms^{-1}) show a clear upper boundary at
$L_{bol}/L_{Edd}\simeq 1$, suggesting that the Eddington luminosity is still a
relevant physical limit to the accretion rate of luminous broad-line quasars at
$z\leq 2$. By combining the black-hole mass distribution of the SDSS quasars
with the 2dF quasar luminosity function, the number density of active black
holes at $z\simeq 2$ is estimated as a function of mass. In addition, we
independently estimate the local black-hole mass function for early-types using
the $M_{bh}-\sigma$ and $M_{bh}-L_{bulge}$ correlations. Based on the SDSS
velocity dispersion function and the 2MASS $K-$band luminosity function, both
estimates are found to be consistent at the high-mass end ($M_{bh}\geq

semi-analytic techniques to follow the formation, the evolution and the
chemical enrichment of cluster galaxies in a Lambda-CDM Universe. We model the
transport of metals between the stars, the cold gas in galaxies, the hot gas in
dark matter haloes, and the intergalactic gas outside virialized haloes. We
have compared three different feedback schemes. The `retention' model assumes
that material reheated by supernova explosions is able to leave the galaxy, but
not the dark matter halo. The `ejection' model assumes that this material
leaves the halo and is then re-incorporated when structure collapses on larger
scales. The `wind' model uses prescriptions that are motivated by observations
of local starburst galaxies. We require that our models reproduce the cluster
LF from the 2dF survey, the relations between stellar mass, gas mass and
metallicity inferred from new SDSS data, and the observed amount of metals in
the ICM. With suitable adjustment of the free parameters in the model, a
reasonable fit to the observational results at redshift zero can be obtained
for all three feedback schemes. All three predict that the chemical enrichment
of the ICM occurs at high redshift with 60-80 per cent of the metals currently
in the ICM ejected at redshifts larger than 1. Massive galaxies are important
contributors to the chemical pollution. The observed decline in baryon fraction
from rich clusters to galaxy groups is reproduced only in an `extreme' ejection
scheme, where material ejected from dark matter haloes is re-incorporated on a
timescale comparable to the age of the Universe. We explore how the metal
abundance in the intergalactic medium as a function of redshift can constraint
how and when galaxies ejected their metals.

Wavelet (SMHW). The skewness and the kurtosis of the SMHW coefficients are
calculated at different scales. A non-Gaussian signal is detected at scales of
the SMHW around 4 deg (size in the sky of around 10 deg). The right tail
probability of the detection is approx. 0.4%. In addition, a study of
Gaussianity is performed in each hemisphere. The northern hemisphere is
compatible with Gaussianity, whereas the southern one deviates from Gaussianity
with a right tail probability of approx. 0.1%. Systematics, foregrounds and
uncertainties in the estimation of the cosmological parameters are carefully
studied in order to identify the possible source of non-Gaussianity. The
detected deviation from Gaussianity is not found to be caused by systematic
effects: 1) each one of the Q, V and W receivers shows the same non-Gaussianity
pattern, and 2) several combinations of the different receivers at each
frequency band do not show this non-Gaussian pattern. Similarly, galactic
foregrounds show a negligible contribution to the non-Gaussian detection:
non-Gaussianity is detected in all the WMAP maps and no frequency dependence is
observed. Moreover, the expected foreground contribution to the combined WMAP
map was added to CMB Gaussian simulations showing a behaviour compatible with
the Gaussian model. Influence of uncertainties in the CMB power spectrum
estimation are also quantified. Hence, possible intrinsic temperature

quantify the contamination that remains. The GC systems of all three galaxies
have color distributions with at least two peaks and show modest negative color
gradients. The proportions of blue GCs range from 60-70% of the total
populations. The GC specific frequency (S_N) of NGC4406 is 3.5+/-0.5, 20% lower

sample of 145 stars with masses between 0.4 and >10 Msun (median mass 2.1 Msun)
located in the Orion star-forming complex. These measurements have been
supplemented with data from the literature for Orion stars with masses as low
as 0.1 Msun. The primary finding from analysis of these data is that the upper
envelope of the observed values of angular momentum per unit mass (J/M) varies
as M^0.25 for stars on convective tracks having masses in the range ~0.1 to ~3
Msun. This power law extends smoothly into the domain of more massive stars (3
to 10 Msun), which in Orion are already on the ZAMS. This result stands in
sharp contrast to the properties of main sequence stars, which show a break in
the power law and a sharp decline in J/M with decreasing mass for stars with M
<2 Msun. A second result of our study is that this break is seen already among
the PMS stars in our Orion sample that are on radiative tracks, even though
these stars are only a few million years old. A comparison of rotation rates
seen for stars on either side of the convective-radiative boundary shows that
stars do not rotate as solid bodies during the transition from convective to
radiative tracks.

After correcting for the effects of extinction and crowding, a mean apparent

$M_V=0.56\pm 0.06$ for M5-like stars derived from Baade-Wesselink analyses,
main sequence fitting, Fourier parameters and the trigonometric parallax of RR
Lyrae, we derive an LMC distance modulus $\mu=18.43\pm 0.06$ (statistical) $\pm

luminosities. Consequently, most of the gas surrounding the first stars will
leave the dark halo whether or not the stars produce supernovae. If they form
the first massive seed black holes these are unlikely to accrete within a

about two thirds of the systems could have such a planet confined to the HZ for

respect to iron ([Pb/Fe]= +3.5), and also with respect to the second peak
s-process elements (e.g., Ba, La, Ce, Nd), which fits into the newly introduced
classification of lead (Pb) stars. The known spectroscopic binary status of
this star, along with the observed s-process abundance pattern, suggest that it
has accreted matter from a companion, which formerly was an Asymptotic

broad absorption lines of metallic species that suggest a large axial
rotational velocity for this star, which may be the result of spin-up
associated with the accretion of material from its previous AGB companion. In
addition, this star is clearly depleted in the light element Li. When

The main point of this crisis
is that number of substructures presented by cosmological N-body simulations
based on CDM scenario for structure formation is much larger than observed
substructures. Therefore, it is crucial for this crisis to discriminate whether
expected number of CDM substructures really exist but non-luminous or do not
exist.
  In this paper, we present a new idea to detect such invisible substructures
by utilizing a gravitational lensing. Here, we consider quasars that are
gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy. A substructure around the
lensing galaxy may superposed on one of the lensed images of such quasars. In
this situation, additional image splitting should occur in the image behind the
substructure, and further multiple images are created. This is ``quasar
mesolensing''.
  We estimate separation and time delay between further multiple images due to
quasar mesolensing. The expected value is $1 \sim 30$ milli-arcsecond for the
separation and future fine resolution imaging enable us to find invisible
substructures, and is $1 \sim 10^3$ second for the time delay and high-speed
monitoring of such quasar will be able to find ``echo''-like variation due to
quasar mesolensing in intrinsic variability of the quasar. Furthermore, we
evaluate that the optical depth for the quasar mesolensing is $\sim 0.1$.
Consequently, if we monitor a few multiple quasars, we can find ``echo''-like
variation in one of the images after intrinsic flux variations of quasars.

pulsar known: PSR B1937+21. The ~200 ks observation (78.5 ks MECS/34 ks LECS
on-source time) allowed us to investigate with high statistical significance
both the spectral properties and the pulse profile shape. The pulse profile is
clearly double peaked at energies > ~4 keV. Peak widths are compatible with the
instrumental time resolution and the second pulse lags the main pulse 0.52 in
phase, like is the case in the radio. In the 1.3-4 keV band we detect a ~45% DC
component; conversely the 4-10 keV pulsed fraction is consistent with 100%. The
on-pulse spectrum is fitted with an absorbed power-law of spectral index ~1.2,
harder than that of the total flux which is ~1.9. The total unabsorbed (2-10
keV) flux is F_{2-10} = 4.1 10^-13 cgs, implying a luminosity of L_X = 5.0
10^31 \Theta (d/3.6 kpc)^2 erg s^-1 and a X-ray efficiency of \eta = 4.5 10^-5
\Theta, where \Theta is the solid angle spanned by the emission beam. These
results are in agreement with those obtained by ASCA and a more recent
Rossi-XTE observation. The hydrogen column density N_H ~2 10^22 cm^-2 is ~10
times higher than expected from the radio dispersion measure and average
Galactic density of e-. Though it is compatible (within 2\sigma) with the
Galactic (HI derived) value of ~1 10^22 cm^-2, inspection of dust extinction
maps reveal that the pulsar falls in a highly absorbed region. In addition, 1.4
GHz radio map shows that the nearby (likely unrelated) HII source 4C21.53W is
part of a circular emission region ~4' across.

previously that some spin-flavor mixed-symmetric baryon states have strong
couplings of O(N_c^{-1/2}) to nucleons [implying narrow widths of O(1/N_c)], as
opposed to the generic expectation based on Witten's counting rules of an
O(N_c^0) coupling. The calculation obtaining these narrow widths was performed
in the context of a simple quark-shell model. This paper addresses the question
of whether the existence of such narrow states is a general property of large
N_c QCD. We show that a general large N_c QCD analysis does not predict such
narrow states; rather they are a consequence of the extreme simplicity of the

numerically and analytically solve in the energy range $[m_{t},E_{GU}]$ where
$m_{t}$ is the mass of the top quark and $E_{GU}=10^{14}$ GeV. We find that
depending on the value of $\lambda_{H}(m_{t})$ the solution for
$\lambda_{H}(E)$ may have singularities or zeros and become negative in the
former energy range so the ultra violet cut off of the standard model should be
below the energy where the zero or singularity of $\lambda_{H}$ occurs. We find
that for $0.369\leq\lambda_{H}(m_{t})\leq0.613$ the Standard Model is valid in
the whole range $[m_{t},E_{GU}]$. We consider two cases of the Higgs mass

$\lambda_{H}(m_{t})$ correspond to the following Higgs mass relation $150\leq

the cases (a) and (b). The behavior of $\lambda_{H}(E)$, $m_{H}(E)$ and $v(E)$
indicates the existence of a phase transition in the standard model. For the

and find good agreement at short distances, once the renormalon ambiguities are
accounted for. We use the non-perturbatively determined continuum-limit static
hybrid and ground state potentials at short distances to determine the gluelump
energies. The result is consistent with an estimate obtained from the gluelump
data at finite lattice spacings. For the lightest gluelump, we obtain
Lambda_B^{RS}(nu_f=2.5/r_0)=[2.25\pm 0.10(latt.)\pm 0.21 (th.)\pm 0.08

We show that, to quote sensible numbers for the absolute values of the gluelump
energies, it is necessary to handle the singularities of the singlet and octet
potentials in the Borel plane. We propose to subtract the renormalons of the
short-distance matching coefficients, the potentials in this case. For the
singlet potential the leading renormalon is already known and related to that
of the pole mass, for the octet potential a new renormalon appears, which we
approximately evaluate. We also apply our methods to heavy light mesons in the
static limit and from the lattice simulations available in the literature we

""Structured ring spectra and their applications"" which took place January
21-25, 2002, at the University of Glasgow.
  The term `Morita theory' is usually used for results concerning equivalences
of various kinds of module categories. We focus on the covariant form of Morita
theory, so the basic question is: When do two `rings' have `equivalent' module
categories ?
  We discuss this question in different contexts and illustrate it by examples:
  (Classical) When are the module categories of two rings equivalent as
categories ?
  (Derived) When are the derived categories of two rings equivalent as
triangulated categories ?
  (Homotopical) When are the module categories of two ring spectra Quillen
equivalent as model categories ?
  There is always a related question, which is in a sense more general: What
characterizes the category of modules over a `ring' ?
  The answer is, mutatis mutandis, always the same: modules over a `ring' are
characterized by the existence of a `small generator', which plays the role of
the free module of rank one. The precise meaning of `small generator' depends
on the context, be it an abelian category, a derived category or a stable model
category.

mixing is equivalent to multiplicative mixing of complex signal sources within
distinct spectral bands. We decompose the recorded spectral-domain signals into
independent components by a complex infomax ICA algorithm. First results from a

targeting"" wherein the goal is to pass a test for a target state even though
the system upon which the test is performed is submitted prior to learning the

some control over the outcome of the test. We show that increasing one's
control above a minimum amount implies an unavoidable increase in the
probability of failing the test. This is analogous to the unavoidable
disturbance to a quantum state that results from gaining information about its
identity, and can be shown to be a purely quantum effect. We provide some
applications of the results to the security analysis of cryptographic tasks
implemented between remote antagonistic parties. Although we focus on weak coin
flipping, the results are significant for other two-party protocols, such as
strong coin flipping, partially binding and concealing bit commitment, and bit
escrow. Furthermore, the results have significance not only for the traditional
notion of security in cryptography, that of restricting a cheater's ability to
bias the outcome of the protocol, but also on a novel notion of security that
arises only in the quantum context, that of cheat-sensitivity. Finally, our
analysis of state targeting leads to some interesting secondary results, for

"quant-ph/0310064","Wellington da Cruz","Wellington da Cruz, S. Shelly Sharma","Entanglement measure for the universal classes of fractons","latex, 11 pages. Final version to appear in PHYSICA A (2004)",,,"preprint-DF/UEL/0310001","quant-ph",,"  We introduce the notion of entanglement measure for the universal classes of
fractons as an entanglement between ocuppation-numbers of fractons in the
lowest Landau levels and the rest of the many-body system of particles. This
definition came as an entropy of the probability distribution {\it \`a la}
Shannon. Fractons are charge-flux systems classified in universal classes of
particles or quasiparticles labelled by a fractal or Hausdorff dimension
defined within the interval $1 < h < 2$ and associated with the fractal quantum
curves of such objects. They carry rational or irrational values of spin and
the spin-statistics connection takes place in this fractal approach to the
fractional spin particles. We take into account the fractal von Neumann entropy
associated with the fractal distribution function which each universal class of
fractons satisfies. We consider the fractional quantum Hall effect-FQHE given
that fractons can model Hall states. According to our formulation entanglement
between occupaton-numbers in this context increases with the universality
classes of the quantum Hall transitions considered as fractal sets of dual
topological quantum numbers filling factors. We verify that the Hall states
have stronger entanglement between ocuppation-numbers and so we can consider
this resource for fracton quantum computing.

  downconversion","10 pages, 8 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Measurement of photon-number statistics of fields composed of photon pairs
generated in spontaneous parametric downcoversion pumped by strong ultrashort
pulses is described. Final detection quantum efficiencies, noises as well as
possible loss of one or both photons from a pair are taken into account.
Measured data provided by an intensified single-photon CCD camera are analyzed
along the developed model. The joint signal-idler photon-number distribution is
obtained using the expectation maximization algorithm. Covariance of the signal
and idler photon-numbers equals 80 %. Statistics of the generated photon pairs
are identified to be Poissonian in our case. Distribution of the integrated
intensities of the signal and idler fields shows strong correlations between
the fields. Negative values of this distribution occurring in some regions
clearly demonstrate a nonclassical character of the light composed of photon
pairs.

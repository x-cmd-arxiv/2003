affecting imaging data taken with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) at the MPG/ESO
2.2 m telescope at the European Southern Observatory at La Silla in Chile. Such
smoothly varying, large-scale gradients are primarily caused by non-uniform
illumination due to stray light, which cannot be removed using standard
flatfield procedures. By comparing our observations to the well-calibrated,
homogeneous multi-colour photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we
characterise the intensity gradients across the camera by second-order
polynomials. The application of these polynomials to our data removes the
gradients and reduces the overall scatter. We also demonstrate that applying
our correction to an independent WFI dataset significantly reduces its
large-scale variations, indicating that our prescription provides a generally
valid and simple tool for calibrating WFI photometry.

initial seed poloidal field is present. The resulting magnetic stresses, along
with viscosity, drive the star toward uniform rotation. This magnetic braking
has important dynamical consequences in many astrophysical contexts. For
example, merging binary neutron stars can form ""hypermassive"" remnants
supported against collapse by differential rotation. The removal of this
support by magnetic braking induces radial fluid motion, which can lead to
delayed collapse of the remnant to a black hole. We explore the effects of
magnetic braking and viscosity on the structure of a differentially rotating,
compressible star, generalizing our earlier calculations for incompressible
configurations. The star is idealized as a differentially rotating, infinite
cylinder supported initially by a polytropic equation of state. The gas is
assumed to be infinitely conducting and our calculations are performed in
Newtonian gravitation. Though highly idealized, our model allows for the
incorporation of magnetic fields, viscosity, compressibility, and shocks with
minimal computational resources in a 1+1 dimensional Lagrangian MHD code. Our
evolution calculations show that magnetic braking can lead to significant
structural changes in a star, including quasistatic contraction of the core and
ejection of matter in the outermost regions to form a wind or an ambient disk.
These calculations serve as a prelude and a guide to more realistic MHD
simulations in full 3+1 general relativity.

investigate the critical behavior the temperature and field dependence of
several quantities are studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. On the

the numerical data are analyzed in the framework of a finite-size scaling

find that there are two regimes of behavior, a symmetric regime for smooth

conductors, the locations of the charges can be determined up to a certain
order by an integral equation due to Pommerenke (1969). We present a derivation
of a related (but different) integral equation, which has the same solutions.
We also solve the equation to obtain (asymptotic) solutions which show
universal behavior in the distribution of the charges in conductors with
somewhat smooth cusps. Conductors with sharp cusps and singularities show
qualitatively different behavior, where the symmetry of the problem is broken,
and the distribution of the discrete charges does not respect the symmetry of
the underlying domain. We investigate the symmetry breaking both theoretically,
and numerically, and find good agreement between our theory and the numerics.
We also find that the universality in the distribution of the charges near the
cusps persists in the symmetry broken regime, although this distribution is
very different from the one given by the integral equation.

The spin-dependent interplay between the drift current (due to a source-drain

gate) results in a rich variety of spin dependence in the current that flows
through such a device. We examine two cases of particular interest: (1)
creating a 100% spin-polarized electrical current and (2) creating a pure spin
current without a net electrical current. A spin-valve consisting of two
sequential ferromagnetic gates is shown to exhibit magnetoresistance dependent
upon the relative orientations of the magnetization of the two ferromagnets.
The magnetoresistance ratio grows to arbitrarily large values in the regime of
low source-drain bias, and is limited only by the spin-flip time in the

fine-tuning, mainly due to the smallness of the tree-level Higgs quartic
coupling, lambda_tree. Hence the fine tuning is efficiently reduced in
supersymmetric models with larger lambda_tree, as happens naturally when the
breaking of SUSY occurs at a low scale (not far from the TeV). We show, in
general and with specific examples, that a dramatic improvement of the fine
tuning (so that there is virtually no fine-tuning) is indeed a very common
feature of these scenarios for wide ranges of tan(beta) and the Higgs mass
(which can be as large as several hundred GeV if desired, but this is not
necessary). The supersymmetric flavour problems are also drastically improved
due to the absence of RG cross-talk between soft mass parameters.

numerically by showing that the radiation emitted from the collision of an

Consequently, processes changing the boundary charges are practically
unavoidable in this system. We speculate that the system has a universal final

produce a non-trivial fixed point with the correct string susceptibility
exponent and the expected logarithmic scaling violation of the $c=1$ theory.
The change of world-sheet free energy with length scale indicates a sign change
as we increase the temperature, indicating a phase transition due to liberation
of the non-singlet states. At low temperature, the RG analysis also lead to
T-duality of the singlet sector free energy. The RG flow to the $c=1$ fixed
point can be understood as the decay of unstable $D0$-branes with open string
rolling tachyon to the 2D closed string theory described by the end point of
the flow. The amplitude of the decay is extracted from the change of the

bundle to be quasi very ample if it yields a birational morphism which is a

rho^0_L invariant mass distributions for all three nuclei in a manner which is
less model-dependent than previous measurements. The results are compared to
kinematic and phenomenological models of the rho^0 spectral function. The 2H

the in-medium rho^0_L invariant mass distribution, while the 12C distributions

collisions in a model independent way is proposed within the hydrodynamic
approach. It makes it possible to extract a chemical potential of thermal pions
at freeze out irrespective of the form of freeze-out (isothermal) hypersurface
in Minkowski space and transverse flows on it. The contributions of resonance
(with masses up to 2 GeV) decays to spectra, interferometry volumes and
phase-space densities are calculated and discussed in detail. The estimates of
average phase-space densities and chemical potentials of thermal pions are
obtained for SPS and RHIC energies. They demonstrate that multibosonic
phenomena at those energies might be considered as a correction factor rather
than as a significant physical effect. The analysis of the evolution of the
pion average phase-space density in chemically frozen hadron systems shows that
it is almost constant or slightly increases with time while the particle
density and phase-space density at each space point drops down rapidly during
the system's expansion. We found that, unlike the particle density, the average
phase-space density has no direct link to the freeze-out criterion and final
thermodynamic parameters, being connected rather to the initial phase-space
density of hadronic matter formed in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions.

galaxy clusters in a LambdaCDM universe and investigate how the characteristics
of CDM clusters determine the properties of the arcs they generate. Due to the
triaxiality and substructure of CDM halos, the giant arc cross section for
individual clusters varies by more than an order of magnitude as a function of
viewing angle. In addition, the shallow density cusps and triaxiality of CDM
clusters cause systematic alignments of giant arcs which should be testable
with larger samples from forthcoming lensing surveys. We compute the predicted
statistics of giant arcs for the LambdaCDM model and compare to results from
previous surveys. The predicted arc statistics are in excellent agreement with
the numbers of giant arcs observed around low redshift (0.2 < z < 0.6) clusters
from the EMSS sample, however there are hints of a possible excess of arcs
observed around high redshift z > 0.6 clusters. This excess, if real, appears
to be due to the presence of highly massive or concentrated clusters at high
redshifts.

Our most robust estimate is a weighted mean da/a=(-0.57 +/- 0.11)x10^{-5}. We
respond to recent criticisms of the many-multiplet method used to extract these
constraints. The most important potential systematic error at low-z is the
possibility of very different Mg heavy isotope abundances in the absorption
clouds and laboratory: {\it higher} abundances of {25,26}Mg in the absorbers
may explain the low-z results. Approximately equal mixes of {24}Mg and
{25,26}Mg are required. Observations of Galactic stars generally show {\it
lower} {25,26}Mg isotope fractions at the low metallicities typifying the
absorbers. Higher values can be achieved with an enhanced population of
intermediate mass stars at high redshift, a possibility at odds with observed
absorption system element abundances. At present, all observational evidence is
consistent with the varying-alpha results.
  Another promising method to search for variation of fundamental constants
involves comparing different atomic clocks. Here we calculate the dependence of
nuclear magnetic moments on quark masses and obtain limits on the variation of
alpha and m_q/Lambda_QCD from recent atomic clock experiments with hyperfine
transitions in H, Rb, Cs, Hg+ and an optical transition in Hg+.

the association of GRB980425 with SN1998bw and of GRB030329 with SN2003dh.
While the gamma-ray luminosity of GRB030329 was typical to cosmological GRBs,
the luminosity of the nearby (40 Mpc) GRB980425 was ~5 orders of magnitude
lower. The large luminosity difference is commonly explained by hypothesizing
that either SNe Ib/c produce two different classes of GRBs, or that GRB980425
was a typical cosmological GRB jet viewed off-axis. In the latter scenario,
strong radio emission, ~10^{30} erg/s Hz, is expected at ~1 yr delay due to jet
deceleration to sub-relativistic speed, as observed from GRB970508. The radio
luminosity of SN1998bw was 3 orders of magnitude lower than this value. We show
that the low radio flux may be consistent with the off-axis jet interpretation,
if the density of the wind surrounding the progenitor is lower than typically
expected, \dot{m}=(\dot{M}/10^{-5} M_sun/yr)/(v/10^3 km/s)~0.1 instead of
\dot{m}>=1. The lower value of \dot{m} is consistent with the observed radio
emission from the supernova shock driven into the wind. This interpretation
predicts transition to sub-relativistic expansion at ~10 yr delay, with current
\~1 mJy 10GHz flux and m_V~23 optical flux, and with ~10 mas angular source
size. It also implies that in order to search for the signature of off-axis
GRBs associated with nearby Ib/c supernovae, follow up observations should be
carried on a multi-yr time scale.

protoplanetary disk. The results of two different numerical approaches are
presented and compared. In the first approach, the motion of the disk material
is computed with viscous hydrodynamical simulations, and the planetary motion
is determined by N-body calculations including exactly the gravitational forces
exerted by the disk material. In the second approach, only the N-body
integration is performed but with additional dissipative forces included such
as to mimic the effect of the disk torques acting on the disk. This type of
modeling is much faster than the full hydrodynamical simulations, and gives
comparative results provided that parameters are adjusted properly.
  Resonant capture of the planets is seen in both approaches, where the order
of the resonance depends on the properties of the disk and the planets.
Resonant capture leads to a rise in the eccentricity and to an alignment of the
spatial orientation of orbits. The numerical results are compared with the
observed planetary systems in mean motion resonance (Gl 867, HD 82943, and 55
Cnc). We find that the forcing together of two planets by their parent disk
produces resonant configurations similar to those observed, but that
eccentricity damping greater than that obtained in our hydrodynamic simulations
is required to match the GJ 876 observations.

is self-consistently produced by the interaction of an accretion disk with an
open, initially bent large-scale magnetic field. A constant fraction of heated
disk material is launched in the inner equipartition disk regions, leading to
the formation of a hot corona and a bright collimated, super-fastmagnetosonic
jet. We illustrate the complete dynamics of the ``hot'' near steady-state
outflow (where thermal pressure $\simeq$ magnetic pressure) by showing force
balance, energy budget and current circuits. The evolution to this near
stationary state is analyzed in terms of the temporal variation of energy
fluxes controlling the energetics of the accretion disk. We find that unlike
advection-dominated accretion flow, the energy released by accretion is mainly
sent into the jet rather than transformed into disk enthalpy. These magnetized,
radiatively inefficient accretion-ejection structures can account for
under-luminous thin disks supporting bright fast collimated jets as seen in
many systems displaying jets (for instance M87).

recently been demonstrated experimentally for a simple system in a transient

between the stochastic motion of the particle in water and its deterministic

Cooperator population or several competing cliques. After taking into account
that Cooperators bear costs necessary to recognize members of one's own group

air motion in the freezing chamber (which promotes evaporative cooling), 3) the
quantity of dissolved salts in the water, and 4) the size, shape, and composing

formation is greatest when the air temperature is near -7 C, the water is pure,
and the air in the freezing chamber is moving. Even small quantities of
dissolved solids greatly reduce the probability of ice spike formation. Under
optimal conditions, approximately half the ice cubes in an ordinary ice cube
tray will form ice spikes.
  Guided by these observations, we have examined the Bally-Dorsey model for the
formation of ice spikes. In this model, the density change during
solidification forces supercooled water up through a hollow ice tube, where it
freezes around the rim to lengthen the tube. We propose that any dissolved
solids in the water will tend to concentrate at the tip of a growing ice spike
and inhibit its growth. This can qualitatively explain the observation that ice
spikes do not readily form using water containing even small quantities of
dissolved solids.

of the signal-to-noise analysis (SCSNA). The signal-to-noise analysis must
assume that crosstalk noise of an input to spins obeys a Gaussian distribution.

respect to the stationary state in the case where the dynamics is

the number of steps, and converges to alpha_c=0.269 at l ~= 10. The original

supergravity. The Wheeler-DeWitt equation is proposed to generate the extended
RG flow and to produce 1/N subleading corrections systematically. Our
formulation in five dimensions is applied to the derivation of the Weyl anomaly
of boundary N=4 SU(N) super-Yang-Mills theory beyond the large N limit. It is
shown that subleading 1/N^2 corrections arising from fields in AdS_5
supergravity agree with those obtained recently by Mansfield et al. using their
Schroedinger equation, thereby guaranteeing to reproduce the exact form of the
boundary Weyl anomaly after summing up all of the KK modes.

  with Monte-Carlo simulations in 't Hooft limit","21 pages, 8 figures",,,,"hep-th",,"  In recent work, we have developed a variational principle for large N
multi-matrix models based on the extremization of non-commutative entropy.
Here, we test the simplest variational ansatz for our entropic variational
principle with Monte-Carlo measurements. In particular, we study the two matrix
model with action Tr[{m^2 \over 2} (A_1^2 + A_2^2) - {1 \over 4} [A_1,A_2]^2]
which has not been exactly solved. We estimate the expectation values of traces
of products of matrices and also those of traces of products of exponentials of
matrices (Wilson loop operators). These are compared with a Monte-Carlo
simulation. We find that the simplest wignerian variational ansatz provides a
remarkably good estimate for observables when $m^2$ is of order unity or more.
For small values of m^2 the wignerian ansatz is not a good approximation: the
measured correlations grow without bound, reflecting the non-convergence of
matrix integrals defining the pure commutator squared action. Comparison of
this ansatz with the exact solution of a two matrix model studied by Mehta is
also summarized. Here the wignerian ansatz is a good approximation both for
strong and weak coupling.

the earth as flat, and tell us that the particle moves in a parabola. The

a small segment of the true central-force/ellipse orbit. To look more deeply
into this connection we convert earth-centered polar coordinates to
``flat-earth coordinates'' by treating radial lines as vertical, and by
treating lines of constant radial distance as horizontal. With the exact
trajectory and dynamics in this system, we consider such questions as whether
gravity is purely vertical in this picture, and whether the central force
nature of gravity is important only when the height or range of a ballistic
trajectory is comparable to the earth radius. Somewhat surprisingly, the
answers to both questions is ``no,'' and therein lie some interesting lessons.

spectroscopy for clusters in NGCs 3379, 4649, 524, 7332, and IC 1459. We find a
clear bimodality in the NGC 4649 cluster colour distribution, with the fraction
of blue/red clusters increasing with galactocentric radius. We derive ages and
metallicities for 22 clusters in NGC 3379, finding that most of the clusters
appear old (10-15 Gyr); however, there is a group of 4 metal-rich, younger
clusters with ages of 2-6 Gyr. The NGC 3379 cluster velocity dispersion
decreases with radius, as does the inferred (local) mass-to-light ratio: there
is no evidence for a dark matter halo in NGC 3379 based on our globular cluster
data.

that the differences are mainly due to a separation in [alpha/Fe] between thin

a chemical separation between the thick and the thin disk is obtained from

is approximately spatial local in the $x$-$k$ (position-scale) phase space if
the initial perturbations are Gaussian. That is, if viewing the mass field with
modes in the phase space, the nonlinear evolution will cause strong coupling
among modes with different scale $k$, but at the same spatial area $x$, while
the modes at different area $x$ remain uncorrelated, or very weakly correlated.
We first study the quasi-local clustering behavior with the halo model, and
demonstrate that the quasi-local evolution in the phase space is essentially
due to the self-similar and hierarchical features of the cosmic gravitational
clustering. The scaling of mass density profile of halos insures that the
coupling between $(x-k)$ modes at different physical positions is substantially
suppressed. Using high resolution N-body simulation samples in the LCDM model,
we justify the quasi-locality with the correlation function between the DWT
(discrete wavelet transform) variables of the cosmic mass field. Although the
mass field underwent a highly non-linear evolution, and the DWT variables
display significantly non-Gaussian features, there are almost no correlations
among the DWT variables at different spatial positions. Possible applications
of the quasi-locality have been discussed.

to study the sulphur chemistry, i.e. how the relative abundances change in the
different physical conditions found in L1689N. We identified eight interesting

cloud (as reference position), five shocked regions caused by the interaction
of the molecular outflows with the cloud, and the two protostars IRAS16293-2422
and 16293E. In the cloud we carefully computed the gas temperature and density
by means of a non-LTE LVG code, while in other regions we used previous
results. We hence derived the column density of SO, SO2 and H2S, together with
SiO and H2CO - which were observed previously - and their relevant abundance
ratios. We find that SiO is the molecule that shows the largest abundance
variations in the shocked regions, whereas S-bearing molecules show more
moderate variations. Remarkably, the region of the brightest SiO emission in
L1689N is undetected in SO2, H2S and H2CO and only marginally detected in SO.
In the other weaker SiO shocks, SO2 is enhanced with respect to SO. We propose
a schema in which the different molecular ratios correspond to different ages

Circumnuclear Disk (CND) in the Galactic Center and a putative, geometrically
thick, obscuring torus are best explained by a collisional model consisting of
quasi-stable, self-gravitating clouds. Kinetic energy of clouds is gained by
mass inflow and dissipated in cloud collisions. The collisions give rise to a
viscosity in a spatially averaged gas dynamical picture, which connects them to
angular momentum transport and mass inflow. It is found that CND and torus
share the same gas physics in our description, where the mass of clouds is 20 -
50 M_sun and their density is close to the limit of disruption by tidal shear.
We show that the difference between a transparent CND and an obscuring torus is
the gas mass and the velocity dispersion of the clouds. A change in gas supply
and the dissipation of kinetic energy can turn a torus into a CND-like
structure and vice versa. Any massive torus will naturally lead to sufficiently
high mass accretion rates to feed a luminous AGN. For a geometrically thick
torus to obscure the view to the center even super-Eddington accretions rates
with respect to the central black hole are required.

quasiparticles that obey nonabelian quantum statistics. The most prominent
example is the Moore-Read model for the $\nu=5/2$ state, in which the ground
state is a superconductor of composite fermions, and the charged excitations
are vortices in that superconductor. In this paper we develop a physical
picture of the nonabelian statistics of these vortices. Considering first the
positions of the vortices as fixed, we define a set of single-particle states
at and near the core of each vortex, and employ general properties of the
corresponding Bogolubov-deGennes equations to write the ground states in the
Fock space defined by these single-particle states. We find all ground states
to be entangled superpositions of all possible occupations of the
single-particle states near the vortex cores, in which the probability for all
occupations is equal, and the relative phases vary from one ground state to
another. Then, we examine the evolution of the ground states as the positions
of the vortices are braided. We find that as vortices move, they accumulate a
geometric phase that depends on the occupations of the single-particle states
near the cores of other vortices. Thus, braiding of vortices changes the
relative phase between different components of a superposition, in which the
occupations of the single-particle states differ, and hence transform the
system from one ground state to another. These transformations are the source
of the nonabelian statistics. Finally, by exploring a ""self-similar"" form of
the many-body wave functions of the ground states, we show the equivalence of
our picture and pictures derived previously, in which vortex braiding seemingly
affects the occupations of states in the cores of the vortices.

mobility drastically. For a vortex wall the domain wall mobility is described
by the Walker-formula, with a domain wall width depending on the diameter of

two branches. For one branch the current octupole moment of the analytic

spacetime; the other branch is more similar to the Kerr solution. We present an
extensive comparison of the radii of innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs)
obtained with a) the analytic solution, b) the Kerr metric, c) an analytic

of Monoidal Fuzzy Logics by first proving and then using relational
inequalities over pseudo-associative BK-products (compositions) of relations in
these logics.
  In 1977 Bandler and Kohout introduced generalized homomorphism,
proteromorphism, amphimorphism, forward and backward compatibility of
relations, and non-associative and pseudo-associative products (compositions)
of relations into crisp (non-fuzzy Boolean) theory of relations. This was
generalized later by Kohout to relations based on fuzzy Basic Logic systems
(BL) of H\'ajek and also for relational systems based on left-continuous
t-norms.
  The present paper is based on monoidal logics, hence it subsumes as special
cases the theories of generalized morphisms (etc.) based on the following
systems of logics: BL systems (which include the well known Goedel, product
logic systems; Lukasiewicz logic and its extension to MV-algebras related to
quantum logics), intuitionistic logics and linear logics.

ACQP. Methods of MCQP in investigation of quantum phenomena appear to be more
subtle and effective than, that of ACQP. For instance, investigation of the
free Dirac equation in framework of MCQP shows that the Dirac particle is in
reality a rotator, i.e. two particles rotating around their common center of

  Classical Statistical Mechanics","15 pages, no figures; prepared with Scientific Word",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.flu-dyn",,"  The possibility to derive an equation for the mean velocity field in
turbulent flow by using classical statistical mechanics is investigated. An
application of projection operator technique available in the literature is
used for this purpose. It is argued that the hydrodynamic velocity defined
there, in situations where the fluid is turbulent, is to be interpreted as the
mean velocity field; in that case, the momentum component of the generalized
transport equation derived there is the mean velocity equation. In this paper,
stationary incompressible flow for constant mass density and temperature is
considered. The stress tensor is obtained as a nonlinear functional of the mean
velocity field, the linear part of which is the Stokes tensor. The formula
contains a time correlation function in local equilibrium. Presently, there
exists a microscopic theory for time correlations in total equilibrium only.
For this reason and as a preliminary measure, the formula has been expanded
into a power series in the mean velocity; though this limits the applicability
to low Reynolds number flow. The second order term has been evaluated in a
former paper of the author. For the third order term, the form of the kernel
function is derived. Its calculation with the aid of the mode-coupling theory
is completed; it will be reported in an separate paper. An numerical
application with the data of the circular jet is under way.

argued that distinguishing between two slits a distance s apart gives the
particle a random momentum transfer \wp of order h/s. This was accepted for
more than 60 years, until Scully, Englert and Walther (SEW) proposed a
which-way scheme that, they claimed, entailed no momentum transfer. Storey,
Tan, Collett and Walls (STCW) in turn proved a theorem that, they claimed,
showed that Bohr was right. This work reviews and extends a recent proposal
[Wiseman, Phys. Lett. A 311, 285 (2003)] to resolve the issue using a
weak-valued probability distribution for momentum transfer, P_wv(\wp). We show
that P_wv(\wp) must be wider than h/6s. However, its moments can still be zero
because P_wv(\wp) is not necessarily positive definite. Nevertheless, it is
measurable in a way understandable to a classical physicist. We introduce a new
measure of spread for P_wv(\wp): half of the unit-confidence interval, and
conjecture that it is never less than h/4s. For an idealized example with
infinitely narrow slits, the moments of P_wv(\wp) and of the momentum
distributions are undefined unless a process of apodization is used. We show
that by considering successively smoother initial wave functions, successively
more moments of both P_wv(\wp) and the momentum distributions become defined.
For this example the moments of P_wv(\wp) are zero, and these are equal to the
changes in the moments of the momentum distribution. We prove that this
relation holds for schemes in which the moments of P_wv(\wp) are non-zero, but
only for the first two moments. We also compare these moments to those of two
other momentum-transfer distributions and \hat{p}_f-\hat{p}_i. We find
agreement between all of these, but again only for the first two moments.

  1/F Fluctuations","submitted to the journal: Fluctuation and Noise Letters, March 13,
  2003",,,,"quant-ph",,"  An overview of the concept of phase-locking at the non linear, geometric and
quantum level is attempted, in relation to finite resolution measurements in a
communication receiver and its 1/f noise. Sine functions, automorphic functions
and cyclotomic arithmetic are respectively used as the relevant trigonometric
tools. The common point of the three topics is found to be the Mangoldt
function of prime number theory as the generator of low frequency noise in the
coupling coefficient, the scattering coefficient and in quantum critical
statistical states. Huyghens coupled pendulums, the Adler equation, the Arnold
map, continued fraction expansions, discrete Mobius transformations, Ford
circles, coherent and squeezed phase states, Ramanujan sums, the Riemann zeta
function and Bost and Connes KMS states are some but a few concepts which are
used synchronously in the paper.

does {\bf not} introduce extra decoherence to the qubits until the measurement
is switched on by a resonant pulse. The resonant pulse then maximally entangles
the qubit with the detector. The scheme has the feature of being projective,
noiseless, and switchable. This method is illustrated on the superconducting
persistent-current qubit, but can be applied to the measurement of a wide
variety of solid-state qubits, the {\bf direct} detection of the
electromagnetic signals of which gives poor resolution of the qubit states.

optical cavities is applied to three resonator geometries: A one dimensional
dielectric, a Fabry--Perot resonator, and a dielectric disk. The
system--and--bath Hamiltonian for these geometries is derived starting from
Maxwell's equations and employed to compute the electromagnetic fields, the
resonances, and the cavity gain factors. Exact agreement is found with standard
quantization methods based on a modes--of--the--universe description. Our
analysis provides a microscopic justification for the system--and--bath
quantization even in the regime of spectrally overlapping modes.

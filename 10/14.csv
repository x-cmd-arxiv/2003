the reionisation history of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We use cosmological
simulations that include self-consistently the feedback from ionising
radiation, H_2 dissociating radiation and supernova (SN) explosions. We find
that it is difficult to reionise the IGM at z_rei>10 with stellar sources even
after making extreme assumptions. If star formation in 10^9 M_\odot galaxies is
not suppressed by SN explosions, the optical depth to Thomson scattering is
tau_e< 0.13. If we allow for the normal energy input from SNe or if
pair-instability SNe are dominant, we find taue<0.09. Assuming normal yields
for the first stars (popIII), the mean metallicity of the IGM is already
Z/Z_\odot=2x10^-3 (10^-3<Z/Z_\odot<1 in overdense regions) when the IGM mean
ionisation fraction is less than 10%. For these reasons popIII stars cannot
contribute significantly to reionisation unless the mechanical energy input
from SNe is greatly reduced and either the metal yield or the mixing efficiency
is reduced by a factor of 1000. Both problems have a solution if popIII stars
collapse to black holes. This can happen if, having masses M_*< 130 M_\odot,
they are characterised by heavy element fall-back or if, having masses M_*>260
M_\odot, they collapse directly onto black holes without exploding as SNe.If
metal-poor stars are initially important and collapse to black holes is the
typical outcome, then the secondary emission of ionising radiation from
accretion on SN induced seed black holes, might be more important than the
primary emission. Surprisingly, including feedback effects, we estimate that a
warm dark matter scenario (with particle mass of 1.25 keV) reduces tau_e by
only approximately 10%.[abridged]

collapse of the cluster tends to erase substructure, although some substructure
may persist beyond the collapse phase. In clusters with virial ratios of 0.5 or
higher, initial density substructure survives for several crossing times, in
virtually all cases. Even an initially homogeneous cluster can develop
substructure, if it is born with coherent velocity dispersion. These results

presence of broad absorption line systems. The time dependence of variability
(the structure function) is well-fit by a single power law on timescales from
days to years. There is an anti-correlation of variability amplitude with rest
wavelength, and quasars are systematically bluer when brighter at all
redshifts. There is a strong anti-correlation of variability with quasar
luminosity. There is also a significant positive correlation of variability
amplitude with redshift, indicating evolution of the quasar population or the
variability mechanism. We parameterize all of these relationships. Quasars with
RASS X-ray detections are significantly more variable (at optical/UV
wavelengths) than those without, and radio loud quasars are marginally more
variable than their radio weak counterparts. We find no significant difference

ingredient to predict the phenomenology of the low redshift universe. It has
been measured using several methods, such as X-ray cluster counts, weak lensing
and the cosmic microwave background, which have yielded values ranging from 0.7
to 1.0. While these differences could be due to systematic effects, they could
also be due to physics beyond the standard LambdaCDM model. An obvious
possibility is the presence of non-Gaussian initial fluctuations in the density
field. To study the impact of non-Gaussianity on each of these methods, we use
a generalised halo model to compute cluster counts and the non-linear power
spectrum for non-Gaussian models. Assuming scale invariance, the upper-limits
on non-Gaussianity from the WMAP CMB experiment correspond to roughly a 4%
shift in sigma_8 as measured from cluster counts and about 2% shift through
weak lensing. This is not enough to account for the current internal and mutual
discrepancies between the different methods, unless non-Gaussianity is strongly
scale dependent. A comparison between future X-ray surveys with a two fold
improvement in cluster mass calibration and future cosmic shear surveys with
400 deg^2 will be required to constrain non-Gaussianity on small scales with a
precision matching that of the current CMB constraints on larger scales. Our
results argue for the presence of systematics in the current cluster and cosmic
shear surveys, or to non-standard physics other than non-Gaussianity.

addition, there is a faint (V_555 ~ 23.8) star visible in archival HST F555W

its nucleus mass of $10^7$ $M_{\odot}$, the outer stellar envelope of the dwarf
is nearly completely stripped whereas the central nucleus can survive from the
tidal stripping because of its compactness. The developed naked nucleus has a
very bound retrograde orbit around the young Galactic disc, as observed for
$\omega$ Cen, with its apocenter and pericenter distances of $\sim$ 8 kpc and
$\sim$ 1 kpc, respectively. The Galactic tidal force can induce radial inflow
of gas to the dwarf's center and consequently triggers moderately strong
nuclear starbursts in a repetitive manner. This result implies that efficient
nuclear chemical enrichment resulting from the later starbursts can be closely
associated with the origin of the observed relatively young and metal-rich

such as intracluster stars (ICSs), GCs (ICGCs), and ``ultra-compact dwarf''

Fornax cluster of galaxies. We find that the outer stellar components of a
nucleated dwarf are removed by the strong tidal field of the cluster, whereas
the nucleus manages to survive as a result of its initially compact nature. The
developed naked nucleus is found to have physical properties (e.g., size and
mass) similar to those observed for UCDs. We also find that the UCD formation
processes does depend on the radial density profile of the dark halo in the
sense that UCDs are less likely to be formed from dwarfs embedded in dark
matter halos with central `cuspy' density profiles. Our simulations also
suggest that very massive and compact stellar systems can be rapidly and
efficiently formed in the central regions of dwarfs through the merging of
smaller GCs. GCs initially in the outer part of dE and dE,Ns are found to be
stripped to form ICGCs.

the existence of a significant convection zone in the stellar envelope of

provides information about properties of the stellar inner layers. It is shown
that the small separation can be affected by rotation at the level of 0.1-0.2
microHz for a 1.4 Mo model rotating with an equatorial velocity of 20 km/s at
the surface. This is of the same order of magnitude as the expected precision
on frequencies with a 3 months observation and must therefore be taken into

products of heavy particles. In particular we study under which circumstances
this decay may produce a significant reionization at high redshift ($z \simeq
20$), as requested by the WMAP result.Extra sources of reionization at high
redshifts increase the recombination rate. As a result, the number density of
decaying particles required to produce a high level of ionization at $z \simeq
10-20$ is significantly higher ($\simeq 300$ times) than previously estimated.
Moreover, the ionization produced by decay particles implies a high optical
depth even if the maximum level of ionization ever produced is of the order of
$10^{-2}$. In order to match the cosmic microwave background polarization power
spectrum, other significant sources of reionization are needed at low redshift.
Decaying particles producing a ionization fraction $x \simeq 0.5$ at $z \simeq
20$ would imply an optical depth much too high to fit the cosmic microwave
background spectra at $l \ge 30$. For decay times $t_{dec} < 2 \times 10^{16}
{\rm s}$, recent cosmic microwave background and large scale structure data
limits the primordial abundance of the decaying particles to $\Omega_x \le 21
\times 10^{-9} (1+z)^3$ at 95 % C.L., and favors long decay times. The data do
not favor this reionization model versus the instantaneous reionization one. We
also find that the decay of these heavy particles significantly heats up the
medium, bringing the expected $y$ distortion to unobservable levels.

contributions of particle pairs at short distances, which is intrinsically
related to the presence of an appreciable degree of disorder. The value of

results. In contrast, for a strong disorder a Gaussian-like distribution is
obtained. The average dipole coupling energy $\bar E_\mathrm{dip}$ decreases
with increasing structural disorder. The role of vacancies has been studied for
a square particle array by determining the angular distribution of the
preferred microvortex angle as function of the vacancy concentration.
Indications for a preferred angular direction along the axial as well as along
the diagonal directions of the square array are revealed. A corresponding
investigation for disturbed square arrays results in a different angular
distribution. The effect of dipole-quadrupole corrections resulting from the
finite size of the particles is quantified.

local-gauge symmetry in the broken-symmetry phase is implemented through the
associated Ward identities, which reduce the number of independent running
couplings to a single one. For this coupling the $\epsilon$-expansion can be
controlled to all orders in $\epsilon$ ($=3-d$). For spatial dimensions $1 < d
\leq 3$ the Bogoliubov fixed point is unstable towards a different fixed point
characterized by the divergence of the longitudinal correlation function. The
Bogoliubov linear spectrum, however, is found to be independent from the
critical behavior of this correlation function, being exactly constrained by
Ward identities. The new fixed point properly gives a finite value of the
coupling among transverse fluctuations, but due to virtual intermediate
longitudinal fluctuations the effective coupling affecting the transverse
correlation function flows to zero. As a result, no transverse anomalous
dimension is present. This treatment allows us to recover known results for the
quantum Bose gas in the context of a unifying framework and also to reveal the
non-trivial skeleton structure of its perturbation theory.

order parameters, it is shown that the model goes through a transition between
a vacuum with broken chiral symmetry, and a chirally restored phase at high
baryon chemical potential (mu) with a diquark condensate roughly proportional
to the area of the Fermi surface and a broken U(1) baryon number symmetry. The
condensation of diquark pairs from the fermionic spectrum is shown to lead to
an energy gap (Delta) about the Fermi energy (E_F), which is found to be
approximately 15% of the vacuum fermion mass and roughly independent of mu in
the chirally restored phase. The ground-state is believed, therefore, to be
that of a BCS superfluid. We also discuss the effect of simulating on a finite
volume, and any caveats this places on the conclusions made above.

problem of a light Higgs boson. In these ''little Higgs'' models, the Standard
Model Higgs boson is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of an approximate global
symmetry. The Higgs boson acquires mass radiatively only through ''collective
breaking'' of the global symmetry, so that more than one interaction is
required to give the Higgs a mass. This protects the Higgs mass from receiving
quadratically divergent radiative corrections at one-loop. These models contain
new vector bosons, fermions and scalars at the TeV scale that cancel the
quadratic divergences in the Higgs mass due to the Standard Model gauge, top
quark, and Higgs boson loops. In this talk I review the phenomenology of the
little Higgs models, focusing on collider signatures and electroweak precision

absolute error of 0.3 pN. In addition, the Casimir pressure between two
parallel plates was determined dynamically with an absolute error of $\approx
0.6$ mPa. Within the limits of experimental and theoretical errors, the results
are in agreement with a theory that takes into account the finite conductivity

approaches to the thermal Casimir force which predict effects linear in

duality, which states that strings on a plane-wave background are dual to a
particular large R-charge sector of N=4, D=4 superconformal U(N) gauge theory.
This duality is a specification of the usual AdS/CFT correspondence in the
""Penrose limit''. The Penrose limit of AdS_5 S^5 leads to the maximally
supersymmetric ten dimensional plane-wave (henceforth ""the'' plane-wave) and
corresponds to restricting to the large R-charge sector, the BMN sector, of the
dual superconformal field theory. After assembling the necessary background
knowledge, we state the duality and review some of its supporting evidence. We
review the suggestion by 't Hooft that Yang-Mills theories with gauge groups of
large rank might be dual to string theories and the realization of this
conjecture in the form of the AdS/CFT duality. We discuss plane-waves as exact
solutions of supergravity and their appearance as Penrose limits of other
backgrounds, then present an overview of string theory on the plane-wave
background, discussing the symmetries and spectrum. We then make precise the
statement of the proposed duality, classify the BMN operators, and mention some
extensions of the proposal. We move on to study the gauge theory side of the
duality, studying both quantum and non-planar corrections to correlation
functions of BMN operators, and their operator product expansion. The important
issue of operator mixing and the resultant need for re-diagonalization is
stressed. Finally, we study strings on the plane-wave via light-cone string
field theory, and demonstrate agreement on the one-loop correction to the
string mass spectrum and the corresponding quantity in the gauge theory. A new
presentation of the relevant superalgebra is given.

symmetries. The maximal analytic extension of ellipsoid type metrics are
constructed and the Penrose diagrams are analyzed with respect to adapted
frames. We prove that for small deformations (small eccentricities) there are
such metrics that the geodesic behaviour is similar to the Schwarzcshild one.
The new class of spacetimes do not possess Killing symmetries even in the
limits to the general relativity and, in consequence, they are not prohibited
by black hole uniqueness theorems. Such static ellipsoid (rotoid)
configurations are compatible with the cosmic cenzorship criteria. We study the
perturbations of two classes of static black ellipsoid solutions of four
dimensional gravitational field equations. We conclude that such anisotropic
black hole objects may be stable with respect to the perturbations parametrized
by the Schrodinger equations in the framework of the one--dimensional inverse
scattering theory.

  Instead we recast this problem as a question of finding integrals of motion

we use the identification of the cohomology of the Hilbert schemes with a Fock
space modelled on the lattice H(X). With this identification, Lehn computed the
operator of intersection with the boundary. It is essentially the
Calogero-Sutherland Hamiltonian.

Dunkl-Cherednik operators to find an explicit commuting family of differential
operators; these operators represent cup product on the Hilbert scheme.

ensemble mean and the ensemble standard deviation to the skill of a
site-specific probabilistic temperature forecast? Is it the case that most of
the benefit of using an ensemble forecast to predict temperatures comes from
the ensemble mean, or from the ensemble spread, or is the benefit derived
equally from the two? The answer is that one of the two is much more useful
than the other.

ensemble temperature forecasts depends on the apparently restrictive assumption
that the uncertainty around temperature forecasts is normally distributed. We
generalise the model using the kernel density to allow for much more flexible
distribution shapes. However, we do not find any meaningful improvement in the
resulting probabilistic forecast when evaluated using likelihood based scores.
We conclude that the distribution of uncertainty is either very close to
normal, or if it is not close to normal, then the non-normality is not being
predicted by the ensemble forecast that we test.

developed for the study of nuclear migration dynamics in cultured mammalian
cells. When cultured on 10-20 um wide adhesive stripes, the motility of C6
glioma and primary mouse fibroblast cells is diminished. Nevertheless, nuclei
perform an unexpected auto-reverse motion: when a migrating nucleus approaches
the leading edge, it decelerates, changes the direction of motion and
accelerates to move toward the other end of the elongated cell. During this
process cells show signs of polarization closely following the direction of
nuclear movement. The observed nuclear movement requires a functioning
microtubular system, as revealed by experiments disrupting the main
cytoskeletal components with specific drugs. On the basis of our results we
argue that auto-reverse nuclear migration is due to forces determined by the
interplay of microtubule dynamics and the changing position of the microtubule
organizing center as the nucleus reaches the leading edge. Our assay
recapitulates specific features of nuclear migration (cell polarization,
oscillatory nuclear movement), while allows the systematic study of a large
number of individual cells. In particular, our experiments yielded the first
direct evidence of reversive nuclear motion in mammalian cells, induced by
attachment constraints.

pointing out the existence of biphasic furrow contraction. The first phase is
characterized by a constant contraction rate, is better studied, and seems
universal to a large extent. The second phase is more diverse. In Dictyostelium
discoideum the transition involves a change in the rate of contraction, and
occurs when the width of the cleavage furrow is comparable to the height of the
cell. In Entamoeba invadens the contractile ring carries the cell through the
first phase, but cannot complete the second stage of cytokinesis. As a result,
a cooperative mechanism has evolved in that organism, where a neighboring
amoeba performs directed motion towards the dividing cell, and physically
causes separation by means of extending a pseudopod. We expand here on a
previous report of this novel chemotactic signaling mechanism.

describe dynamical wavefunction collapse toward energy eigenstates, for which
it is shown that wavefunction collapse of macroscopic objects does not work
properly. In one case, a common particle position measuring situation, the
apparatus evolves to a superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states
(does not collapse to one of them as it should) because each such
particle/apparatus/environment state has precisely the same energy spectrum.
Second, assuming an experiment takes place involving collapse to one of two
possible outcomes which is permanently recorded, it is shown in general that
this can only happen in the unlikely case that the two apparatus states
corresponding to the two outcomes have disjoint energy spectra. Next, the
progressive narrowing of the energy spectrum due to the collapse mechanism is
considered. This has the effect of broadening the time evolution of objects as
the universe evolves. Two examples, one involving a precessing spin, the other
involving creation of an excited state followed by its decay, are presented in
the form of paradoxes. In both examples, the microscopic behavior predicted by
standard quantum theory is significantly altered under energy-driven collapse,
but this alteration is not observed by an apparatus when it is included in the
quantum description. The resolution involves recognition that the statevector
describing the apparatus does not collapse, but evolves to a superposition of
macroscopically different states.

security of quantum cryptographic protocols. Our analysis employs two quite
different methods. The first method uses the concept of a reference system --
in a world subject to a superselection rule, unrestricted operations can be
simulated by parties who share access to a reference system with suitable
properties. By this method, we prove that if an n-party protocol is secure in a
world subject to a superselection rule, then the security is maintained even if
the superselection rule is relaxed. However, the proof applies only to a
limited class of superselection rules, those in which the superselection
sectors are labeled by unitary irreducible representations of a compact
symmetry group. The second method uses the concept of the format of a message
sent between parties -- by verifying the format, the recipient of a message can
check whether the message could have been sent by a party who performed
charge-conserving operations. By this method, we prove that protocols subject
to general superselection rules (including those pertaining to nonabelian
anyons in two dimensions) are no more secure than protocols in the unrestricted
world. However, the proof applies only to two-party protocols. Our results show
in particular that, if no assumptions are made about the computational power of
the cheater, then secure quantum bit commitment and strong quantum coin
flipping with arbitrarily small bias are impossible in a world subject to
superselection rules.

We present the results and analysis of our survey of HCN emission from 65
infrared galaxies including 9 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs,
Lir>10^{12}Lsun), 22 luminous infrared galaxies (LIGs,
10^{11}<Lir<~10^{12}Lsun) and 34 normal spiral galaxies with lower IR
luminosity (most are large spiral galaxies). We have measured the global HCN
line luminosity and the observations are reported in Gao and Solomon (2003,
Paper I). This paper analyzes the relationships between the total far-IR
luminosity a tracer of the star formation rate, the global HCN line luminosity
a measure of the total DENSE molecular gas content, and the CO luminosity a
measure of the total molecular content. We find a tight linear correlation
between the IR and HCN luminosities Lir and Lhcn (in the log-log plot) with a
correlation coefficient R=0.94. The IR--HCN linear correlation is valid over 3
orders of magnitude including ULIGs. The direct consequence of the linear
IR--HCN correlation is that the star formation law in terms of DENSE molecular
gas content has a power law index of 1.0. The global star formation rate is
linearly proportional to the mass of dense molecular gas in normal spiral
galaxies, LIGs, and ULIGs. This is strong evidence in favor of star formation
as the power source in ultraluminous galaxies since the star formation in these
galaxies appears to be normal and expected given their high mass of dense
star-forming molecular gas.

infrared (IR) and/or CO-bright and/or luminous galaxies, including seven
ultraluminous infrared galaxies, nearly 20 luminous infrared galaxies, and more
than a dozen of the nearest normal spiral galaxies. This is the largest and
most sensitive HCN survey of galaxies to date. All galaxies observed so far
follow the tight correlation between the IR luminosity $L_{\rm IR}$ and the HCN
luminosity $L_{\rm HCN}$ initially proposed by Solomon, Downes, & Radford,
which is detailed in a companion paper. We also address here the issue of HCN
excitation. There is no particularly strong correlation between $L_{\rm HCN}$
and the 12$\mu$m luminosity; in fact, of all the four \IRAS bands, the 12$\mu$m
luminosity has the weakest correlation with the HCN luminosity. There is also
no evidence of stronger HCN emission or a higher ratio of HCN and CO
luminosities $L_{\rm HCN}/L_{\rm CO}$ for galaxies with excess 12$\mu$m
emission. This result implies that mid-IR radiative pumping, or populating, of
the J=1 level of HCN by a mid-IR vibrational transition is not important
compared with the collisional excitation by dense molecular hydrogen.
Furthermore, large velocity gradient calculations justify the use of HCN J=1-0
emission as a tracer of high-density molecular gas ($\approxgt 3\times
10^4/\tau$ cm$^{-3}$) and give an estimate of the mass of dense molecular gas
from HCN observations. Therefore, $L_{\rm HCN}$ may be used as a measure of the
total mass of dense molecular gas, and the luminosity ratio $L_{\rm HCN}/L_{\rm
CO}$ may indicate the fraction of molecular gas that is dense.

  Ringberg, 11-15 July 2003",,,,"astro-ph",,"  I review the up-to-date status on the properties of the Dark Matter density
distribution around Galaxies. The rotation curves of spirals all conform to a
same Universal profile which can be uniquely decomposed as the sum of an
exponential thin stellar disk and a dark halo with a flat density core.
  From dwarfs to giants galaxies, the halos embedding the stellar component
feature a constant density region of size $r_0$ and value $\rho_0$, which are
inversely correlated. The fine structure of dark halos in the region of the
stellar disk has been derived for a number of low--luminosity disk galaxies:
the halo circular velocity increases almost linearly with radius out to the
edge of the stellar disk, implying, up there, an almost constant dark matter
density. This sets a serious discrepancy between the cuspy density distribution
predicted by N-body simulations of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and those actually
detected around galaxies. The small scatter around the Fundamental Plane (FP)
of elliptical galaxies constraints the distribution of dark and luminous matter
in these systems. The measured central velocity dispersion $\sigma_0$ in the FP
is linked to both photometric and dynamical properties of luminous and dark
matter. As a consequence, the well-known features of the FP imply that, inside
the effective radius $R_e$, the stellar spheroid must dominate over the dark
matter, in contrast with $\Lambda$CDM predictions.

parameter-by-parameter scaling of a multi-component fit to the solar irradiance
power spectrum (from VIRGO/PMO6 data), and scaling laws derived from ground
based observations of various stellar samples, is presented.
  We observe a correlation in the Sun between the amplitude of the power
spectrum on weeks timescales and the BBSO Ca II K-line index of chromospheric
activity. On the basis of this evidence, the chromospheric activity level,
predicted from rotation period and B-V colour estimates according to the
relationship first introduced by Noyes(1983) and Noyes et al. (1984), is used
to predict the variability power on weeks time scale. The rotation period is
estimated on the basis of a fit to the distribution of rotation period versus
$B-V$ observed in the Hyades and the Skumanich (1972) spin-down law. The
characteristic timescale of the variability is also scaled according to the
rotation period.
  We use this model to estimate the impact of the target star type and age on
the detection capability of missions such as Eddington and Kepler. K stars are
found to be the most promising targets, while the performance drops
significantly for stars earlier than G and younger than 2.0 Gyr. Simulations
also show that \emph{Eddington} should detect terrestrial planets orbiting
solar-age stars in most of the habitable zone for G2 types and all of it for K0
and K5 types.

origin is considered. It is shown that the presence of the oscillations causes
an important drop in the WMAP chi square of about fifteen. The F-test reveals
that such a drop has a probability less than 0.06% to occur by chance and can

characteristics of the star-forming episodes in these regions, including their
strength, maturity, spatial variability, and extinction. The HII regions stand
out from the nuclei. Unlike observations of nuclear regions, HII region
near-infrared observations do not show a spatial coincidence of the line and
continuum emission; the continuum and line maps of HII regions usually show
distinct and sometimes spatially-separated morphologies. Gauging from Paschen
beta and Brackett gamma equivalent widths and luminosities, the HII regions
have younger episodes of star formation than the nuclei and more intense
radiation fields. Near-infrared line ratio diagnostics suggest that HII regions
have ""purer"" starbursting properties. The correlation between ionizing photon
density and mid-infrared color is consistent with the star formation activity
level being higher for HII regions than for nuclei. And though the
interpretation is complicated, on a purely empirical basis the HII regions show
lower Fe1+ abundances than nuclei by an order of magnitude.

interpreted as due to polarization. First, we find that the number of
scattering events suitable for measuring polarization -- having been scattered
from one detector to another, with a count produced in both -- is considerably
lower than estimated by Coburn and Boggs (2003; CB03), by a factor of 10. The
signal-to-noise of the data-set is thus too low to produce a detection, even
from a 100% polarized source. Nonetheless, we develop a polarization-detection
analysis limited in sensitivity only by Poisson noise, which does not require a
space-craft mass model to detect polarization, as in CB03. We find no signal
which might be interpreted as due to polarization. Separately, we reproduce the
CB03 signal and show that it is not due to polarization. Rather, the CB03
signal is consistent with the previously-neglected systematic uncertainty in
the ``null lightcurve'' used for detection. Due to the low signal-to-noise
ratio of the RHESSI data, our Poisson noise-limited analysis results in an
upper limit consistent with 100%-polarization of the gamma-ray flux from GRB
021206. Thus, no observational constraint on the polarization of GRB 021206 can

with low column density. These may not even be associated with galaxies. The
high-z galaxy types which do show evidence for dust are all strongly star
forming. Hence, as seen locally, star formation and dust in the distant
universe are also strongly correlated. It is beyond debate that star formation
at z ~ 3 is dominated by dusty systems who emit most of their bolometric flux
in the rest-frame FIR. What is not clear is whether these systems are totally

allow us to compare star-formation measures derived from aperture-corrected Ha

the dust-corrected star-formation diagnostics, though the scatter is larger
than that from observational errors, with significant offsets from trends
expected according to simple star-formation history (SFH) models. Varying
metallicities and/or initial mass functions seem unable to explain the observed
discrepancies. We investigate the star-formation properties further by
modelling the observed spectroscopic and photometric properties of the galaxies
in our survey. Nearly half of the galaxies surveyed possess features that
appear incompatible with simple constant or smoothly declining SFHs, favouring
instead irregular or temporally-varying SFHs. We demonstrate how this can
reconcile the majority of our observations, and determine empirical corrections
to calculate intrinsic star formation rates from measures based on UV (or u')
observations alone. We discuss the broader implications of our finding that a
significant fraction of star-forming galaxies have complex SFHs, particularly

explanation for this observation is a counter-intuitive model in which stellar
rotation near the critical velocity causes enhanced mass loss along the
rotation axis. This results from the large temperature difference between pole
and equator in rapidly rotating stars. Eta Carinae must rotate in excess of 90
per cent of its critical velocity to account for the observed shape. The large
outburst may have been shaped in a similar way. Our observations provide strong
support for the existence of a theoretically predicted rotational instability,

the mass ratio of the IG dust to the total metal in the Universe, as $\chi\la
0.1$ for $10 {\rm \AA} \la a \la 0.1 \micron$ and $\chi\la 0.1(a/0.1
\micron)^{-1}$ for $0.1 \micron\la a\la1\micron$, where $a$ is a characteristic
grain size of the IG dust. This upper bound of $\chi\sim0.1$ suggests that the
dust-to-metal ratio in the IGM is smaller than the current Galactic value. The
corresponding allowed density of the IG dust increases from $\sim10^{-34}$ g
cm$^{-3}$ at $z=0$ to $\sim10^{-33}$ g cm$^{-3}$ at $z\sim1$, and keeps almost
the value toward higher redshift. This causes IG extinction of $\la 0.2$ mag at
the observer's $B$-band for $z\sim 1$ sources and that of $\la 1$ mag for
higher redshift sources. Furthermore, if $E(B-V)\sim 0.1$ mag at the observer's

of the IG dust is $\la 100$ \AA. The 2175 \AA absorption feature of small
graphite may be found as a local minimum at $z\sim2.5$ in a plot of the
observed $E(B-V)$ as a function of the source redshift. Finally, the IGM mean

multiple star formation in small turbulent molecular clouds. Our goal is to
determine the sensitivity of the properties of the resulting stars and brown
dwarfs to variations in the initial conditions imposed. In this paper we report
on the results obtained by applying two different initial turbulent velocity
fields. The slope of the turbulent power-law spectrum alpha is set to -3 in
half of the calculations and to -5 in the other half. We find that, whereas the
stellar mass function seems to only be weakly dependent on the value of alpha,
the sub-stellar mass function turns out to be more sensitive to the initial
slope of the velocity field. We argue that, since the role of turbulence is to
create substructure from which gravitational instabilities may grow, variations
in other initial conditions that also determine the fragmentation process are
likely to affect the shape of the sub-stellar mass function as well. The
absence of many planetary mass `free-floaters' in our simulations, especially
in the mass range 1-10 MJ, suggests that, if these objects are abundant, they
are likely to form by similar mechanisms to those thought to operate in
quiescent accretion discs, instead of via instabilities in gravitationally
unstable discs. Finally, we find that multiple and single stars share
comparable kinematical properties, both populations being able to attain
velocities in the range 1-10 km/s. From these values we draw the conclusion
that only low-mass star-forming regions such as Taurus-Auriga or Ophiuchus,
where the escape speed is low, might have suffered some depletion of its single
and binary stellar population.

an obvious choice for these applications. Here we analyse the effect that using
an L3CCD has on visibility parameter estimation (amplitude and triple product
phase), including situations where the L3CCD raw output is processed in an
attempt to reduce the effect of stochastic multiplication noise introduced by
the on-chip gain process. We establish that under most conditions, fringe

known water maser emission in K 3-35, and a new cluster of masers in IRAS
17347-3139. This low rate of detections is compatible with the short life-time
of water molecules in PNe (~100 yr). The water maser cluster at IRAS 17347-3139
are distributed on a ellipse of size ~ 0.2"" x 0.1"", spatially associated with
compact 1.3 cm continuum emission (simultaneously observed with the VLA). From
archive VLA continuum data at 4.9, 8.4, and 14.9 GHz, a spectral index alpha =
0.76 +- 0.03 is derived for this radio source, which is consistent with either
a partially optically thick ionized region or with an ionized wind. However,
the latter scenario can be ruled out on mass-loss considerations, thus
indicating that this source is probably a young PN. The spatial distribution
and the radial velocities of the water masers are suggestive of a rotating and
expanding maser ring, tracing the innermost regions of a torus formed at the
end of the AGB phase. Given that the 1.3 cm continuum emission peak is located
near one of the tips of the major axis of the ellipse of masers, we speculate
on a possible binary nature of IRAS 17347-3139, where the radio continuum
emission could belong to one of the components and the water masers would be
associated with a companion.

Telescope. The new results confirm our earlier findings, namely that IRAS
23385+6053 is a good candidate high-mass protostellar object, precursor of an
ultracompact H$_{II}$ region. The source is roughly composed of two regions: a
molecular core $\sim0.03\div0.04$ pc in size, with a temperature of $\sim40$ K
and an H$_{2}$ volume density of the order of 10$^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$, and an
extended halo of diameter $\leq$0.4 pc, with an average kinetic temperature of
$\sim 15$ K and H$_{2}$ volume density of the order of 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$. The
core temperature is much smaller than what is typically found in molecular
cores of the same diameter surrounding massive ZAMS stars. We deduce that the
core luminosity is between 150 and $1.6\times10^{4}L_{\odot}$, and we believe
that the upper limit is near the ``true'' source luminosity. Moreover, by
comparing the H$_{2}$ volume density obtained at different radii from the IRAS
source, we find that the halo has a density profile of the type $n_{\rm
H_{2}}\propto r^{-2.3}$. This suggests that the source is gravitationally
unstable. Finally, we demonstrate that the temperature at the core surface is
consistent with a core luminosity of $10^3 L_{\odot}$ and conclude that we
might be observing a protostar still accreting material from its parental
cloud, whose mass at present is $\sim 6 M_{\odot}$.

regions which span a large metallicity range, with oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H)
varying between 7.43 and 8.30 (Zsun/30<Z<Zsun/4). For a subsample of 7 HII
regions, we derive the He mass fraction taking into account known systematic
effects, including collisional and fluorescent enhancements of HeI emission
lines, collisional excitation of hydrogen emission, underlying stellar HeI
absorption and the difference between the temperatures Te(HeII) in the He^+
zone and Te(OIII) derived from the collisionally excited [OIII] lines. We find
that the net result of all the systematic effects combined is small, changing
the He mass fraction by less than 0.6%. By extrapolating the Y vs. O/H linear
regression to O/H=0 for 7 HII regions of this subsample, we obtain
Yp=0.2421+/-0.0021 and dY/dO=5.7+/-1.8, which corresponds to dY/dZ=3.7+/-1.2,
assuming the oxygen mass fraction to be O=0.66Z. In the framework of the
standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis theory, this Yp corresponds to Omega_b h^2 =
0.012^+0.003_-0.002, where h is the Hubble constant in units of 100 km/s/Mpc.
This is smaller at the 2sigma level than the value obtained from recent
deuterium abundance and microwave background radiation measurements. The linear
regression slope dY/dO=4.3+/-0.7 (corresponding to dY/dZ=2.8+/-0.5) for the
whole sample of 82 HII regions is similar to that derived for the subsample of
7 HII regions, although it has a considerably smaller uncertainty.

spin Hamiltonians, and investigate the extent to which frustration induced by
anisotropic exchanges can reduce the low temperature magnetization in these

model with low coordination number and purely ferromagnetic (FM) exchanges, we
find that the low temperature magnetization is gradually reduced as exchange
anisotropy is turned on. However, as the connectivity of the model is
increased, the effect of small-to-moderate anisotropy is suppressed, and the
magnetization regains its maximum saturation value at low temperatures unless
the distribution of exchanges is very wide. To obtain significant suppression
of the low temperature magnetization in a model with high connectivity, as is
found for long-range interactions, we find it necessary to have both
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchanges (e.g. as in the RKKY
interaction). This implies that disorder in the sign of the exchange
interaction is much more effective in suppressing magnetization at low

temperature, which has been observed earlier, is proposed. The point is that
the photon assisted pairing happens in a system of electrons and holes that
occupy energy levels at the very bottoms of the bands. Due to a very high e-h
density, the destruction of the pairs and loss of coherency does not occur
because almost all energy levels inside a 30-60 meV band from the bottom of the
conduction band prove to be occupied. As a result, a coherent ensemble of
composite bosons (paired electrons and holes) with the minimum possible energy
appears. The lifetime of this strongly non-equilibrium coherent e-h BCS-like
state is as short as a few hundred of femtoseconds

strong interactions and of magnetism -- are analogous in many ways. The
electroweak interactions of pions result from gauging an SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y
symmetry which then breaks to the U(1)_{em} gauge symmetry of electromagnetism.
The electromagnetic interactions of magnons arise from gauging not only
U(1)_{em} but also the SU(2)_s spin rotational symmetry, with the
electromagnetic fields E and B appearing as non-Abelian vector potentials.
Pions couple to electromagnetism through a Goldstone-Wilczek current that
represents the baryon number of Skyrmions and gives rise to the decay \pi^0 to
\gamma \gamma. Similarly, magnons may couple to an analogue of the
Goldstone-Wilczek current for baby-Skyrmions which induces a magnon-two-photon
vertex. The corresponding analogue of photon-axion conversion is photon-magnon
conversion in an external magnetic field. The baryon number violating decay of
Skyrmions can be catalyzed by a magnetic monopole via the Callan-Rubakov
effect. Similarly, baby-Skyrmion decay can be catalyzed by a charged wire. For
more than two flavors, the Wess-Zumino-Witten term enters the low-energy pion
theory with a quantized prefactor N_c -- the number of quark colors. The magnon
analogue of this prefactor is the anyon statistics angle \theta which need not

generalize all previous results in the literature. An important result here is
that the extra force in brane-world models with ${\bf Z}_{2}$-symmetry is
continuous and well defined across the brane. This is because the momentum
component along the extra dimension is discontinuous across the brane, which
effectively compensates the discontinuity of the extrinsic curvature. We show
that brane theory and STM produce identical interpretation of the bulk geodesic
motion. This holds for null and non-null bulk geodesics. Thus, experiments with
test particles are unable to distinguish whether our universe is described by
the brane world scenario or by STM. However, they do discriminate between the

of dynamical quark effects has been clarified by a comparison of quenched QCD

effects of $u$ and $d$ quarks are taken into account, but the third quark $s$
is still treated in a quenched approximation. As the final step towards a fully
realistic lattice simulation of QCD, two collaborations started a joint project
of three flavor QCD, concentrating all big computers available. Based on a
series of preparative studies of exact simulation algorithm and

equipped with Bragg gratings (BGs), which form an equilateral triangle. The
objective of the work is to investigate solitons and their stability in this
system. New results are also obtained for the earlier investigated dual-core
system. Families of symmetric and antisymmetric solutions are found
analytically, extending beyond the spectral gap in both the dual- and tri-core
systems. Moreover, these families persist in the case (strong coupling between
the cores) when there is no gap in the system's linear spectrum. Three
different types of asymmetric solitons are found in the tri-core system. They
exist only inside the spectral gap, but asymmetric solitons with nonvanishing
tails are found outside the gap as well. The symmetric solitons are stable up
to points at which two types of asymmetric solitons bifurcate from them. Beyond
the bifurcation, one type of the asymmetric solitons is stable, and the other
is not. Then, they swap their stability. In both the dual- and tri-core
systems, the stability region of the symmetric solitons extends far beyond the
gap, persisting in the case when the system has no gap at all. The whole
stability region of antisymmetric solitons is located outside the gap. Thus,
solitons in multi-core BGs can be observed experimentally in a much broader
frequency band than in the single-core one, and in a wider parameter range than
it could be expected.

also observe sideband noise resonances when the magnetic field produces an
atomic Larmor precession at a frequency corresponding to one half of the

fundamental units of nature: velocity of light $c$ and quantum of action $h$.
On the other hand, the poor precision of gravitational constant $G$, which is
widely believed to define the ``cube of theories'' and the units of the future
``theory of everything'', does not allow to use $G$ as a fundamental
dimensional constant in metrology. The electromagnetic units in SI are actually
based on concepts of prerelativistic classical electrodynamics such as ether,
electric permitivity and magnetic permeability of vacuum. Concluding remarks
are devoted to terminological confusion which accompanies the progress in basic

E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.69.041906",,"physics.bio-ph",,"  Relaxation channels for two-vibron bound states in an anharmonic alpha-helix
protein are studied. It is pointed out that the relaxation originates in the
interaction between the dressed anharmonic vibrons and the remaining phonons.
This interaction is responsible for the occurrence of transitions between
two-vibron eigenstates mediated by both phonon absorption and phonon emission.
At biological temperature, it is shown that the relaxation rate does not
significantly depends on the nature of the two-vibron state involved in the
process. Therefore, the lifetime for both bound and free states is of the same
order of magnitude and ranges between 0.1 and 1.0 ps for realistic parameters.
By contrast, the relaxation channels strongly depend on the nature of the
two-vibron states which is a consequence of the breather-like behavior of the
two-vibron bound states.

domains containing only two neutral species inside. These two neutral species
can protect each other from the external invaders (predators) and extend their

transition is equivalent to those found in spreading models with two equivalent

from a purely quantum-mechanical point of view. To overcome this drawback, a
new class of quantum trajectories is proposed. These trajectories, based on the
same grounds as Bohmian ones, are solely associated to the system reduced
density matrix, since the evolution of the environment degrees of freedom is
not considered explicitly. Within this approach, environment effects come into
play through a time-dependent damping factor that appears in the system
equations of motion. Apart from their evident computational advantage, this
type of trajectories also results very insightful to understand the system
decoherence. In particular, here we show the usefulness of these trajectories
analyzing decoherence effects in interference phenomena, taking as a working
model the well-known double-slit experiment.

them to produce a smaller number of more reliable pairs. If this is done with
only a forward classical side channel, the procedure is equivalent to using a
quantum error-correcting code (QECC). We instead investigate entanglement
purification protocols with two-way classical side channels (2-EPPs) for finite
block sizes. In particular, we consider the analog of the minimum distance
problem for QECCs, and show that 2-EPPs can exceed the quantum Hamming bound
and the quantum Singleton bound. We also show that 2-EPPs can achieve the rate
k/n = 1 - (t/n) \log_2 3 - h(t/n) - O(1/n) (asymptotically reaching the quantum
Hamming bound), where the EPP produces at least k good pairs out of n total
pairs with up to t arbitrary errors, and h(x) = -x \log_2 x - (1-x) \log_2
(1-x) is the usual binary entropy. In contrast, the best known lower bound on
the rate of QECCs is the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound k/n \geq 1 - (2t/n)
\log_2 3 - h(2t/n). Indeed, in some regimes, the known upper bound on the
asymptotic rate of good QECCs is strictly below our lower bound on the
achievable rate of 2-EPPs.

entropy of entanglement. We naturally obtain a monotonicity axiom for any
measure of quantum correlation of ensembles. We evaluate this measure for
certain cases. Subsequently we use this measure to propose a complementarity
relation between our measure and the accessible information obtainable about
the ensemble under local operations. The measure along with the monotonicity
axiom are well-defined even for the case of a single system, where the

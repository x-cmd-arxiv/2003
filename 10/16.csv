GRBs so far. It is currently localizing 25 - 30 GRBs per year, and has
localized 43 GRBs to date. Twenty-one of these localizations have led to the
detection of X-ray, optical, or radio afterglows, and as of now, 11 of the
bursts with afterglows have redshift determinations. HETE-2 has also observed
more than 45 bursts from soft gamma-ray repeaters, and more than 700 X-ray
bursts. HETE-2 has confirmed the connection between GRBs and Type Ic
supernovae, a singular achievement and certainly one of the scientific
highlights of the mission so far. It has provided evidence that the
isotropic-equivalent energies and luminosities of GRBs may be correlated with
redshift; such a correlation would imply that GRBs and their progenitors evolve
strongly with redshift. Both of these results have profound implications for
the nature of GRB progenitors and for the use of GRBs as a probe of cosmology
and the early universe. HETE-2 has placed severe constraints on any X-ray or
optical afterglow of a short GRB. It has made it possible to explore the
previously unknown behavior optical afterglows at very early times, and has
opened up the era of high-resolution spectroscopy of GRB optical afterglows. It
is also solving the mystery of ""optically dark"" GRBs, and revealing the nature
of X-ray flashes (XRFs).

dwarf nova system SS Cygni using RXTE data and AAVSO observations. A series of
pointed RXTE/PCA observations allow us to trace the evolution of the X-ray
spectrum of SS Cygni in unprecedented detail, while 6 years of optical AAVSO
and RXTE/ASM light curves show long-term patterns. Employing a technique in
which we stack the X-ray flux over multiple outbursts, phased according to the
optical light curve, we investigate the outburst morphology. We find that the
3-12 keV X-ray flux is suppressed during optical outbursts, a behavior seen
previously, but only in a handful of cycles. The several outbursts of SS Cygni
observed with the more sensitive RXTE/PCA also show a depression of the X-rays
during optical outburst. We quantify the time lags between the optical and
X-ray outbursts, and the timescales of the X-ray recovery from outburst. The
optical light curve of SS Cygni exhibits brief anomalous outbursts. During
these events the hard X-rays and optical flux increase together. The long-term
data suggest that the X-rays decline between outburst. Our results are in
general agreement with modified disk instability models (DIM), which invoke a
two-component accretion flow consisting of a cool optically thick accretion
disk truncated at an inner radius, and a quasi-spherical hot corona-like flow
extending to the surface of the white dwarf. We discuss our results in the
framework of one such model, involving the evaporation of the inner part of the
optically thick accretion disk, proposed by Meyer & Meyer-Hofmeister (1994).

with development of superhumps typical of a WZ Sge-type dwarf nova, exhibited a
series of six major rebrightenings. During these rebrightenings and the
following long fading tail, EG Cnc persistently showed superhumps having a
period equal to the superhump period observed during the main superoutburst.
The persistent superhumps had a constant superhump flux with respect to the
rebrightening phase. These findings suggest the superhumps observed during the
rebrightening stage and the fading tail are a ""remnant"" of usual superhumps,
and are not newly triggered by rebrightenings. By comparison with the 1977

propose an activity sequence of WZ Sge-type superoutbursts, in which the
current outburst of EG Cnc is placed between a single-rebrightening event and
distinct outbursts separated by a dip. The post-superoutburst behavior of WZ
Sge-type dwarf novae can be understood in the presence of considerable amount
of remnant matter behind the cooling front in the outer accretion disk, even
after the main superoutburst. We consider the premature quenching of the hot

the effects of varying the initial-mass function (IMF), the maximum progenitor

Observations of WDs in three open clusters, the Hyades, Pleiades, and Praesepe,

results suggest that a large portion of the white dwarf deficit may be
explained by the presence of WDs in unresolved binary systems. However, the

Fragments of asteroids, in the form of meteorites, include samples of the first
solid matter to form in our Solar System 4.5 mia years ago. Spectroscopic
studies of asteroids show that they, like the meteorites, range from very
primitive objects to highly evolved small Earth-like planets that
differentiated into core mantle and crust. The asteroid belt displays
systematic variations in abundance of asteroid types from the more evolved
types in the inner belt to the more primitive objects in the outer reaches of
the belt thus bridging the gap between the inner evolved apart of the Solar
System and the outer primitive part of the Solar System. High-speed collisions
between asteroids are gradually resulting in their break-up. The size
distribution of kilometer-sized asteroids implies that the presently
un-detected population of sub-kilometer asteroids far outnumber the known
larger objects. Sub-kilometer asteroids are expected to provide unique insight
into the evolution of the asteroid belt and to the meteorite-asteroid
connection. We propose a space mission to detect and characterize sub-kilometer
asteroids between Jupiter and Venus. The mission is named Bering after the
famous navigator and explorer Vitus Bering. A key feature of the mission is an
advanced payload package, providing full on board autonomy of both object
detection and tracking, which is required in order to study fast moving objects
in deep space. The autonomy has the added advantage of reducing the cost of
running the mission to a minimum, thus enabling science to focus on the main
objectives.

abundances of distant star-forming galaxies using the ratio EWR_{23} formed
from the equivalent widths of the [O II] 3727, [O III] 4959,5007 and Hbeta
nebular emission lines. This EWR_{23} approach essentially identical to the
widely-used R_{23} method of Pagel etal (1979). Using data from three
spectroscopic surveys of nearby galaxies, we conclude that the emission line
equivalent width ratios are a good substitute for emission line flux ratios in
galaxies with active star formation. The RMS dispersion between EWR_{23} and
the reddening-corrected R_{23} values is sigma(log R_{23})\leq0.08 dex. This
dispersion is comparable to the emission-line measurement uncertainties for
distant galaxies in many spectroscopic galaxy surveys, and is somewhat smaller
than the uncertainties of sigma(O/H)~0.15 dex inherent in strong-line
metallicity calibrations. Because equivalent width ratios are partially
insensitive to interstellar reddening effects, emission line equivalent width
ratios should be superior to flux ratios when reddening corrections are not
available. The EWR_{23} method presented here is likely to be most useful for
statistically estimating the mean metallicities for large samples of galaxies
to trace their chemical properties as a function of redshift or environment.
The approach developed here is used in a companion paper (Kobulnicky etal 2003)

to the variation in the observer viewing angle. We test how various models
reproduce the jet data of Bloom, Frail, & Kulkarni (2003), which show a
negative correlation between the isotropic energy output and the inferred jet
opening angle (in a uniform jet configuration). We find, consistent with
previous studies, that a power-law structure for the jet energy as a function
of angle gives a good description. However, a Gaussian jet structure can also
reproduce the data well, particularly if the parameters of the Gaussian are
allowed some scatter. We place limits on the scatter of the parameters in both
the Gaussian and power-law models needed to reproduce the data, and discuss how
future observations will better distinguish between these models for the GRB
jet structure. In particular, the Gaussian model predicts a turnover at small
opening angles and in some cases a sharp cutoff at large angles, the former of
which may already have been observed. We also discuss the predictions each
model makes for the observed luminosity function of GRBs and compare these

(~11%) have logN_FeII > 15.2. High FeII column densities are observed in the
z=2.72 Lyman break galaxy cB58 (logN_FeII ~ 15.25) and in gamma-ray burst host
galaxies (logN_FeII ~ 14.8-15.9). Given our measured FeII column density and
assuming a moderate iron dust depletion (delta_Fe ~ 1 dex), we derive an
optical dust extinction A_V ~ 0.6. If the HI column density is log N(HI)<21.7
(as in 98% of DLAs), then the mean metallicity is Z/Z_sun > 0.2. The high
completeness of the GDDS sample implies that these results are typical of
star-forming galaxies in the 1<z<2 redshift range, an epoch which has
heretofore been particularly challenging for observational programs.

relations of spiral galaxies, the luminosity-rotation speed (or Tully-Fisher;
TF) relation, and the size-luminosity (SL) relation, and the dependences of
their scatter, at red and IR bands. We verify that the observed virial
relations of disk galaxies are given by Vobs \prop L^0.31 and Rd \prop L^0.33
using distance-redshift surveys of high surface brightness (HSB) and low
surface brightness (LSB) non-interacting galaxies. Thus the galaxy surface
brightness (SB) is Sigma \prop Rd \prop Vobs \prop Mvir^0.33. We derive the
first extensive J-band TF and SL relations using 2MASS data products. The TF
residuals are fully independent of SB and other tested observables. TF
relations (TFRs) for various morphological types have different zero points,
but a common slope, such that early-type (redder) disks rotate faster than
later-types (bluer) of the same luminosity. This dependence of the TFR is a
direct consequence of the more fundamental dependence on color, which itself is
related to the galaxy star formation history. The SL relation scatter is mostly
dominated by SB, but color also plays a small role. The TF and SL residuals for
HSB and LSB galaxies are weakly correlated, in agreement with the earlier claim
by Courteau & Rix (1999). This suggests that spiral disks of all color,
brightness, and barredness are, on average, dominated by dark matter even in
their inner parts. The observed scaling relations of disk galaxies are likely
the result of the simplest scenario of galaxy formation, but their color
dependence remains a challenge to hierarchical structure formation models. The
scaling relations and their derivatives are contrasted against galaxy formation
models in our companion paper.

comprising only 1% of the stellar halo mass, and being among the oldest stars
in our Galaxy. New spectra are presented of Galactic stars and integrated
spectra of Galactic globular clusters which extend to 3250 angstroms. These

globular clusters show strong NH3360 absorption, even though their spectral
energy distributions in the near-UV are dominated by blue horizontal branch,

from the central black hole, SgrA*, in its quiescent and flaring states. We
correct the fluxes observed by the Chandra and XMM telescopes for absorption
and scattering, using realistic models for the dust grain size distribution,
gas and dust abundances and spatial distributions. However, there are still
large uncertainties. Since much of the intervening dust is close to SgrA*, the
scattered halo of X-ray photons is very concentrated: its intensity can
dominate the Chandra PSF inside 1"", and so affects estimates of the point
source flux. It also broadens the radial intensity profiles of Galactic center
sources - observations of this effect can help constrain models of the spatial
distribution of the dust. We estimate that the combined scattering halos from
observed Galactic center sources within 10"" of SgrA* contribute up to ~10% of
the observed diffuse emission in this region. Dust-scattered photons suffer a
time delay relative to the photons that arrive directly. For dust that is 100
pc towards us from the Galactic center, this delay is about 1000 s at angles of
1"", and 100 ks at 10"". We illustrate how the evolution of the scattering halo
following X-ray flares from SgrA* or other sources can also help to constrain
the dust's line of sight distribution. We discuss the implications of X-ray
scattering halos for the intensity of diffuse emission that has been reported
within a few arcseconds of SgrA*: in the most extreme, yet viable, model we
consider, ~1/3 of it is due to dust scattering of an unresolved source. The
remainder results from an extended source of emission.

chemically pristine gas was reionized by ultraviolet photons emitted from the
first stars, but also enriched with heavy elements when these stars ended their
lives as energetic supernovae. Using the results from previous high-resolution
cosmological simulations of early structure formation that include radiative
transfer, we show that a significant volume fraction of the IGM can be
metal-polluted, as well as ionized, by massive Population III stars formed in
small-mass (10^6-10^7 Msun) halos early on. If most of the early generation
stars die as pair-instability supernovae with energies up to 10^{53} ergs, the
volume-averaged mean metallicity will quickly reach Z ~ 10^{-4}Zsun by a
redshift of 15-20, possibly causing a prompt transition to the formation of a
stellar population that is dominated by low-mass stars. In this scenario, the
early chemical enrichment history should closely trace the reionization history
of the IGM, and the end of the Population III era is marked by the completion
of reionization and pre-enrichment by z=15. We conclude that, while the
pre-enrichment may partially account for the ``metallicity-floor'' in
high-redshift Lyman-alpha clouds, it does not significantly affect the
elemental abundance in the intracluster medium.

destruction and recycling are ubiquitous, important in cluster formation and
evolution, and continue to mold clusters at the present epoch. Many ghosts
appear in X-ray bright clusters, perhaps signaling a connection with energetic
subcluster mergers. The fate of such material has important ramifications for
cluster evolution. Our new HST WFPC2 V & I images of a portion of the Centaurus

fitting the observed 2MASS IR photometry with accurately calibrated synthetic
photometry. Special care has been put in evaluating all sources of possible
errors and incorporating them in the analysis. A comparison of our temperature
determinations with spectroscopic temperatures published by different groups
reveals the presence of no systematic trends and a scatter compatible with the
quoted uncertainties of 0.5-1.3%. This mutual agreement strengthens the results
of both the spectroscopic and IR photometry analyses. Comparisons with other

also presented. In addition, the method employed of fitting IR photometry
naturally yields determinations of the stellar semi-angular diameters, which,

lens so far. If both the source and lens lie in the M31 disk, then the standard

is directed away from the centre of the galaxy, a finding which is in contrast
to the majority of galaxies studied to date. The oval distortion caused by the
interaction generates a sudden jump of the magnetic field pattern upstream of
the inner northern spiral arm, similar to galaxies with long bars. An unusual
``island'' of strong regular magnetic field east of the galaxy is probably the
brightest part of a magnetic arm frequently seen in spiral galaxies, which
appear to be phase-shifted images of the preceding optical arm. The strong
magnetic field of the ``island'' indicates a past phase of active star

evolution code with a general relativistic code that describes the behavior of
the neutron star. We assume the neutron star to be low--magnetized (B~10^8 G).
In the systems investigated in this paper, our computations show that during
the binary evolution the companion transfers as much as 1 solar mass to the
neutron star, with an accretion rate of 10^-9 solar masses/yr. This is
sufficient to keep the inner rim of the accretion disc in contact with the
neutron star surface, thus preventing the onset of a propeller phase capable of
ejecting a significant fraction of the matter transferred by the companion. We
find that, for neutron stars governed by equations of state from soft up to
moderately stiff, an accretion induced collapse to a black hole is almost
unavoidable. The collapse to a black hole can occur either during the accretion
phase or after the end of the mass transfer when the neutron star is left in a
supramassive sequence. In this last case the collapse is driven by energy
losses of the fast spinning radio pulsar. For extremely supramassive neutron
stars these energy losses cause a spin up. As a consequence the pulsar will
have a much shorter lifetime than that of a canonical radio pulsar. This
behavior depends on the equation of state for ultra-dense matter and therefore
could be used to constrain the internal structure of the neutron star. If the
r-modes of the neutron star are excited during the accretion process, the
gravitational waves emisson limits the maximum spin attainable by a NS to
roughly 2 ms. In this case the collapse during the accretion phase is even more
common since the maximum mass achievable before the collapse to a black hole
during accretion is smaller due to the limited spin frequency.

transition at 32.8 K in zero magnetic field. Such a field-induced dielectric

generated by either the Rashba or the Dresselhaus coupling. The spin Hall
conductance is independent of the stength of the coupling, but its sign is
determined by the relative ratio of the two couplings. The direction of spin
current is controllable by tuning the magnitude of the surface electric field
perpendicular to the two dimensional plane via adjusting the Rashba coupling.
It is observed that the spin Hall conductance has a close relation to the Berry
phase of conduction electrons.

intriguing behavior raised its head off and on until it regained its central
role in the mainstream physical sciences about a decade ago with a breakdown
and/or avalanche type (also called self-organized critical) behavior of the
sand-pile model and a host of other similar problems. In this communication, we
report on the non-equilibrium dynamics in our Random Resistor cum

semi-quantum percolative model has been highly successful in explaining the
static behavior for various random composite systems. In our dynamic studies
for the last several years, we observe two initial power-laws (more than a
decade each) and then an exponential relaxation for asymptotically large time

theoretical wisdom/s (which give, only one power-law relaxation for each such
system near its breakdown or run-away type state). Obviously, our results (with
two different power-laws) are richer than those particular cases. Further, a
complete theory is still lacking probably due to a much deeper issue of entropy

athermal) for such systems near their brinks (catastrophic failure not

queries return the K closest answers according to given distance metric in the
database with respect to Q. In this scenario, it is possible that a majority of
the answers may be very similar to some other, especially when the data has
clusters. For a variety of applications, such homogeneous result sets may not
add value to the user. In this paper, we consider the problem of providing
diversity in the results of KNN queries, that is, to produce the closest result
set such that each answer is sufficiently different from the rest. We first
propose a user-tunable definition of diversity, and then present an algorithm,
called MOTLEY, for producing a diverse result set as per this definition.
Through a detailed experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data, we show
that MOTLEY can produce diverse result sets by reading only a small fraction of
the tuples in the database. Further, it imposes no additional overhead on the
evaluation of traditional KNN queries, thereby providing a seamless interface
between diversity and distance.

a large number of small, noncontiguous pieces of data. If an application's I/O
needs are met by making many small, distinct I/O requests, however, the I/O
performance degrades drastically. To avoid this problem, MPI-IO allows users to
access noncontiguous data with a single I/O function call, unlike in Unix I/O.
In this paper, we explain how critical this feature of MPI-IO is for high
performance and how it enables implementations to perform optimizations. We
first provide a classification of the different ways of expressing an
application's I/O needs in MPI-IO--we classify them into four levels, called
level~0 through level~3. We demonstrate that, for applications with
noncontiguous access patterns, the I/O performance improves dramatically if
users write their applications to make level-3 requests (noncontiguous,
collective) rather than level-0 requests (Unix style). We then describe how our
MPI-IO implementation, ROMIO, delivers high performance for noncontiguous
requests. We explain in detail the two key optimizations ROMIO performs: data
sieving for noncontiguous requests from one process and collective I/O for
noncontiguous requests from multiple processes. We describe how we have
implemented these optimizations portably on multiple machines and file systems,
controlled their memory requirements, and also achieved high performance. We
demonstrate the performance and portability with performance results for three
applications--an astrophysics-application template (DIST3D), the NAS BTIO
benchmark, and an unstructured code (UNSTRUC)--on five different parallel
machines: HP Exemplar, IBM SP, Intel Paragon, NEC SX-4, and SGI Origin2000.

maximum number of segments that can be intersected by any one (axis-parallel)

triangulations of minimum stabbing number for a given set of points. The
complexity of these problems has been a long-standing open question; in fact,
it is one of the original 30 outstanding open problems in computational
geometry on the list by Demaine, Mitchell, and O'Rourke. The answer we provide
is negative for a number of minimum stabbing problems by showing them NP-hard
by means of a general proof technique. It implies non-trivial lower bounds on
the approximability. On the positive side we propose a cut-based integer
programming formulation for minimizing the stabbing number of matchings and
spanning trees. We obtain lower bounds (in polynomial time) from the
corresponding linear programming relaxations, and show that an optimal
fractional solution always contains an edge of at least constant weight. This
result constitutes a crucial step towards a constant-factor approximation via
an iterated rounding scheme. In computational experiments we demonstrate that
our approach allows for actually solving problems with up to several hundred

fields, corresponding to flat directions of supersymmetry, lifted by
supergravity corrections. Using a hybrid-type potential we obtain a two-stage
inflationary model. Depending on the curvature of the potential the first stage
corresponds to a period of fast-roll inflation or a period of `locked'
inflation, induced by an oscillating inflaton. This is followed by a second
stage of fast-roll inflation. We demonstrate that these two consecutive
inflationary phases result in enough total e-foldings to encompass the
cosmological scales. Using natural values for the parameters (masses of order
TeV and vacuum energy of the intermediate scale corresponding to gravity
mediated supersymmetry breaking) we conclude that the $\eta$-problem of
inflation is easily overcome. The greatest obstacle to our scenario is the
possibility of copious production of cosmologically disastrous primordial black
holes due to the phase transition switching from the first into the second
stage of inflation. We study this problem in detail and show analytically that
there is ample parameter space where these black holes do not form at all. To
generate structure in the Universe we assume the presence of a curvaton field.

considerations.

invariance violation in NC field theory were pointed out in \cite{har}. Out of
the two - Observer and Particle - distinct types of Lorentz transformations,
symmetry under the former, (due to the translation invariance), is reflected in
the conservation of energy and momentum in NC theory. The constant tensor
$\theta_{\mu\nu}$ (the noncommutativity parameter) destroys invariance under
the latter.
  In this paper we have constructed the Hamiltonian and momentum operators
which are the generators of time and space translations respectively. This is
related to the Observer Lorentz invariance. We have also shown that the
Schwinger condition and subsequently the Poincare algebra is not obeyed and
that one can not derive a Lorentz covariant dynamical field equation. These

resembles gauge transformations for matter fields. This may be done for general

is also shown that non-associative algebras naturally appear in this formalism,
which are briefly discussed.
  Afterwards, a general connection which includes a two-form field is
settled-down, solving the problem of setting a gauge theory for the Kalb-Ramond
field for generical groups.
  Topological Chern-Simons theories can also be defined in four dimensions, and
this approach clarifies their relation to the so-called $B \wedge F$-theories.
We also revise some standard aspects of Kalb-Ramond theories in view of these
new perspectives.
  Since this gauge connection is built upon a pair of fields consisting of a
one-form and a two-form, one may define Yang-Mills theories as usually and,
remarkably, also {\it minimal coupling} with bosonic matter, where the
Kalb-Ramond field appears naturally as mediator; so, a new associated conserved
charge can be defined. For the Abelian case, we explicitly construct the
minimal interaction between $B$-field and matter following a ""gauge principle""
and find a novel conserved tensor current. This is our most significative
result from the physical viewpoint.
  This framework is also generalized in such a way that any $p$-rank tensor may
be formulated as a gauge field.

continues in this spirit, we however propose here a basic framework to which
all of these inequalities belong, and a general unifying principle from which
many of them follow. This basic inequality relates the relative total energy --
internal, potential and interactive -- of two arbitrary probability densities,
their Wasserstein distance, their barycentres and their entropy production
functional. The framework is remarkably encompassing as it implies many old
geometric -- Gaussian and Euclidean -- inequalities as well as new ones, while
allowing a direct and unified way for computing best constants and extremals.
As expected, such inequalities also lead to exponential rates of convergence to
equilibria for solutions of Fokker-Planck and McKean-Vlasov type equations. The
principle also leads to a remarkable correspondence between ground state
solutions of certain quasilinear -- or semilinear -- equations and stationary
solutions of -- nonlinear -- Fokker-Planck type equations.

In

detailed account of one way around this problem, which is to extend equivariant
ordinary homology to a theory graded on representations of fundamental
groupoids. Versions of this theory have appeared previously for actions of
finite groups, but this is the first account that works for all compact Lie
groups.
  The first part of this work is a detailed discussion of RO(G)-graded ordinary
homology and cohomology, collecting scattered results and filling in gaps in
the literature. In particular, we give details on change of groups and products
that do not seem to have appeared elsewhere. We also discuss the relationship
between ordinary homology and cohomology when the group is compact Lie, in
which case the two theories are not represented by the same spectrum. The
remainder of the work discusses the extension to grading on representations of
fundamental groupoids, concentrating on those aspects that are not simple
generalizations of the RO(G)-graded case. These theories can be viewed as
defined on parametrized spaces, and then the representing objects are
parametrized spectra; we use heavily foundational work of May and Sigurdsson on
parametrized spectra. We end with a discussion of Poincare duality for
arbitrary smooth equivariant manifolds.

collapse-driven supernovae, which is derived by relativistic nuclear many body
theory. Recently the relativistic EOS table has become available as a new
complete set of physical EOS for numerical simulations of supernova explosion.
We examine this EOS table by using general relativistic hydrodynamics of the
gravitational collapse and bounce of supernova cores. In order to study dense
matter in dynamical situation, we perform simplified calculations of core
collapse and bounce by following adiabatic collapse with the fixed electron
fraction for a series of progenitor models. This is intended to give us
``approximate models'' of prompt explosion. We investigate the profiles of
thermodynamical quantities and the compositions during collapse and bounce. We
also perform the calculations with the Lattimer-Swesty EOS to compare the
properties of dense matter. As a measure of the stiffness of the EOS, we
examine the explosion energy of the prompt explosion with electron capture
totally suppressed. We study the derivative of the thermodynamical quantities
obtained by the relativistic EOS to discuss the convective condition in
neutron-rich environment, which may be important in the delayed explosion.

  between immiscible fluids","To appear in Physics of Fluids",,"10.1063/1.1630800",,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  The linearized Navier-Stokes equations for a system of superposed immiscible
compressible ideal fluids are analyzed. The results of the analysis reconcile
the stabilizing and destabilizing effects of compressibility reported in the
literature. It is shown that the growth rate $n$ obtained for an inviscid,
compressible flow in an infinite domain is bounded by the growth rates obtained
for the corresponding incompressible flows with uniform and exponentially
varying density. As the equilibrium pressure at the interface $p_\infty$
increases (less compressible flow), $n$ increases towards the uniform density
result, while as the ratio of specific heats $\gamma$ increases (less
compressible fluid), $n$ decreases towards the exponentially varying density
incompressible flow result. This remains valid in the presence of surface
tension or for viscous fluids and the validity of the results is also discussed
for finite size domains. The critical wavenumber imposed by the presence of
surface tension is unaffected by compressibility. However, the results show
that the surface tension modifies the sensitivity of the growth rate to a
differential change in $\gamma$ for the lower and upper fluids. For the viscous
case, the linearized equations are solved numerically for different values of
$p_\infty$ and $\gamma$. It is found that the largest differences compared with
the incompressible cases are obtained at small Atwood numbers. The most
unstable mode for the compressible case is also bounded by the most unstable
modes corresponding to the two limiting incompressible cases.

phenomenon termed original antigenic sin. A physical theory of protein
evolution to explain limitations in the immune system response to vaccination

from localization of the immune system response in antibody sequence space.
This localization is a result of the roughness in sequence space of the evolved
antibody affinity constant for antigen and is observed for diseases with high
year-to-year mutation rates, such as influenza.

  matters","11 pages, 3 figures",,,,"q-bio.BM",,"  We analyze the dependence of thermal denaturation transition and folding
rates of globular proteins on the number of amino acid residues, N. Using
lattice Go models we show that DeltaT/T_F ~ N^-1, where T_F is the folding
transition temperature and DeltaT is the folding transition width. This finding
is consistent with finite size effects expected for the systems undergoing a
phase transition from a disordered to an ordered phase. The dependence of the
folding rates k_F on N for lattice models and the dataset of 57 proteins and
peptides shows that k_F = k_F^0 exp(-CN^beta) provides a good fit, if 0 < beta
<= 2/3 and C is a constant. We find that k_F = k_F^0 exp(-1.1N^0.5) with k_F^0
=(0.4x10^-6 s)^-1 can estimate optimal protein folding rates to within an order
of magnitude in most cases. By using this fit for a set of proteins with
beta-sheet topology we find that k_F^0 is approximately equal to k_U^0, the
prefactor for unfolding rates. The maximum ratio of k_U^0/k_F^0 is 10 for this
class of proteins.

  We find that a significant fraction of our model galaxy disks have a higher

diagnostic diagrams involving prominent near-IR line ratios that allow us to
constrain the electronic density, temperature, and Fe gas phase abundance
ratio, independently of the heating process. Comparison with recent near-IR
observations of a sample of HH objects indicates gas phase Fe abundances
ranging from 15-50 % up to 100 % of the solar value in agreement with the
moderate depletions previously derived from optical line ratios or shock
models. Hence, it appears that Fe-bearing dust is efficiently destroyed in
stellar jets. We then use our Fe+ emissivity model to predict near-IR [Fe II]
emission maps for self-similar, cold MHD disk wind models. We show that
observations in [Fe II] with AMBER on the VLTI could severely constrain the MHD
solution and the inner launch radius of the jet. We also compare theoretical
predictions with recent observations in the near-IR [Fe II] lines of the
L1551-IRS5 and DG Tau jets. The cold disk wind model reproduces quite well the
two velocity components observed at -100 and -300 km/s, although the high
velocity component appears overestimated by a factor of 1.5 in the DG Tau jet.
However, the model predicts too little emission at intermediate-velocity and
insufficient densities. Denser disk winds with stronger heating at the jet
base, which have been invoked for optical jets, also appear needed in younger,

moving ejecta clumps can affect the outer shock structure of older remnants
such as Vela. Young remnants typically show a circular structure, but often

recorded at high signal-to-noise ratios with the UVES echelle spectrograph on
the ESO VLT. The line equivalent widths were analysed with the 1D, LTE, MARCS
model atmosphere code to deduce C and O abundances; corrections due to non-LTE
and 3D effects are discussed. When combined with similar published data for
disk stars, our results confirm the metallicity dependence of the C/O ratio
known from previous stellar and interstellar studies: C/O drops by a factor of
3-4 as O/H decreases from solar to 1/10 solar. Analysed within the context of
standard models for the chemical evolution of the solar vicinity, this drop
results from the metallicity dependence of the C yields from massive stars with
mass loss, augmented by the delayed release of C from stars of low and
intermediate mass. The former is, however, always the dominant factor. Our
survey has also uncovered tentative evidence to suggest that, as the oxygen
abundance decreases below [O/H] = -1, [C/O] may not remain constant at [C/O] =
-0.5, as previously thought, but increase again, possibly approaching
near-solar values at the lowest metallicities ([O/H] approximately equal to
-3). With the current dataset this is no more than a 3 sigma effect and it may
be due to metallicity-dependent non-LTE corrections to the [C/O] ratio which
have not been taken into account. However, its potential importance as a window
on the nucleosynthesis by Population III stars is a strong incentive for future
work, both observational and theoretical, to verify its reality.

decay channels in which most of the decay energy ionizes and heats the IGM gas
(and thus affects the CMB), and those in which most of the energy is carried
away -- e.g. photons with energies 100 keV < E < 1 TeV -- and thus appears as a
contribution to diffuse x-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds. The new constraints to
the decay-particle parameters from the CMB power spectrum thus complement those
from the cosmic X-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds. Although decaying particles
can indeed produce an optical depth consistent with that reported by WMAP, in
so doing they produce new fluctuations in the CMB temperature/polarization
power spectra. For decay lifetimes less than the age of the Universe, the
induced power spectra generally violate current constraints, while the power
spectra are usually consistent if the lifetime is longer than the age of the

thick (~7mm) masks required for high energy imaging. Simulation results from a
preliminary design study are reported which quantify the improvement in
off-axis imaging sensitivity vs. the conventional case with mask holes all

by continuously scanning the field of view of the telescope over the source

allowing event-based corrections for incomplete charge collection. Background
rejection is also improved by allowing low energy events from the rear and
sides of the detector to be rejected. We present experimental results of
interaction depth sensing in a 5 mm thick pixellated Au-contact IMARAD CZT
detector. The depth sensing was done by making simultaneous measurements of
cathode and anode signals, where the interaction depth at a given energy is
proportional to the ratio of cathode/anode signals. We demonstrate how a simple
empirical formula describing the event distributions in the cathode/anode
signal space can dramatically improve the energy resolution. We also estimate
the energy and depth resolution of the detector as a function of the energy and
the interaction depth. We also show a depth-sensing prototype system currently
under development for EXIST in which cathode signals from 8, 16 or 32 crystals
can be read-out by a small multi-channel ASIC board that is vertically
edge-mounted on the cathode electrode along every second CZT crystal boundary.
This allows CZT crystals to be tiled contiguously with minimum impact on
throughput of incoming photons. The robust packaging is crucial in EXIST, which
will employ very large area imaging CZT detector arrays.

candidates. More importantly, some new common observational characteristics
have been identified, such as the IR variability, the IR flattening in the
broad band energy spectrum, the X-ray spectral variability as a function of
pulse phase (which are not predicted by the magnetar model), and the SGR-like
bursts (which can not be explained in terms of standard accretion models). We
present the results obtained from an extensive multi-wavelength observational

bands, and XMM, Chandra (plus BeppoSAX archival data) in the X-rays. Based on

implemented the methods of these papers in our code and show that this
preference for rapid field decay is caused by the assumption that the beaming
fraction does not depend on the period. When we do include this dependence, we
find that the observed pulsar properties are reproduced best when the modelled
field does not decay.
  When we assume that magnetic fields of new-born neutron stars are from a
distribution sufficiently wide to explain magnetars, the magnetic field and
period distributions we predict for radio are pulsars wider than observed.
Finally we find that the observed velocities overestimate the intrinsic

the viewing geometry, in an inclined and rotating dipole magnetic field, we
show that at any given pulse phase observer can receive the radiation only from
the specific altitudes. We find the outer conal emission is received from the
higher altitudes than the inner conal components including the core. At any
pulse phase, low frequency emission comes from the higher altitudes than the
high frequency emission. As an application of our model, we have applied it to
explain the emission heights of conal components in PSR B0329+54.

double-mode (RRd) variables (V13, V200, and V251) in M3. Of the newly
discovered RRd's V13 is unusual in that it has the fundamental as the dominant
pulsation mode. Two of the new candidate RRd's (V13 and V200) have period
ratios as low as 0.738-0.739. They lie separated from all previously known
RRd's in the Petersen diagram, in positions implying a large spread in mass
and/or, less likely, in heavy element mass fraction, among the M3 horizontal
branch (HB) stars. We explore mass transfer and helium enhancement as possible
explanations for the apparent spread in HB masses. We also note that the masses
derived from the RRd analyses now favor little mass loss on the red giant
branch. V200 has changed its dominant pulsation mode from fundamental to first
overtone, while V251 has changed its dominant mode from first overtone to
fundamental in the interval 1992 to 1993. Together with M3-V166 this is the
first time that RRd variables are observed to switch their dominant pulsation
modes while remaining RRd's. The phenomenon is found to occur in a one year
time-span thus suggesting that these stars are undergoing a rapid evolutionary
phase, and that both redward and blueward evolution may take place among the HB
stars in M3. The unusual behavior of the M3 RRd's is discussed and compared to
that of the RRd's identified so far in globular clusters and in the field of

the cluster cores merge (Lx increases and Tx decreases). At both luminosity
peaks, clusters tend to appear spherical and relaxed, which may lead to biases

detectable Halpha emission; c) analogues near other galaxies should exist; and
d) many faint HVCs in the region around M31 can be found. Low metallicities are
indeed found in several HVCs, although they are also expected in several other
models. Halpha emission detected in most HVCs and, when examined more closely,
distant (D>200 kpc) HVCs should be almost fully ionized, implying that most
HVCs with HI must lie near the Milky Way. No clear extragalactic analogues have

critical angle separating quasars and radio galaxies is derived. The mean jet
speeds of classical double radio sources are estimated using the asymmetry of
jet-counterjet flux densities taken from the 3CRR and B2 samples. For FRI radio

exponentially with cosmic time due to adiabatic expansion, and a second phase
of high-density, high-temperature gas in virialized dark matter halos which
cools much more slowly by atomic processes. The mass fraction of gas in halos
converges to ~40% at late times, about twice its calculated value at the

dramatic effects on the electronic properties of Na$_x$CoO$_2$ in the full
doping range. It can significantly reduce the effective mobility of the charge
carriers, leading to a low degeneracy temperature $\epsilon_F \lesssim T$. Such
strongly renormalized Fermi liquid has rather unusual properties--from the
point of view of the ordinary metals with $\epsilon_F \gg T$--but similar to
the properties that are actually observed in the Na$_x$CoO$_2$ system. For
example, we show that the anomalous thermopower and Hall effect observed in
Na$_{0.7}$CoO$_2$ may be interpreted along these lines. If the repulsion is
strong, it can also lead to charge order; nevertheless, away from the
commensurate dopings, the configurational constraints allow some mobility for
the charge carriers, i.e., there remains some ``metallic'' component. Finally,
the particularly strong bandwidth suppression around the commensurate $x=1/3$
can help resurrect the RVB superconductivity, which would otherwise not be
expected near this high doping. These suggestions are demonstrated specifically
for a $tJ$-like model with an additional nearest neighbor repulsion.

inelasticity on the structure of the non-equilibrium states, in particular on
the behavior of the velocity distribution in the high energy tails. Starting
point is the nonlinear Boltzmann equation for spatially homogeneous systems,
which supposedly describes the behavior of the velocity distribution function
in dissipative systems as long as the system remains in the homogeneous cooling
state, i.e. on relatively short time scales before the clustering and similar
instabilities start to create spatial inhomogeneities. This is done for the two
most common models for dissipative systems, i.e. inelastic hard spheres and
inelastic Maxwell particles. In systems of Maxwell particles the collision
frequency is independent of the relative velocity of the colliding particles,
and in hard sphere systems it is linear. We then demonstrate the existence of
scaling solutions for the velocity distribution function, $F(v,t) \sim
v_0(t)^{-d} f((v/v_0(t))$, where $v_0$ is the r.m.s. velocity. The scaling form
$f(c)$ shows overpopulation in the high energy tails. In the case of freely
cooling systems the tails are of algebraic form, $ f(c)\sim c^{-d-a}$, where
the exponent $a$ may or may not depend on the degree of inelasticity, and in
the case of forced systems the tails are of stretched Gaussian type
$f(v)\sim\exp[-\beta (v/v_0)^b]$ with $b <2$.

decay exponentially with the distance between the contact. In this paper we
propose a new structure in which this novel non-local effect is increased by
orders of magnitude. We study the spin-dependent electronic transport of a
diffusive nanojunction and demonstrate that when a normal diffusive region is
placed between the F leads and superconductor, the non-local initially
increases with the separation between the F leads, achieving a maximum and
decays as a power law with increasing separation.

sensitivity of DNA chips. Competitive surface hybridization occurs when
different targets can hybridize with the same probe. Competitive bulk
hybridization takes place when the targets can hybridize with free
complementary chains in the solution. The effects of competitive hybridization
on the thermodynamically attainable performance of DNA chips are quantified in
terms of the hybridization isotherms of the spots. These relate the equilibrium
degree of the hybridization to the bulk composition. The hybridization isotherm
emerges as a Langmuir isotherm modified for electrostatic interactions within
the probe layer. The sensitivity of the assay in equilibrium is directly
related to the slope of the isotherm. A simpler description is possible in
terms of $c_{50}$s specifying the bulk composition corresponding to 50%
hybridization at the surface. The effects of competitive hybridization are
important for the quantitative analysis of DNA chip results especially when

short-range magnetic correlations. The crystal-field splitting in YbB12

domain, often resort to exploratory ``trial-and-error'' queries since the
underlying data space is huge and unfamiliar, and there are several
alternatives for search attributes in this space. For example, scouting for
cheap airfares typically involves posing multiple queries, varying flight
times, dates, and airport locations. Exploratory queries are problematic from
the perspective of both the user and the server. For the database server, it
results in a drastic reduction in effective throughput since much of the
processing is duplicated in each successive query. For the client, it results
in a marked increase in response times, especially when accessing the service

  In this paper, we investigate the design of automated techniques to minimize
the need for repetitive exploratory queries. Specifically, we present SAUNA, a
server-side query relaxation algorithm that, given the user's initial range
query and a desired cardinality for the answer set, produces a relaxed query
that is expected to contain the required number of answers. The algorithm
incorporates a range-query-specific distance metric that is weighted to produce
relaxed queries of a desired shape (e.g. aspect ratio preserving), and utilizes
multi-dimensional histograms for query size estimation. A detailed performance
evaluation of SAUNA over a variety of multi-dimensional data sets indicates
that its relaxed queries can significantly reduce the costs associated with

an effective colorless field, which satisfies Maxwell equation with nonzero

GeV is incompatible with a number of experimental results. Moreover, the error
they adscribe to the $\delta_0^{(0)}$ phase at 0.8 GeV, an important part of
their input, is much underestimated, and its central value is probably
displaced. Then, we compare CGL results with direct fits to experimental
$\pi\pi$ data; the outcome of this test is mismatch of the CGL amplitude, for
several quantities by as much as 4 standard deviations. We also evaluate
forward dispersion relations with the CGL amplitudes. We find that these
dispersion relations are fulfilled less and less well as the energy increases
towards 0.8 GeV. Moreover, the size that the experimental results for $\pi\pi$
scattering indicates for the two loop corrections in a chiral perturbation
theory analysis is less than those required by CGL, which suggests that at
least some of the CGL corrections are so large to cover biases in their
$\pi\pi$ amplitude and in the evaluation of the scalar form factor of the pion.

to (i) or (ii) is (nearly) massless then it will show up as a long range
composition dependent fifth force between macroscopic objects. Such a force
will also influence neutrino oscillations due to its flavour-dependence. We
show that the latter effect is quite significant in spite of very strong
constraints on the relevant gauge couplings from the fifth force experiments.
In particular, the $L_{e}- L_{\mu,\tau}$ potential of the electrons in the Sun

Super-K data of oscillation of multi-GeV atmospheric neutrinos can be used to

$\alpha_{e\mu}< 5.5 \times 10^{-52}$at 90% CL when the range of the force is

Taking advantage of the Feynman-Schwinger representation for the iterated quark
propagator in an external field, it is possible to give closed representations
for certain appropriate (second order) two point and four point Green
functions, H^(2)(x-y) and H^(4)(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2), as path integrals on quark
world lines. Then, starting from reasonable assumptions on the Wilson line
correlators, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for H^(4) and a Dyson-Schwinger equation
for H^(2) can be obtained, which are consistent with the Goldstone theorem in
the chiral limit. Such equations are too complicate to be solved directly.
However, a reduced Salpeter equation can be derived which is tractable and has
been applied to a calculation of the meson spectrum. The results are in general
good agreement with the data, but with the important exceptions of the light
pseudo scalars (that are related to the breaking of the chiral symmetry). In
this scenario two important improvements can be introduced: a) the fixed
coupling constant can be replaced by a running coupling constant
\alpha_{s}(Q^2) appropriately modified in the infrared region; b) the fixed
mass in the reduced equation can be replaced for light quarks by an effective
mass depending on the momentum of the particle, as suggested by the form of the
DS equation. Then even the light pseudo scalar mesons can be made to agree with
to their experimental value.

Ahoronov-Bohm effect. Moreover, when charge conjugation is taken into account,
the existence of a non-trivial ground state of the Higgs boson is shown to be
equivalent to the triviality of the electroweak gauge bundle. As a consequence,
the gauge bundle of the electromagnetic interaction must also be trivial.

Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket of multivector fields on $M$ to the Schouten-Jacobi
bracket of first-order polydifferential operators on $N$ and generalizes the
Poissonization of Jacobi manifolds. Actually, it can be viewed as a
super-Poissonization. This procedure of passing from a homogeneous multivector
field to a first-order polydifferential operator can be also understood as a
sort of reduction; in the standard case -- a half of a Poisson reduction. A
dual version of the above correspondence yields in particular the

cotangent bundle of the manifold to a cotangent bundle over the boundary at
infinity; it is associated to a sojourn time, or Busemann function, for
geodesic rays. In non-degenerate cases, the symbol of the operator can be
described explicitly in terms of the geometry of long-time geodesic flow.

the 133Cs ground state and of the black body radiation shift induced on the
transition frequency between the two hyperfine levels with m_F = 0. This shift
is of fundamental importance in the evaluation of the accuracy of the primary
frequency standards based on atomic fountains and employed in the realization
of the SI second in the International Atomic Time (TAI) scale at the level of
1e-15. Our computed value for the polarizability is alpha_0=6.600(16)e-39
Cm^2/V in agreement at the level of 1e-3 with recent theoretical and
experimental values. As regards the black body radiation shift we .nd for the
relative hyper.ne transition frequency beta=-1.49 (7)e-14 at T = 300 K in
agreement with frequency measurements reported by our group and by Bauch and
Schroder [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 622, (1997)]. This value is lower by 2e-15 than
that obtained with measurements based on the dc Stark shift and than the value
commonly accepted up to now.

or carving skis, describes a perfect carved turn in which the edges of the ski
alone, not the ski surface, describe the trajectory followed by the skier,
without any slipping or skidding. In this article, we derive the
""ideal-carving"" equation which describes the physics of a carved turn under
ideal conditions. The laws of Newtonian classical mechanics are applied. The
parameters of the ideal-carving equation are the inclination of the ski slope,
the acceleration of gravity, and the sidecut radius of the ski. The variables
of the ideal-carving equation are the velocity of the skier, the angle between
the trajectory of the skier and the horizontal, and the instantaneous curvature
radius of the skier's trajectory. Relations between the slope inclination and
the velocity range suited for nearly ideal carving are discussed, as well as
implications for the design of carving skis and snowboards.

snow, which gradually transforms into ice crystals as the layer sinks into the
ice sheet. The size distribution of ice crystals has been measured at selected
depths in the upper 880 m of the NorthGRIP ice core (Svensson and others,
2003b), which covers a time span of 5300 years. The distributions change with
time toward a universal curve, indicating a common underlying physical process
in the formation of crystals. We identify this process as an interplay between
fragmentation of the crystals and diffusion of their grain boundaries. The
process is described by a two-parameter differential equation to which we
obtain the exact solution. The solution is in excellent agreement with the
experimentally observed distributions.

systems that make use of conformational mobility (i.e. hindered rotation around
chemical bonds and molecular construction deformations with formation and
breakage of nonvalent bonds). Components of molecular machines move mainly by
means of restricted diffusion. As an example of molecular machines of a
nonbiological nature catenanes (compounds with two interlocked molecular
rings)can be proposed. Thus, for example, model catenane

lena-3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29-decaoxatnacontaphane)-catenane)
changes its redox status when an electric field is applied, and rotation of the
rings takes place. It occurs with fixation at certain moments of the influence.
To find out characteristic properties of rings movements under various external
conditions molecular dynamics simulation was carried out. Three cationic forms
of the catenane were first subjected to geometrical optimization and quantum
chemical calculation.

determination in microwave plasma has been expanded for B, Al, Ga, Si atoms and
generalized. The method is based on measurements of relative intensities of
pairs of spectral lines belonging to resonance multiplets having common upper
level. It is shown that when the reabsorption of the lines within plasma is
sufficient, then the intensity ratios depend on the gas temperature T and the
product NL of total density of the ground state atoms N and a length of a
plasma column L.
  Thus in the case of the B, Al, Ga doublets the temperature T should be known.
The resonance multiplet of Si (three independent intensity ratios) provides an
opportunity to obtain both T and N and even to organize internal check of the
applicability of the proposed method to certain plasma conditions.
  The ratios were calculated for resonance lines of B, Al, Ga and Si under
T=300-2400 K and NL=10^7-10^15 cm^(-3) m. The results of numerical calculations
and ranges of applicability of the method are discussed.

two parameters, one being a measure of the sphericity and the other that
describes the shape. For the folded states, whose interiors are densely packed,
the radii of gyration (Rg) and these two parameters are calculated using the
coordinates of the experimentally determined structures. Although Rg scales as
expected for maximally compact structures, the distributions of the shape
parameters show that there is considerable asymmetry in the shapes of folded
structures. The degree of asymmetry is greater for proteins that form
oligomers. Analysis of the two- and three-body contacts in the native
structures shows that the presence of near equal number of contacts between
backbone and side-chains and between side-chains gives rise to dense packing.
We suggest that proteins with relatively large values of shape parameters can
tolerate volume mutations without greatly affecting the network of contacts or
their stability. To probe shape characteristics of denatured states we have
developed a model of a WW-like domain. The shape parameters, which are
calculated using Langevin simulations, change dramatically in the course of
coil to globule transition. Comparison of the values of shape parameters
between the globular state and the folded state of WW domain shows that both
energetic (especially dispersion in the hydrophobic interactions) and steric
effects are important in determining packing in proteins.

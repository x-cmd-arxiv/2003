first order Fermi acceleration. The linear theory is successful in describing
the acceleration process as long as the pressure of the accelerated particles
remains negligible compared to the kinetic pressure of the incoming gas (the
so-called test particle approximation). When this condition is no longer
fulfilled, the shock is modified by the pressure of the accelerated particles
in a nonlinear way, namely the spectrum of accelerated particles and the shock
structure determine each other. In this paper we present the first description
of the nonlinear regime of shock acceleration when the shock propagates in a
medium where seed particles are already present. This case may apply for
instance to supernova shocks propagating into the interstellar medium, where
cosmic rays are in equipartition with the gas pressure. We find that the
appearance of multiple solutions, previously found in alternative descriptions
of the nonlinear regime, occurs also for the case of reacceleration of seed
particles. Moreover, for parameters of concern for supernova shocks, the shock
is likely to turn nonlinear mainly due to the presence of the pre-existing
cosmic rays, rather than due to the acceleration of new particles from the
thermal pool. We investigate here the onset of the nonlinear regime for the
three following cases: 1) seed particles in equipartition with the gas
pressure; 2) particles accelerated from the thermal pool; 3) combination of 1)

these processes, using two-dimensional numerical hydrodynamic and
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with conditions appropriate for the
atomic interstellar medium (ISM). We demonstrate, consistent with previous
work, that nonlinear development of ``pure TI'' produces a network of filaments
that condense into cold clouds at their intersections, yielding a distinct
two-phase warm/cold medium within about 20 Myr. TI-driven turbulent motions of
the clouds saturate at subsonic amplitudes for uniform initial P/k=2000 K
cm^-3. MRI has previously been studied in near-uniform media; our simulations
include both TI+MRI models, which begin from uniform-density conditions, and
cloud+MRI models, which begin with a two-phase cloudy medium. Both the TI+MRI
and cloud+MRI models show that MRI develops within a few galactic orbital
times, just as for a uniform medium. The mean separation between clouds can
affect which MRI mode dominates the evolution. Provided intercloud separations
do not exceed half the MRI wavelength, we find the MRI growth rates are similar
to those for the corresponding uniform medium. This opens the possibility, if
low cloud volume filling factors increase MRI dissipation times compared to
those in a uniform medium, that MRI-driven motions in the ISM could reach
amplitudes comparable to observed HI turbulent linewidths.

each multipole order l is represented by l unit vectors pointing in directions
on the sky and an overall magnitude. These ""multipole vectors and scalars""
transform as vectors under rotations. Like the usual spherical harmonics,
multipole vectors form an irreducible representation of the proper rotation
group SO(3). However, they are related to the familiar spherical harmonic
coefficients, alm, in a nonlinear way, and are therefore sensitive to different
aspects of the CMB anisotropy. Nevertheless, it is straightforward to determine
the multipole vectors for a given CMB map and we present an algorithm to
compute them. Using the WMAP full-sky maps, we perform several tests of the
hypothesis that the CMB anisotropy is statistically isotropic and Gaussian
random. We find that the result from comparing the oriented area of planes
defined by these vectors between multipole pairs 2<=l1!=l2<=8 is inconsistent
with the isotropic Gaussian hypothesis at the 99.4% level for the ILC map and
at 98.9% level for the cleaned map of Tegmark et al. A particular correlation
is suggested between the l=3 and l=8 multipoles, as well as several other
pairs. This effect is entirely different from the now familiar planarity and
alignment of the quadrupole and octupole: while the aforementioned is fairly
unlikely, the multipole vectors indicate correlations not expected in Gaussian
random skies that make them unusually likely. The result persists after
accounting for pixel noise and after assuming a residual 10% dust contamination
in the cleaned WMAP map. While the definitive analysis of these results will
require more work, we hope that multipole vectors will become a valuable tool
for various cosmological tests, in particular those of cosmic isotropy.

conduction, for bubbles to be persistent enough to be regularly observed, they

unmitigated by magnetic fields can dissipate the bubbles even faster. We also

from the spin accumulation $\bar{\Delta\mu}$. Existing calculations of
$\bar{\Delta\mu}$ assume a uniform cross section of conductors. But most
multilayer samples are pillars with current leads flaring out immediately to a
much wider cross-section area than that of the pillar itself. We write
spin-diffusion equations of a form valid for variable cross section, and solve
the case of flat electrodes with radial current distribution perpendicular to
the axis of the pillar. Because of the increased volume available for
conduction-electron spin relaxation in such leads, $\bar{\Delta\mu}$ is reduced
in the pillar by at least a factor of 2 below its value for uniform cross
section, for given current density in the pillar. Also, $\bar{\Delta\mu}$ and
the critical current density for spin precession become nearly independent of
the thickness of the pinned magnetic layer, and more dependent on the thickness
of the spacer, in better agreement with measurements by Albert et al. (2002).

of a ferromagnetic metal is well known to produce spin accumulation at the
boundary with a normal metal when a current is injected through the interface.
However, little emphasis has been put on the density of states (DOS) asymmetry
in diffusive ferromagnetic-nonferromagnetic multilayers. We found that if DOS
and conduction asymmetry differ, the electric potential in a ferromagnet falls
off to its bulk value exponentially on a scale of the spin diffusion length.
Therefore the boundary contribution to resistance dramatically depends on
whether the potential difference is measured close to the interface or farther
than the spin diffusion length from it. This result is not altered by taking
surface resistance or spin-flips on the intermetallic boundary into account.
Explicit answers for common multilayered spin-valve structures are given.

  At \emph{finite} temperatures the localization transition is suppressed: the
random potential is wiped out by thermal fluctuations on length scales larger
than the thermal de Broglie wave length of the phason excitations. The
existence of a zero temperature transition is reflected in a rich cross-over

different scaling regions: a \emph{classical disordered}, a \emph{quantum

boundary value problem with negative exponent similar to standard Emden--Fowler
equation. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of $C[0,1]$
positive solutions as well as $C^{1}[0,1]$ positive solutions is given by means
of the method of lower and upper solutions with the Schauder fixed point
theorem.

  17-20, 2003, Fermilab. 9 pages with 5 figures",,,,"nucl-ex",,"  The strong electromagnetic fields of heavy nuclei can produce a wide variety
of two-photon and photonuclear reactions at relativistic ion colliders. We
present recent results from the STAR collaboration on these `ultra-peripheral'
interactions, focusing on vector meson production and interferometry, and on
$e^+e^-$ pair production. The vector meson interferometry occurs because of the
symmetric initial state: nucleus 1 can emit a photon which scatters from
nucleus 2, emerging as a vector meson, or vice-versa. The two processes are
indistinguishable, and so interfere, even though the production points are
separated enough that the produced mesons decay before their wave functions can
overlap, so the system can be used for interesting tests of quantum mechanics.

mechanism which is formulated within the framework of the post form distorted
wave Born approximation is discussed in detail. In this theory, which requires
the information about only the ground state wave function of the projectile,
the fragment-target interactions are included to all orders while
fragment-fragment interaction is treated only in the first order. The general
applicability of this theory to describe the breakup of halo nuclei is
demonstrated by comparing the calculations with data for total, as well as
energy and angle integrated cross sections and momentum distributions of
fragments in reactions induced by a number of halo nuclei. We investigate the
role played by the pure Coulomb, pure nuclear and the Coulomb-nuclear
interference terms. Postacceleration effects in the Coulomb breakup of neutron
halo nuclei is also studied.

spatial-asymmetric dissociation of molecules in a laser field is proposed. The
concept of geometrical alignment is sufficient for explanation of these
results. In this case the spatial anisotropy of interaction of molecules with
laser radiation is transferred from one field to another through the ordinary
mechanism of nonlinear optical interactions. Thus laser radiation does not
create alignment, but only registers it. A physical basis of such nonlinear
processes is inequality of forward and reversed optical transitions that
corresponds to a concept of time invariance violation in electromagnetic
interactions. Directions of the further researches in the field of alignment
spectroscopy are discussed.

evolution of postselected quantum systems. It appears to be useful for
resolving a variety of thorny quantum paradoxes, particularly when used to
study properties of pairs of particles. Unfortunately, such nonlocal or joint
observables often prove difficult to measure weakly in practice (for instance,
in optics -- a common testing ground for this technique -- strong photon-photon
interactions would be needed). Here we derive a general, experimentally
feasible, method for extracting these values from correlations between
single-particle observables.

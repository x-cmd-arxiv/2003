redshifts z<0.01. The Seyfert galaxies are characterized by moderate
luminosities (L<10^46 erg/s) and weak radio and X-ray emission.

there is a clear correlation between spectral index and median source size,
with the flat spectrum sources being much smaller on average. Ultra-steep
spectrum objects (alpha < -1.2) are identified, and we present high resolution
VLA follow-up observations of these sources which, identified at such a low

generally have well-defined thermal properties, we find that the GSL is

asymptotically de Sitter universe filled with a gas of small black holes as a
means of casting light on the relative entropic 'worth' of black hole versus

injected in its central plane. Dimensional analysis shows that the solution
must depend on three dimensionless parameters. To study the nonlinear,
turbulent evolution of such a slab, we use 1D high resolution numerical
simulations. For a parameter range inspired by molecular cloud observations, we
find the following. 1) A single source of energy injection is sufficient to
force persistent supersonic turbulence over several hydrostatic scale heights.
2) The time averaged spatial extension of the slab is comparable to the
extension of the stationary, analytical WKB solution. Deviations, as well as
the density substructure of the slab, depend on the wave-length of the injected
wave. 3) Energy losses are dominated by loss of Poynting-flux and increase with
increasing plasma beta. 4) Good spatial resolution is mandatory, making similar
simulations in 3D currently prohibitively expensive.

  interaction network","16 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables","Nature Genetics, 35(2), 176-179, (2003)",,,"q-bio.GN cond-mat",,"  Understanding why some cellular components are conserved across species,
while others evolve rapidly is a key question of modern biology. Here we
demonstrate that in S. cerevisiae proteins organized in cohesive patterns of
interactions are conserved to a significantly higher degree than those that do
not participate in such motifs. We find that the conservation of proteins
within distinct topological motifs correlates with the motif's
inter-connectedness and function and also depends on the structure of the
overall interactome topology. These findings indicate that motifs may represent
evolutionary conserved topological units of cellular networks molded in
accordance with the specific biological function in which they participate.

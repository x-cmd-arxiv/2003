  Cosmologies","19 pages and 23 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present the results of a series of gas dynamical cosmological simulations
of the formation of individual massive field galaxies in the standard
concordance \LCDM and in a \LWDM cosmology. The galaxies form in an initial
burst of star formation followed by accretion of small satellites. The
simulated galaxies are old ($\approx$ 10 $Gyrs$) hot stellar systems with
masses of $\approx 1.7 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. Baryonic matter dominates the
mass in the luminous part of the galaxies up to $\approx 5$ effective radii.
The \LCDM galaxy is a slowly rotating spheroidal stellar system (E2) with
predominantly disky isophotes. The line-of-sight velocity distributions deviate
from Gaussian shape and $h_3$ is anticorrelated with $v_{los}$. The
corresponding \LWDM galaxy is more elongated (E3 - E4) and rotates faster. The
anisotropy parameter $(v/\sigma)^*$ is close to unity. Within the uncertainties
of $M/L$ both galaxies follow the Fundamental Plane. We conclude that the
properties of the two galaxies simulated in the \LCDM and \LWDM cosmology are
in good agreement with observations of intermediate mass elliptical or S0
galaxies (abstract abbreviated).

parameters from the best-fitting Sersic r^{1/n} bulge plus, where appropriate,

galaxy redshifts in the direction of Coma, we find that 163 of the 187 galaxies
are Coma cluster members, and the rest are foreground and background objects.
For the Coma cluster members, we have studied differences in the structural and
kinematic properties between early- and late-type galaxies, and between the
dwarf and giant galaxies. Analysis of the elliptical galaxies reveals
correlations among the structural parameters similar to those previously found
in the Virgo and Fornax clusters. Comparing the structural properties of the
Coma cluster disc galaxies with disc galaxies in the field, we find evidence
for an environmental dependence: the scale lengths of the disc galaxies in Coma
are 30% smaller. A kinematical analysis shows marginal differences between the
velocity distributions of ellipticals with Sersic index n<2 (dwarfs) and those
with n>2 (giants); the dwarf galaxies having a greater (cluster) velocity
dispersion. Finally, our analysis of all 421 background galaxies reveals a
non-uniform distribution in redshift with contrasts in density ~3,
characterized by a void extending from ~10,000 to ~20,000 km s^{-1}, and two
dense and extended structures centred at ~20,000 and ~47,000 km s^{-1}.

of a cosmological constant or other forms of dark energy. Several studies raise
concerns about the evolution of SNe Ia (e.g., the peculiarity rate, the
risetime, and the color of SNe Ia at different redshifts), but all these
studies suffer from the difficulties of obtaining high-quality spectroscopy and
photometry for SNe Ia at high redshifts. There are also some troubling cases of
SNe Ia that provide counterexamples to the observed correlations, suggesting
that a secondary parameter is necessary to describe the whole SN Ia family.

suggests a short life time for AGN activity of the order ~10^6-10^7 years.

We first analyze the observed emission in the LTE approximation, and derive
rotational temperatures between 11 and 40 K, and column densities between 1 and
20 x 10^13 cm^-2. Second, we use a LVG code and derive larger kinetic
temperatures, between 30 and 90 K, consistent with subthermally populated
levels and densities from 1 to 6 x 10^5 cm^-3. The column densities from the
LVG modeling are within a factor of 10 with respect to those derived in the LTE
approximation. Finally, we analyze the observations based upon detailed models
for the envelopes surrounding the protostars, using temperature and density
profiles previously derived from continuum observations. We approximate the
formaldehyde abundance across the envelope with a jump function, the jump
occurring when the dust temperature reaches 100 K, the evaporation temperature
of the grain mantles. The observed formaldehyde emission is well reproduced
only if there is a jump, more than two orders of magnitude, in four sources. In
the remaining four sources the data are consistent with a formaldehyde
abundance jump, but the evidence is more marginal (~2 sigma). The inferred
inner H2CO abundance varies between 1 x 10^-8 and 6 x 10^-6. We discuss the
implications of these jumps for our understanding of the origin and evolution

microlensing surveys looking for massive compact halo objects (Machos). A
long-standing theoretical prediction is that the high inclination of the M31
disk should induce an asymmetry in the spatial distribution of M31 Macho
events, whilst the distribution of variable stars and microlensing events in
the M31 disk should be symmetric. We examine the role of stars in the M31
visible spheroid as both lenses and sources to microlensing events. We compute
microlensing event number density maps and estimate pixel-lensing rates and
event durations for three-component models of M31 which are consistent with the
observed rotation curve, surface brightness profile and dynamical mass
estimates. Three extreme models are considered: a massive spheroid model; a
massive disk model; and a massive Macho halo model. An important consequence of
the spheroid is that, even if Machos are absent in M31, an asymmetric spatial
signature is still generally expected from stellar lensing alone. The relative
mass-to-light ratio of the spheroid and disk populations controls which of
these signatures dominates the overall stellar spatial distribution. We find
that the inclusion of the spheroid weakens the M31 Macho spatial asymmetry by
about 20-30% over a disk-only asymmetry for the models considered. We also find
for our models that Machos dominate over most of the far disk provided they
contribute at least ~25% of the halo dark matter density. The presence of the
spheroid also has beneficial consequences for M31 lensing surveys. The stellar
asymmetry is likely to be important in distinguishing between a spheroidal
Macho halo or a highly flattened halo or dark matter dominated disk, since
spatial asymmetries of opposing signs are expected in these cases. (Abridged)

1976--2003 the properties of the cyclic evolution of the large-scale magnetic
field are investigated. Some regularities are found in longitudinal and
latitudinal evolution of the magnetic field in cycles 21, 22 and 23. The cyclic
development of the large-scale magnetic field can be divided into two main
phases. The phase I, which includes a period approximately from two years
before and until three years after the maximum of the solar cycle, is studied
in detail. It is found that before the reversal of the large-scale magnetic
field the neutral line of the magnetic field in antipodal longitudinal
intervals shifts from the equator to opposite directions in cycles 21 and 22,
but not in cycle 23. During the sign reversal of the large-scale magnetic field
in cycles 21 and 22 in the antipodal longitudinal intervals the magnetic field
of opposite polarity is observed in all latitudes, thereby forming an
equatorial dipole. After the magnetic field reversal a longitudinal oscillation
of the magnetic neutral line with regard to the equator takes place, which has
a period about 2 years and damps to the minimum of the 11-year cycle. The
intervening longitudinal intervals of the large-scale magnetic field correspond
to positions of the active longitudes of sunspot activity, thus indicating a
close connection of the large-scale and the local magnetic fields. In evolution
of the large-scale magnetic field a periodicity with period $1.23\pm0.16$ year
is revealed, which is close to the period found by helioseismological methods
in variations of the solar rotation near the tachocline.

different spatial scales in a sample of infrared bright galaxies. ISO
observations which include emission of the nucleus as well as most of the host
galaxy are compared with TIMMI2 spectra of the nuclear region. We find that ISO
spectra are generally dominated by strong PAH bands. However, this is no longer
true when inspecting the mid-infrared emission of the pure nucleus. Here PAH
emission is detected in starbursts whereas it is significantly reduced or
completely absent in AGNs. A physical explanation of these new observational
results is presented by examining the temperature fluctuation of a PAH after
interaction with a photon. It turns out that the hardness of the radiation
field is a key parameter for quantifying the photo-destruction of small grains.
Our theoretical study predicts PAH evaporation in soft X-ray environments.
Radiative transfer calculations of clumpy starbursts and AGN corroborate the
observational fact that PAH emission is connected to starburst activity whereas
PAHs are destroyed near an AGN. The radiative transfer models predict for
starbursts a much larger mid-infrared size than for AGN. This is confirmed by
our TIMMI2 acquisition images: We find that the mid-infrared emission of
Seyferts is dominated by a compact core while most of the starbursts are
spatially resolved.

1940s, is not fitting the current knowledge on non-linear systems. Borrowed
from plasma physics when several fundamental features of perturbed non-linear
systems were unknown, that framework ignores the difference in the role of
perturbations in two different classes of systems, in plasma with Debye
screening and gravitating systems with no screening. Now, when the
revolutionary role of chaotic effects is revealed even in planetary dynamics
i.e. for nearly integrable systems, one would expect that for stellar systems,
i.e. non-integrable systems, their role have to be far more crucial. Indeed,
ergodic theory tools already enabled to prove that spherical stellar systems
are exponentially instable due to N-body interactions, while the two-body
encounters, contrary to existing belief, are not the dominating mechanism of
their relaxation. Chaotic effects distinguish morphological and other
properties of galaxies. Using the Ricci curvature criterion, one can also show
that a central massive object (nucleus) makes the N-body gravitating system
more instable (chaotic), while systems with double nuclei are even more
instable than those with a single one.

a heavily absorbed, hard X-ray power law of variable luminosity, plus a
constant, thermal soft X-ray component. We do not detect an iron K alpha

absorption features are seen with >99.5% confidence at ~6.4 keV and ~6.9 keV,
which we identify as resonant absorption lines of Fe XVIII - Fe XIX K alpha and
Fe XXVI K alpha, respectively. In addition, the 6.9 keV absorption line is
probably variable on a timescale of ~6000 sec. The absorption lines are
analyzed through a curve of growth analysis, which allows the relationship
between ionic column and kinematic temperature or velocity dispersion to be
obtained for the observed equivalent widths. We discuss the properties of the
absorbing gas for both photo and collisionally ionized models. Given that the
maser disk is viewed at an inclination i = 82 degrees, the gas responsible for
the 6.9 keV absorption line may be in an inner disk, a disk-wind boundary layer

leading to coherent behaviour of the society members. This paper examines,
within a simple numerical simulation, the various effects that may lead to norm
formation and stability. The approach has been first used by Axelrod, who
proposed two step model of norm and meta-norm enforcement. We present here an
extension and detailed analysis of the original work, as well as several new

out that a relatively simple model for simulated norm enforcement predicts
persistent norm breaking even when it is associated with high punishment

for breaking the norm and proximity of norm enforcers. We also study a totally
different mechanism of norm establishment, without meta-norms but using instead
the direct bonus mechanism to norm-enforcers.

translocation of RNA or DNA is biased due to the different chemical
environments on the two sides of the membrane, while the molecular motor motion
is biased through a coupling to chemical energy. An externally applied force
can oppose these biases. For both systems we solve lattice models exactly both
with and without disorder. The models incorporate explicitly the coupling to
the different chemical environments for polymer translocation and the coupling
to the chemical energy (as well as nucleotide pairing energies) for molecular
motors. Using the exact solutions and general arguments we show that the
heterogeneity leads to anomalous dynamics. Most notably, over a range of forces
around the stall force (or stall tension for DNA polymerase/exonuclease
systems) the displacement grows sublinearly as t^\mu with \mu<1. The range over
which this behavior can be observed experimentally is estimated for several
systems and argued to be detectable for appropriate forces and buffers. Similar

as a canonical transformation group in phase space. Yet there is a larger
field-dependent symmetry transformation group which does faithfully reproduce
4-D diffeomorphism symmetries. Some properties of this group were first
explored by Bergmann and Komar. More recently the group has been analyzed from
the perspective of projectability under the Legendre map. Time translation is
not a realizeable symmetry, and is therefore distinct from
diffeomorphism-induced symmetries. This issue is explored further in this
paper. It is shown that time is not ""frozen"". Indeed, time-like diffeomorphism
invariants must be time-dependent. Intrinsic coordinates of the type proposed
by Bergmann and Komar are used to construct invariants. Lapse and shift
variables are retained as canonical variables in this approach, and therefore
will be subject to quantum fluctuations in an eventual quantum theory. Concepts
and constructions are illustrated using the relativistic classical and quantum
free particle. In this example concrete time-dependent invariants are displayed
and fluctuation in proper time is manifest.

generally curved Dirichlet p-branes possess an extended local isometry group,
which can be absorbed into the brane geometry as an almost product structure.
The induced kinematics encode two invariant scales, namely a minimal length and
a maximal speed, without breaking general covariance. Quantum gravity effects
on D-branes at low energy are then seen to manifest themselves by the
kinematical effects of a maximal acceleration. Experimental and theoretical
implications of such new kinematics are easily derived. We comment on

determination of the amount of cold dark matter in the universe from analyses
using WMAP data. The implications of this data for the mSUGRA parameter space
are analyzed. It is shown that the data admits solutions on the hyperbolic
branch (HB) of the radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry. A part of
the hyperbolic branch lies in the so called inversion region where the LSP
neutralino $\chi_1^0$ becomes essentially a pure Higgsino and degenerate with
the next to the lightest neutralino $\chi_2^0$ and the light chargino
$\chi_1^{\pm}$. Thus some of the conventional signals for the observation of
supersymmetry at colliders (e.g., the missing energy signals) do not operate in
this region. On the other hand the inversion region contains a high degree of
degeneracy of $\chi_1^0$, $\chi_2^0$, $\chi_1^{\pm}$ leading to coannihilations
which allow for the satisfaction of the WMAP relic density constraints deep on
the hyperbolic branch. Further, an analysis of the neutralino-proton cross
sections in this region reveals that this region can still be accessible to
dark matter experiments in the future. Constraints from $g_{\mu}-2$ and from
$B^0_s\to \mu^+\mu^-$ are discussed. Future prospects are also discussed.

the nuclear collision ($b_{min} > R_1 + R_2$, where $R_i$ is the radius of ion
""$i$""). In this last case the effect of a possible nuclear radius dependence
with the energy has not been considered in detail up to now. Here we introduce
this effect showing that for final states with small invariant mass the effect
is negligible. However when the final state has a relatively large invariant
mass, e.g. an intermediate mass Higgs boson, the cross section can decrease up
to 50%.

  Reflections, Barcelona, Spain, 2003",,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.geo-ph",,"  We report results from the Eddy Experiment, where a synchronous GPS receiver
pair was flown on an aircraft to collect sampled L1 signals and their
reflections from the sea surface to investigate the altimetric accuracy of
GNSS-R. During the experiment, surface wind speed (U10) was of the order of 10
m/s, and significant wave heights of up to 2 m, as discussed further in a
companion paper. After software tracking of the two signals through despreading
of the GPS codes, a parametric waveform model containing the description of the
sea surface conditions has been used to fit the waveforms (retracking) and
estimate the temporal lapse between the direct GPS signals and their
reflections. The estimated lapses have then been used to estimate the sea
surface height (SSH) along the aircraft track using a differential geometric
model. As expected, the precision of GNSS-R ranges was of 3 m after 1 second
integration. More importantly, the accuracy of the GNSS-R altimetric solution
with respect to Jason-1 SSH and in situ GPS buoy measurements was of 10 cm,
which was the target with the used experimental setup. This new result confirms
the potential of GNSS-R for mesoscale altimetric monitoring of the ocean, and
provides an important milestone on the road to a space mission.

general protocols are mainly based on the unitary transformation on the

protocol, the entanglement distillation includes two meanings, namely,
extracting the concentrated tripartite entangled W state and obtaining the
maximally entangled bipartite state from the garbage state, which gives no
contribution to the distillation of non-maximally entangled pure W class state.
We can make use of the garbage in the distillation process, and make the
entanglement waste in quantum communication as small as possible. A feasible
physical scheme is suggested based on the cavity QED.

an arbitrary unknown input state (not only a coherent state) can be restored in

We generalize this concept to a partial LOCC reversal of the cloning and we
show that this procedure converts the symmetric cloner to an asymmetric cloner.
Further, we discuss a distributed LOCC reversal in optimal $1\to M$ Gaussian
cloning of coherent states which transforms it to optimal $1\to M'$ cloning for
$M'<M$. Assuming the quantum cloning as a possible eavesdropping attack on

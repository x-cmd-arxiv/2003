magnitudes of 25.6 and 24.1 in the J- and Ks-bands respectively. The image
quality is 0.45 arc seconds in both passbands. We use these data to construct a
colour-magnitude (C-M) diagram of galaxies that are within 20 arc seconds of
the cluster center and brighter than Ks=24, which is five magnitudes fainter
than the apparent magnitude of a L* galaxy in this cluster. The C-M relation is
clearly identified as an over-density of galaxies with colours near J-Ks=1.85.
The slope of the relation is -0.05 and the intrinsic scatter is 0.06
magnitudes. Both the slope and the scatter are consistent with the values
measured for clusters at lower redshifts. These quantities have not evolved
from z=0 to z=1.24. However, significant evolution in the mean J-Ks colour is
detected. On average, the galaxies in RDCS J1252.9-2927 are 0.25 magnitudes
bluer than early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster. Using instantaneous
single-burst solar-metallicity models, the average age of galaxies in the
center of RDCS J1252.9-2927 is 2.7 Gyrs.

1+4 with the {\em Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer} satellite. The spin-down trend
of GX 1+4 was continuing, with the pulsar being at its longest period ever
measured (about 138.7 s). At the late stage of the campaign, the source entered
an extended faint state, when its X-ray (2-60 keV) flux decreased significantly
to an average level of $\sim 3 \times 10^{-10} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}$. It was
highly variable in the faint state; the flux dropped to as low as $\sim 3
\times 10^{-11} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}$. In several observations during this
period, the X-ray pulsation became undetectable. We can, therefore, conclude
conservatively that the pulsed fraction, which is normally $\gtrsim$ 70%
(peak-to-peak), must have decreased drastically in those cases. This is very
similar to what was observed of GX 1+4 in 1996 when it became similarly faint
in X-ray. In fact, the flux at which the cessation of X-ray pulsation first
occurred is nearly the same as it was in 1996. We suggest that we have, once

by theoretical models of accreting X-ray pulsars.

i.e. Thin Disk, kinematics. 16 objects have orbital velocities which differ
considerably from those of Disk stars. These are members of the Galactic Halo.
We analysed the velocity dispersions and calculated orbits. Most stars feature
orbits with disk character (eccentricity <= 0.5), a few reach far above the
Galactic plane and have very eccentric orbits (ecc >= 0.7). The intermediate
eccentricity range is poorly populated. This indicates that the (Thick) Disk
and the Halo are kinematically disjunct. Plotting a histogram of the orbit data
points along z leads to the z-distance probability distribution of the star;
doing this for all stars leads to the z-distance probability distribution of
the sample. The logarithmic histogram shows two slopes, each representing the
scale height of a population. The disk component has a scale height of 0.9
(0.1) kpc, which is consistent with earlier results and is similar to that of
the Thick Disk. The other slope represents a component with a scale height ~7
kpc, a much flatter gradient than for the disk component. This shows that the
vast majority of the sdBs are Disk stars, but a Halo minority is present, too.
The kinematic history and population membership of the sdB stars on the whole
is different from that of the cooler HBA stars, which are predominantly or even
exclusively Halo objects. This leads to the question, whether the Halo sdB
stars are of similar origin as the HBAs, or whether their kinematical behaviour

formed in situ, requiring radial transport of gas toward the center of the
disk. This transport could be a consequence of the development of the
magnetorotational instability in the differentially rotating warm neutral

that it is sufficient to support continuous star formation in that location.

formation of a compact stellar system in the central few parsecs are
unavoidable in dark matter halos with divergent density profiles. We illustrate
our conclusions on a model of the nearest late-type disk galaxy M33.

seen from Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs), was detected from the Anomalous X-ray
Pulsar (AXP) 1E 2259+586 in 2002 June. Coincident with this burst activity were
gross changes in the pulsed flux, persistent flux, energy spectrum, pulse
profile and spin down of the underlying X-ray source. We present RXTE and
XMM-Newton observations of 1E 2259+586 that show the evolution of the
aforementioned source parameters during and following this episode.
Specifically, we observe an X-ray flux increase by more than an order of
magnitude having two distinct components. The first component is linked to the
burst activity and decays within ~2 days during which the energy spectrum is
considerably harder than during the quiescent state of the source. The second
component decays over the year following the glitch according to a power law in
time with an exponent -0.22 +/- 0.01. The pulsed fraction decreased initially
to ~15% RMS, and the pulse profile changed significantly during the outburst. A
glitch was observed in 1E 2259+586 that preceded the observed burst activity. A
fraction of the glitch (~19%) recovered, although the recovery was not purely
exponential. An exponential rise of ~20% of the frequency jump with a time
scale of ~14 days results in a significantly better fit to the data, however,
contamination from a systematic drift in the phase of the pulse profile cannot
be excluded. The long-term post-glitch spin-down rate decreased in magnitude
relative to the pre-glitch value. A comparison with SGR outburst properties, a
physical interpretation of the results, and implications on the number of
magnetar candidates in our Galaxy are discussed.

the mass profile of CDM halos can be robustly estimated beyond a minimum
converged radius of order r_conv ~ 1 kpc/h in our highest resolution runs. The
density profiles of simulated halos become progressively shallow from the
virial radius inwards, and show no sign of approaching a well-defined power-law
behaviour near the centre. At r_conv, the logarithmic slope of the density
profile is steeper than the asymptotic \rho \propto r^-1 expected from the
formula proposed by Navarro, Frenk, and White (1996), but significantly
shallower than the steeply divergent \rho \propto r^-1.5 cusp proposed by Moore
et al. (1999). We perform a direct comparison of the spherically-averaged dark
matter circular velocity (V_c) profiles with rotation curves of low surface
brightness (LSB) galaxies from the samples of de Blok et al. (2001), de Blok
and Bosma (2002), and Swaters et al. (2003). Most (about two-thirds) LSB
galaxies in this dataset are roughly consistent with CDM halo V_c profiles.
However, about one third of LSBs in these samples feature a sharp transition
between the rising and flat part of the rotation curve that is not seen in the
V_c profiles of CDM halos. This discrepancy has been interpreted as excluding
the presence of cusps, but we argue that it might simply reflect the difference
between circular velocity and gas rotation speed likely to arise in gaseous
disks embedded within realistic, triaxial CDM halos.

have clearly revealed that X-ray flares occur repeatedly. In this paper, we
present the results of the time-resolved spectral analysis of the combined data
taken by ASCA, RXTE, BeppoSAX, and EUVE. In this object - and in many other TeV
blazars - the precise measurement of the shape of the X-ray spectrum, which
reflects the high energy portion of the synchrotron component, is crucial in
determining the high energy cutoff of the accelerated electrons in the jet.
Thanks to the simultaneous broadband coverage, we measured the 0.1-25 keV
spectrum resolved on time scales as short as several hours, providing a great
opportunity to investigate the detailed spectral evolution at the flares. By
analyzing the time subdivided observations, we parameterize the evolution of
the synchrotron peak, where the radiation power dominates, by fitting the
combined spectra with a quadratic form (where the vFv flux at the energy E
obeys log vFv(E)=log(vFv_peak) - const x (log E - log Epeak)^2). In this case,
we show that there is an overall trend that the peak energy Ep and peak flux
vFvp both increase or decrease together. The relation of the two parameters is
best described as Ep \propto vFvp^{0.7} for the 1998 campaign. Similar results
were derived for the 1997 observation, while the relation gave a smaller index
when included both 1997 and 1998 data. On the other hand, we show that this
relation, and also the detailed spectral variations, differ from flare to flare
within the 1998 campaign. We suggest that the observed features are consistent
with the idea that flares are due to a appearance of a new spectral component.
With the availability of the simultaneous TeV data, we also show that there
exists a clear correlation between the synchrotron peak flux and the TeV flux.

detected, in particular in the outer regions of the northwestern plume where
the transition between the main stellar body of the galaxy and a broad, low

to radiation energy is a factor of at least 10 smaller than in galactic winds

cores are found at the tips of several of the pillars. Using a stellar density
distribution, several candidate embedded clusters are also found. One is
clearly seen in the 2MASS images and is located within a dense core

regions using mid-IR colour criteria, reveal twelve candidates across the

the model prediction for the peak number counts in weak lensing mass maps

ages of the young clusters are consistent with a recent spectroscopic age
estimate of 1.6+/-0.5 Gyr for the galaxy itself (Denicolo et al. 2003) and
suggest that these clusters formed in the disk-disk merger which likely created

majority of the old clusters are not alpha-enhanced, in contrast to Galactic
and M31 GCs, and contrary to predictions of nucleosynthetic calculations. The
two old subpopulations of GCs can be attributed to the merger progenitors. The
relative numbers of old and new metal-rich GCs are poorly constrained because
of the expected differences in radial distributions of the two subpopulations.

The X-ray spectra of the source are consistent with thermal radiation from the
neutron-star surface. We found that the bolometric flux of the source decreased
by a factor of 7-9 over the time-span of 1.5 years between our first and last
Chandra observations. The effective temperature also decreased, by a factor of

can be described using exponential decay functions, with e-folding times of 0.7
and ~3 years, respectively. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that
we observed a cooling neutron-star crust which was heated considerably during
the prolonged accretion event and which is still out of thermal equilibrium
with the neutron-star core. We could only determine upper-limits for any
luminosity contribution due to the thermal state of the neutron-star core. The
rapid cooling of the neutron-star crust implies that it has a large thermal
conductivity. Our results also suggest that enhanced cooling processes are

image (with FWHM of approx. 1 arcmin), the method indirectly measures its
structure related parameters (amplitude, size, etc.) by fitting a model
function to the higher order wavelet momenents of the cluster's SZ morphology.
The applicability and accuracy of the wavelet method is assessed by applying it
to maps of a set of clusters extracted from hydrodynamical simulations of
cosmic structure formation. The parameters, derived by a fit to the spectrum of
wavelet moments as a function of scale, are found to show a dependence on
redshift z that is of the type x(z) = x_1 exp(-z/x_2) + x_3, where the monotony
of this functional behaviour and the non-degeneracy of those parameters allow
inversion and estimation of the redshift z. The average attainable accuracy in
the z-estimation relative to 1+z is approx. 4-5% out to z = 1.2, which is
comparable to photometric redshifts. For single-frequency SZ interferometers,
where the ambient fluctuating CMB is the main noise source, the accuracy of the
method drops slightly to <Delta z/(1+z)> = 6-7%.

temperature of a dilute repulsive Bose gas. Interactions modify the critical
temperature in two different ways. First, for gases in traps, temperature
shifts are introduced by a change of the density profile, arising itself from a
modification of the equation of state of the gas (reduced compressibility);
these shifts can be calculated simply within mean field theory. Second, even in
the absence of a trapping potential (homogeneous gas in a box), temperature
shifts are introduced by the interactions; they arise from the correlations
introduced in the gas, and thus lie inherently beyond mean field theory - in
fact, their evaluation requires more elaborate, non-perturbative, calculations.
One illustration of this non-perturbative character is provided by the solution
of self-consistent equations, which relate together non-linearly the various
energy shifts of the single particle levels k. These equations predict that
repulsive interactions shift the critical temperature (at constant density) by
an amount which is positive, and simply proportional to the scattering length
a; nevertheless, the numerical coefficient is difficult to compute. Physically,
the increase of the temperature can be interpreted in terms of the reduced
density fluctuations introduced by the repulsive interactions, which facilitate
the propagation of large exchange cycles across the sample.

is in contrast with conventional (Edwards) field-theories expressed in terms of
chemical potentials that have complex H. The density field theory involves the
calculation of an intermediate functional integral, which provides the entropy
of the polymer fluid at a fixed density profile. This functional integral is
positive definite and we show that in the thermodynamic limit of large systems,
it is dominated by saddle points of the integrand. This procedure side-steps
the ""sign problem"" in the chemical potential field formulation. The formalism
is illustrated in the context of models of flexible polymers. We discuss the
implications for field-theoretic computer simulations of polymeric fluids.

Field (IMTF) for pseudospins, coupled to the XY-spins on a triangular lattice.
This model appears from analyses of the quarter-filled ladder compound
$NaV_2O_5$, and pseudospins represent its charge degrees of freedom. In the
molecular-field approximation we find that the model possesses two phases:
charge-disordered without spin gap; and a low-temperature phase containing both
the anti-ferroelectric (zigzag) charge order and spin dimerization (spin gap).
The phase transition is of the second kind, and the calculated physical
quantities are as those one expects from the Landau theory. One of particular
features of the phase diagram is that the inter-ladder spin-pseudospin
coupling, responsible for the spin gap generation, also destroys the IMTF
quantum critical point, resulting in the exponential behavior of $T_c$ in the
region of Ising's coupling where the IMTF is always disordered. We conclude
that our mean-field results give a qualitatively correct description of the
phase transition in $NaV_2O_5$, while a more sophisticated analysis is
warranted in order to take into account the thermal fluctuations and, probably,
the proximity of the IMTF quantum critical point.

$B\to\rho\rho$, once an angular analysis is used to separate transversity
modes. The present bound on the shift of $S_{\rho^+\rho^-}$ from the true
$\sin2\alpha$ is already stronger than it is for $S_{\pi^+\pi^-}$. We point out
a subtle violation of the isospin relations when the two $\rho$ mesons are
observed with different invariant masses, and how to constrain this effect
experimentally.

stage of expansion is driven by ""old"" false vacuum inflation. This ends by
nucleation of a bubble, which then further inflates. Unlike the standard
slow-roll scenarios the ""clock"" ending the second inflationary phase is not a
local order parameter, but rather the average value of an oscillating scalar
field, which locks the system at a saddle point of the potential in a temporary
inflationary state. Inflation ends when the amplitude drops below a certain
critical point and liberates the system from the false vacuum state. The second
stage of inflation has only about 50 e-foldings, a number which is determined
entirely by the ratio of the fundamental mass scales, such as the Planck/string
scale and the supersymmetry breaking scale. The density perturbations are
generated due to fluctuations of moduli-dependent Yukawa couplings. In this
note we explore the observable imprints in the fluctuation spectrum of generic
cross-couplings in the superpotential and in the Kahler potential. We show that
in the presence of generic non-renormalizable interactions in the
superpotential between the fluctuating modulus and the oscillating inflaton,
the amplitude of the density perturbations is exponentially cut-off for
sufficiently large wavelengths. With reasonable choices of scales and
interactions, this long wavelength cutoff can occur at approximately the
current horizon size. The perturbative corrections in the K\""ahler potential
give non-trivial potentially observable tilt and a running of the spectral
index which is different from the standard inflationary models.

coincides with free heavy quark propagator up to terms of order $1/m_Q^3$,

from lattice data by means of the maximum entropy method (MEM). Our model has
two parameters which are used to fix the magnitude and position of the large

a satisfactory fit to the width of the peak. The model then also reproduces the
energy of a second peak seen in the spectral functions. In the case of the
pseudoscalar spectral function, the calculated peak is about 20 percent higher
than that found for the spectral function obtained from the lattice data.
However, it appears that the second peak is a lattice artifact [ P. Petreczky,

We conclude that the NJL model may have a broader range of application than
previously considered to be the case, if one allows for significant temperature
dependence of the parameters of the model, as well as rather large values of
the momentum cutoff parameter. Our treatment of temperature-dependent coupling

composite operators in the N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory are
studied in the one-instanton sector. Independent sets of scalar operators of
bare dimension 2, 3, 4 and 5 are constructed in all the allowed representations
of the SU(4) R-symmetry group and their two-point functions are computed in the
semiclassical approximation. Analysing the moduli space integrals the sectors
in which the scaling dimensions receive non-perturbative contributions are
identified. The requirement that the integrations over the fermionic collective
coordinates which arise in the instanton background are saturated leads to
non-renormalisation properties for a large class of operators.
Instanton-induced corrections to the scaling dimensions are found only for
dimension 4 SU(4) singlets and for dimension 5 operators in the representation
[0,1,0] of SU(4). In many cases the non-renormalisation results are argued to
be specific to operators of small dimension, but for some special sectors it is
shown that they are valid for arbitrary dimension. Comments are also made on
the implications of the results on the form of the instanton contributions to
the dilation operator of the theory and on the possibility of realising its
action on the instanton moduli space.

holographically in terms of the N=4 topological string (or the N=2 string) on
the transverse part of the near-horizon geometry of NS5-branes. We show that
this topological string can be used to efficiently compute the half-BPS F^4
terms in the low-energy effective action of the LST. Using the strong-weak
coupling string duality relating type IIA strings on K3 and heterotic strings
on T^4, the same terms may also be computed in the heterotic string near a
point of enhanced gauge symmetry. We study the F^4 terms in the heterotic
string and in the LST, and show that they have the same structure, and that
they agree in the cases for which we compute both of them. We also clarify some
additional issues, such as the definition and role of normalizable modes in
holographic linear dilaton backgrounds, the precise identifications of vertex
operators in these backgrounds with states and operators in the supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory that arises in the low energy limit of LST, and the

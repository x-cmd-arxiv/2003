quiescence and in outburst in order to identify its central accreting object.
The quiescence spectrum of CI Cam consists of soft and hard components which
are separated clearly at aound 2-3keV. A large equivalent width of an iron Ka
emission line prefers an optically thin thermal plasma emission model to a
non-thermal power-law model for the hard component, which favors a white dwarf
as the accreting object, since the optically thin thermal hard X-ray emission
is a common characteristic among cataclysmic variables (binaries including an
accreting white dwarf).
  The outburst spectrum, on the other hand, is composed of a hard component
represented by a multi-temperature optically thin thermal plasma emission and
of an independent soft X-ray component that appears below 1 keV intermittently
on a decaying light curve of the hard component. The spectrum of the soft
component is represented well by a blackbody with the temperature of
0.07-0.12keV overlaid with several K-edges associated with highly ionized
oxygen. This, together with the luminosity as high as ~1E38 erg/s is similar to
a super-soft source (SSS). The outburst in the hard X-ray band followed by the
appearance of the soft blackbody component reminds us of recent observations of
novae in outburst. We thus assume the outburst of CI Cam is that of a nova, and
obtain the distance to CI Cam to be 5-17kpc by means of the relation between
the optical decay time and the absolute magnitude. This agrees well with a
recent estimate of the distance of 5-9kpc in the optical band. All of these
results from the outburst data prefer a white dwarf for the central object of
CI Cam.

bright ultraluminous X-ray source M81 X-9 (Holmberg IX X-1), obtained in
snapshot observations. Soft thermal emission is clearly revealed in spectra
dominated by hard power-law components. Depending on the model used, M81 X-9
was observed at a luminosity of L_X = 1.0-1.6 E+40 erg/s (0.3--10.0 keV). The
variability previously observed in this source signals that it is an accreting
source which likely harbors a black hole. Remarkably, accretion disk models for
the soft thermal emission yield very low inner disk temperatures (kT =
0.17-0.29 keV, including 90% confidence errors and variations between
observations and disk models), and improve the fit statistic over any
single-component continuum model at the 6 sigma level of confidence. Like NGC
1313 X-1, scaling the temperatures measured in M81 X-9 to those commonly seen
in stellar-mass Galactic black holes at their highest observed fluxes (kT ~ 1
keV) may imply that M81 X-9 harbors a black hole with a mass on the order of
10^3 Msun; the measured disk component normalization and broad-band luminosity
imply black hole masses on the order of 10^2 Msun. It is therefore possible
that these sources harbor 10^3 Msun black holes accreting such at L_X ~
0.1*L_Edd. Radio and optical observations suggest that beaming and anisotropic
emission from a stellar-mass black hole are unlikely to account for the implied
luminosity. We further argue that the strength of the hard emission in these
sources and well-established phenomena frequently observed in stellar-mass
black holes near to the Eddington limit suggest that optically-thick
photospheres are unlikely to be the origin of the cool thermal emission in
bright ULXs.

a dwarf spheroidal galaxy companion to M31, using HST/WFPC2 observations.
Seventy-three variables were found, one of which is an anomalous Cepheid while
the others are RR Lyrae stars. The anomalous Cepheid has properties consistent
with those found in other dwarf spheroidal galaxies. For the RR Lyrae stars,
the mean periods are 0.571 day and 0.363 day for the fundamental mode and
first-overtone mode stars, respectively. With this fundamental mode mean period
and the mean metallicity determined from the red giant branch (<[Fe/H]>=-1.49),
Andromeda II follows the period-metallicity relation defined by the Galactic
globular clusters and other dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We also find that the
properties of the RR Lyrae stars themselves indicate a mean abundance that is
consistent with that determined from the red giants. There is, however, a
significant spread among the RR Lyrae stars in the period-amplitude diagram,
which is possibly related to the metallicity spread in Andromeda II indicated
by the width of the red giant branch in Da Costa et al. In addition, the
abundance distribution of the RR Lyrae stars is notably wider than the
distribution expected from the abundance determination errors alone. The mean
magnitude of the RR Lyrae stars, <V_RR>=24.87+/-0.03, implies a distance
d=665+/-20 kpc to Andromeda II. We also demonstrate that the specific frequency
of anomalous Cepheids in dwarf spheroidal galaxies correlates with the mean
metallicity of their parent galaxy, and that the Andromeda II and Andromeda VI
anomalous Cepheids appear to follow the same relation as those in the Galactic
dwarf spheroidals.

without further fragmentation. Here we show that as soon as the primordial gas

abundance as small as ~0.01-0.1% of that found in the Sun, cooling by
singly-ionized carbon or neutral oxygen can lead to the formation of low-mass
stars. This mechanism naturally accommodates the discovery of solar mass stars
with unusually low (10^{-5.3} of the solar value) iron abundance but with a
high (10^{-1.3} solar) carbon abundance. The minimum stellar mass at early

channel approach unifies resonant and non-resonant phenomena, and enables a
general and self-consistent treatment of photoionization and electron-ion
recombination employing idential wavefunction expansion. Detailed balance takes
account of interference effects due to resonances in cross sections, calculated
explicitly for a large number of recombined (e+ion) bound levels over extended
energy regions. The theory of DR by Bell and Seaton is adapted for high-n
resonances in the region below series limits. The R-matrix method is employed
for (A) partial and total photoionization and photorecombination cross sections
of (e+ion) bound levels, and (B) DR and (e+ion) scattering cross sections.
Relativistic effects and fine structure are considered in the Breit-Pauli
approximation. Effects such as radiation damping may be taken into account
where necessary. Unfiied recombination cross sections are in excellent
agreement with measurements on ion storage rings to about 10-20%. In addition
to high accuracy, the strengths of the method are: (I) both total and
level-specific cross sections and rate coefficients are obtained, and (II) a
single (e+ion) recombination rate coefficient for any given atom or ion is
obtained over the entire temperature range of practical importance in
laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, (III) self-consistent results are
obtained for photoionization and recombination; comprehensive datasets have
been computed for over 50 atoms and ions. Selected data are presented for iron

can account for the observations and that the [OI] 146um emission is the best

that the [SiII] emission originates mostly from the ionized gas. The [SiII]

investigated as to the possibility to distinguish between these two galaxy

elliptical and starburst galaxies at redshifts up to 5 are computed from
synthetic spectra obtained using the spectral evolution synthesis programme

considered, the evolution of the R-K colour sets the requirement that
ellipticals have to be less than 7-8 Gyr old, and that the starbursts must have
colour excesses of E(B-V)>1, as derived from the nebular emission lines. In
investigating the overlap in the different colour-colour planes as a function
of redshift, it is found that the planes formed from permutations of the same
three filters exhibit very similar overlap characteristics. In colour-colour
planes formed within such triplets one of the filters will serve as a ""pivot""
band against which the two other bands are compared. The configuration where
this pivot band lies between the other two bands has the best performance as a
discriminator among the three possible configurations. A consistent behaviour
cannot be found among the configurations formed by permuting four filters. The
minimal filter configuration R-H vs. H-K is found to be the very best

excited in the hot, dense infalling gas after the accretion shock, although
this cannot explain all the H2O emission. An accretion shock nature for the
continuum emission seems unlikely.

group of galaxies around the field elliptical NGC 1490. The HII regions are
located at least 100 kpc from any optical galaxy but are associated with a
number of large HI clouds that are lying along an arc 500 kpc in length and
that have no optical counterpart on the Digital Sky Survey. The sum of the HI
masses of the clouds is almost 10^10 M_sun and the largest HI cloud is about
100 kpc in size. Deep optical imaging reveals a very low surface brightness
counterpart to this largest HI cloud, making this one of the HI richest optical
galaxies known (M_HI/L_V~200). Spectroscopy of the HII regions indicates that
the abundance in these HII regions is only slightly sub-solar, excluding a
primordial origin of the HI clouds. The HI clouds are perhaps remnants
resulting from the tidal disruption of a reasonably sized galaxy, probably
quite some time ago, by the loose group to which NGC1490 belongs.
Alternatively, they are remnants of the merger that created the field
elliptical NGC1490. The isolated HII regions show that star formation on a very
small scale can occur in intergalactic space in gas drawn from galaxies by
tidal interactions. Many such intergalactic small star formation regions may
exist near tidally interacting galaxies.

extracted from fully cosmological simulations and correspond in mass to the

decrease by a factor 4-10 from z~1 to z~0, reflecting the decrease in the rate
at which hot halo gas cools out on to the disc. At all redshifts, most of the
emission is found to originate within 10-15 kpc of the disc. When combined with
models in which the evolution of disc X-ray luminosity is dominated by X-ray
binaries, the predicted halo luminosities at z~1 show good agreement with
constraints from spiral galaxies in Chandra Deep Field data. There is an
indication that haloes with a metal abundance of 0.3 solar overpredict observed
X-ray luminosities at z~1, suggesting that halo metallicities are lower than
this value. Prospects for direct detection of the haloes of Milky Way-sized
galaxies with current and future X-ray instrumentation are discussed. It is
found that XEUS should be able to single out the halo emission of highly
inclined Milky Way-sized disc galaxies out to approximately z=0.3. For such
galaxies in this redshift interval, we estimate a lower limit to the surface
density of detectable haloes on the sky of ~10 deg^(-2). More generally, owing
to their luminosity evolution, the optimum redshifts at which to observe such
haloes could be 0.5<z<1, depending on their assembly history.

different locations in the halo of NGC 5128 with the ISAAC near-IR array on ESO
VLT. From more than 20 hours of observations with ISAAC a very deep Ks-band
luminosity function was constructed. The tip of the RGB is detected at Ks=21.24
\pm 0.05 mag. Using an empirical calibration of the K-band RGB tip magnitude,
and assuming a mean metallicity of [M/H]=-0.4 dex and reddening of E(B-V)=0.11,
a distance modulus of NGC 5128 of (m-M)_0=27.87 \pm 0.16 was derived. The
comparison of the H-band RGB tip magnitude in NGC 5128 and the Galactic Bulge
implies a distance modulus of NGC 5128 of (m-M)_0=27.9 \pm 0.2 in good
agreement with the K-band RGB tip measurement. The population of stars above
the tip of the RGB amounts to 2176 stars in the outer halo field and 6072 stars
in the inner halo field. The large majority of these sources belong to the
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) population in NGC 5128 with numerous long period
variables. Mira variables were used to determine the distance of NGC 5128 from
a period-luminosity relation calibrated using the Hipparcos parallaxes and LMC
Mira period-luminosity relation in the K-band. This is the first Mira
period-luminosity relation outside the Local Group. A distance modulus of 27.96
\pm 0.11 was derived, adopting the LMC distance modulus of 18.50 \pm 0.04. The
mean of the two methods yields a distance modulus to NGC 5128 of 27.92 \pm 0.19

softer and harder X-rays. The hard photons seem to arrive up to a few ms after
the soft for a given Fourier frequency of the perturbation. The energy
dependence of the time lags has a roughly logarithmic behavior. Up to now most
theories fail to explain the observed magnitude and Fourier frequency
dependence of the lags or fail other statistical tests. We show that the time
lags can arise from a simple pivoting power law model, which creates the
logarithmic dependence on the photon energy at once. A pivoting power law
arises naturally from jet/synchrotron models for the X-ray emission, but may
also be applicable to corona models. A hint to the coherence features of the
light-curves can be obtained from the power spectral density, which can be
decomposed into a few broad Lorentzians that could arise from a couple of
strongly damped oscillators with low quality factors below one. Using small
variations of the power law index for each Lorentzian separately the lags can
be derived analytically. They show the correct Fourier frequency dependence of
the time lags. If one assumes variations of the power law index by +- 0.2 the
model can account for the observed magnitude of the time lags in Cyg X-1. As a
further test we calculated the cross- and auto-correlation functions for our
model, which also show qualitatively the observed behavior. The coherence
function for the model is in agreement with the observed data in the Fourier
regime, where the model is valid.

corresponding to shareholdings. In this framework, the in-degree ($k_{in}$) and
the sum of incoming link weights ($v$) of an investor correspond to the number
of assets held (\emph{portfolio diversification}) and to the invested wealth
(\emph{portfolio volume}) respectively. An empirical analysis of three
different real markets reveals that the distributions of both $k_{in}$ and $v$
display power-law tails with exponents $\gamma$ and $\alpha$. Moreover, we find
that $k_{in}$ scales as a power-law function of $v$ with an exponent $\beta$.
Remarkably, despite the values of $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ differ across
the three markets, they are always governed by the scaling relation
$\beta=(1-\alpha)/(1-\gamma)$. We show that these empirical findings can be

links grow in time in a non-linear fashion. We consider growing networks in
which the number of outgoing links is a non-linear function of time but new
links between older nodes are forbidden. The attachments are made using a
preferential attachment scheme. In the deterministic picture, the number of
outgoing links $m(t)$ at any time $t$ is taken as $N(t)^\theta$ where $N(t)$ is
the number of nodes present at that time. The continuum theory predicts a power
law decay of the degree distribution: $P(k) \propto k^{-1-\frac{2}
{1-\theta}}$, while the degree of the node introduced at time $t_i$ is given by
$k(t_i,t) = t_i^{\theta}[ \frac {t}{t_i}]^{\frac {1+\theta}{2}}$ when the
network is evolved till time $t$. Numerical results show a growth in the degree
distribution for small $k$ values at any non-zero $\theta$. In the stochastic
picture, $m(t)$ is a random variable. As long as $<m(t)>$ is independent of
time, the network shows a behaviour similar to the Barab\'asi-Albert (BA)
model. Different results are obtained when $<m(t) >$ is time-dependent, e.g.,
when $m(t)$ follows a distribution $P(m) \propto m^{-\lambda}$. The behaviour
of $P(k)$ changes significantly as $\lambda$ is varied: for $\lambda > 3$, the
network has a scale-free distribution belonging to the BA class as predicted by
the mean field theory, for smaller values of $\lambda$ it shows different
behaviour. Characteristic features of the clustering coefficients in both

dynamics of the number of monomers s on one side of the membrane, assuming that
the two segments are in equilibrium. The dynamics of s(t) in such a limit would
be diffusive, with a mean translocation time scaling as N^2 in the absence of a
force, and proportional to N when a force is applied. We demonstrate that the
assumption of equilibrium must break down for sufficiently long polymers (more
easily when forced), and provide lower bounds for the translocation time by
comparison to unimpeded motion of the polymer. These lower bounds exceed the
time scales calculated on the basis of equilibrium, and point to anomalous
(sub-diffusive) character of translocation dynamics. This is explicitly
verified by numerical simulations of the unforced translocation of a
self-avoiding polymer. Forced translocation times are shown to strongly depend
on the method by which the force is applied. In particular, pulling the polymer
by the end leads to much longer times than when a chemical potential difference
is applied across the membrane. The bounds in these cases grow as N^2 and
N^{1+\nu}, respectively, where \nu is the exponent that relates the scaling of
the radius of gyration to N. Our simulations demonstrate that the actual
translocation times scale in the same manner as the bounds, although influenced
by strong finite size effects which persist even for the longest polymers that
we considered (N=512).

more slowly than previously thought. This analysis is in good agreement with
simulation data which are available for a moderate size ratio of 10. Small
discrepancies to results from density functional theory (DFT) at this size
ratio become amplified for larger size ratios. Therefore we have improved upon
previous DFT techniques by imposing test particle consistency which connects
DFT to integral equations. However, the improved results show no convergence

trace and how to produce this trace. On the one hand, trace designs are too
often guided by implementation concerns and are not as useful as they should
be. On the other hand, an interesting trace which cannot be produced
efficiently, is not very useful either. In this article we propose a
methodology which helps to efficiently produce accurate traces. Firstly, design
a formal specification of the trace model. Secondly, derive a prototype tracer
from this specification. Thirdly, analyze the produced traces. Fourthly,
implement an efficient tracer. Lastly, compare the traces of the two tracers.
At each step, problems can be found. In that case one has to iterate the
process. We have successfully applied the proposed methodology to the design
and implementation of a real tracer for constraint logic programming which is
able to efficiently generate information required to build interesting
graphical views of executions.

Standard Model degrees of freedom live in a $4+n$ dimensional brane, with $n$
compact and small extra spatial dimensions. In these models, the simplest way
to obtain the conventional 4-dimensional Planck scale starting with a low
string scale is to have also some larger extra dimensions, where only gravity
propagates. In such theories, dimensional reduction generically leads to at
least two radion fields, one associated with the total volume of the extra
spatial dimensions, and the other with the ratio of the sizes of small and
large extra dimensions. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the radion
fields on cosmology. We emphasize various aspects of radion physics such as
radion coupling to the Standard Model fields, bare and dressed radion masses
during inflation, dynamical stabilization of radions during and after
inflation, radion decay life time and its late dominance in thermal history of
the Universe as well as its quantum fluctuations during inflation. We argue
that models where the radion plays the role of an inflaton or the inflaton is a
brane scalar field, run into problems. We then present a successful inflation
model with bulk scalar fields that seems to have all the desired properties. We
also briefly discuss the possibility of radion as a cold dark matter candidate.

detecting solar electron antineutrinos produced by solar core and convective
magnetic fields. These antineutrinos are predicted by spin-flavor oscillations

SNP. Using the recent Kamland results and assuming a concrete model for
antineutrino production by spin-flavor precession in the convective zone based
on chaotic magnetic fields,we obtain bounds on the flux of solar antineutrinos,
on the average conversion neutrino-antineutrino probability and on intrinsic
neutrino magnetic moment. In the most conservative case, $\mu\lsim 2.5\times
10^{-11} \mu_B$ (95% CL). When studying the effects of a core magnetic field,
we find in the weak limit a scaling of the antineutrino probability with
respect to the magnetic field profile in the sense that the same probability
function can be reproduced by any profile with a suitable peak field value. In
this way the solar electron antineutrino spectrum can be unambiguosly
predicted. We use this scaling and the negative results indicated by the
KamLAND experiment to obtain upper bounds on the solar electron antineutrino
flux. We find that, for a wide family of magnetic field profiles in the sun
interior, the antineutrino appearance probability is largely determined by the
magnetic field intensity but not by its shape. Explicit limits on neutrino
transition moments are also obtained consistent with the convective case. These
limits are therefore largerly independent of the detailed structure of the
magnetic field in the solar interior.

Under the
assumtion that the deviation from equillibrium was large, in particular that it
is higher than the scale of inflation, we analyse the conditions for local
transitions between states that are related to different vacua. All pathways
lead to an attractor solution of a description of the universe by eternal
inflation with domains that have different low energy parameters. The generic
case favors transitions between states that have significantly different
parameters rather than jumps between nearby states in parameter space. I argue
that the strong CP problem presents a potential difficulty for this picture,
more difficult than the hierarchy problem or the cosmological constant problem.
Finally, I describe how the spectrum of quark masses may be a probe of the
early dynamics of vacuum states. As an example, by specializing to the case of
intersecting braneworld models, I show that the observed mass spectrum, which
is approximately scale invariant, corresponds to a flat distribution in the
intersection area of the branes, with a maximum area A_max ~ 100 alpha'.

including two channels. Using the VA technique, conditions for stable
propagation of the antisymmetric dispersion-managed (ASDM) solitons in one
channel are found, and complete and incomplete collisions between the solitons
belonging to the different channels are investigated. In particular, it is
shown that formation of a bound inter-channel state of two ASDM solitons is
possible under certain conditions (but may be easily avoided). The VA
predictions for the single- and two-channel systems are compared with direct
simulations of the underlying partial differential equations. In most cases,
the agreement is very good, but in some cases (very closely spaced channels)
the collision may destroy the ASDM solitons. The timing-jitter suppression
factor (JSF) for the ASDM soliton in one channel, and the crosstalk timing
jitter induced by collision between the solitons belonging to the different
channels are also estimated analytically. In particular, the JSF for the ASDM
soliton may be much larger than for its fundamental-soliton counterpart in the

using trajectories of poles of the scattering amplitude in the complex angular

paper consists in showing that also the antiresonances (or echoes) can be
described by trajectories of the scattering amplitude poles, instead of using
the hard-sphere potential scattering as prescribed by the classical
Breit-Wigner theory. The antiresonance poles lie in the fourth quadrant of the
complex angular momentum plane, and are associated with non-local potentials
which take into account the exchange forces; it derives a clear-cut separation
between resonance and antiresonance poles. The evolution of these latter poles
describes the passage from quantum to semi-classical physics. The theory is
tested on the rotational band produced by $\alpha$-$\alpha$ elastic scattering
and on the hadronic rotational bands in $\pi^+$-p elastic scattering.

perturbations with flexibility allowing their constituents to assume new roles

proteins is a major force shaping molecular networks in living organisms.
Recent availability of system-wide data for yeast S. Cerevisiae allow us to
access the effects of gene duplication on robustness and plasticity of
molecular networks. We demonstrate that the upstream transcriptional regulation
of duplicated genes diverges fast, losing on average 4% of their common
transcription factors for every 1% divergence of their amino acid sequences. In
contrast, the set of physical interaction partners of their protein products
changes much slower. The relative stability of downstream functions of
duplicated genes, is further corroborated by their ability to substitute for
each other in gene knockout experiments. We believe that the combination of the
upstream plasticity and the downstream robustness is a general feature
determining the evolvability of molecular networks.

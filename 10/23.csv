F606W and F814W filters were taken in 2001 with the WFPC2 on board the HST. A
first published analysis of this data set (Richer et al. 2002) produced the
result that the age of M4 is 12.7 +/- 0.7 Gyr (Hansen et al. 2002), thus
setting a robust lower limit to the age of the universe. In view of the great
astronomical importance of getting this number right, we have subjected the
same data set to the simplest possible photometric analysis that completely
avoids uncertain assumptions about the origin of the detected sources. This
analysis clearly reveals both a thin main sequence, from which can be deduced
the deepest statistically complete mass function yet determined for a globular
cluster, and a white dwarf (WD) sequence extending all the way down to the 5
sigma detection limit at I~27. The WD sequence is abruptly terminated at
exactly this limit as expected by detection statistics. Using our most recent
theoretical WD models (Prada Moroni & Straniero 2002) to obtain the expected WD
sequence for different ages in the observed bandpasses, we find that the data
so far obtained do not reach the peak of the WD luminosity function, thence
only allowing one to set a lower limit to the age of M4 of ~9 Gyr. Thus, the
problem of determining the absolute age of a globular cluster and, therefore,
the onset of GC formation with cosmologically significant accuracy remains
completely open. Only observations several magnitudes deeper than the limit
obtained so far would allow one to approach this objective.

their velocity dispersion tensors more isotropic. The rate of mass loss depends

towards higher AGN bolometric contributions than sub-mm-selected galaxies due
to the 60 micron selection of some, so the location on the K-z relation may be

analyzing the statistics of SiIV, CIV, and HI pixel optical depths in a sample

which we compare to realistic spectra drawn from a hydrodynamical simulation.
We find that silicon is highly overabundant relative to carbon and that the
scatter in Si/C is much smaller than that in C/H, implying a common origin for
Si and C. The inferred [Si/C] depends upon the shape of the UV background (UVB)
(harder backgrounds leading to higher [Si/C]), ranging from [Si/C] ~ 1.5 for a
quasar-only UVB, to [Si/C] ~ 0.25 for a UVB including both galaxies and an
artificial softening. For our fiducial UVB, which includes both quasars and
galaxies, we find [Si/C]=0.77 +/- 0.05, with a possible systematic error of ~
0.1 dex. There is no evidence for evolution in [Si/C] and the data are
inconsistent with previous claims of a sharp change in the SiIV/CIV ratio (or
the UVB) at z ~ 3. Comparisons with low-metallicity halo stars and
nucleosynthetic yields suggest that either our fiducial UVB is too hard or that
supermassive Pop III stars might have to be included. The inferred [Si/C]
corresponds to a contribution to the cosmic Si abundance of [Si/H] = -2.0, a
significant fraction of all Si production expected by z ~ 3.

serendipitously discovered on 2003 July 15 by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer

5.54 s spin-period and a soft spectrum (photon index ~ 4). We detect the source
in earlier RXTE observations back to 2003 January. These show that a transient
outburst began between 2002 November 17 and 2003 January 23 and that the pulsar
has been spinning down since then, with a high rate Pdot ~ 10^-11 s/s showing
significant timing noise, but no evidence for Doppler shifts due to a binary
companion. The rapid spin-down rate and slow spin-period imply a super-critical
magnetic field B=3x10^14 G and a young characteristic age < 7600 yr. These
properties are strikingly similar to those of anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft
gamma repeaters, making the source a likely new magnetar. A follow-up Chandra
observation provided a 2"".5 radius error circle within which the 1.5 m
Russian-Turkish Optical Telescope RTT150 found a limiting magnitude of
R_c=21.5, in accord with other recently reported limits. The source is present
in archival ASCA and ROSAT data as well, at a level 100 times fainter than the

currently in a state similar to the inactive phase of XTE J1810-197 may also be
unidentified magnetars awaiting detection via a similar activity.

protons and ions into the interstellar medium of star-forming
galaxies--including the Milky Way--with a power law spectrum extending to a
maximum energy ~10^20 eV. The CR spectrum near the knee is fit with CRs trapped
in the Galactic halo that were accelerated and injected by an earlier Galactic
GRB. These CRs diffuse in the disk and halo of the Galaxy due to gyroresonant
pitch-angle scattering with MHD turbulence in the Galaxy's magnetic field. The
preliminary (2001) KASCADE data through the knee of the CR spectrum are fit by
a model with energy-dependent propagation of CR ions from a single Galactic
GRB. Ultra-high energy CRs (UHECRs), with energies above the ankle are assumed
to propagate rectilinearly with their spectrum modified by photo-pion,
photo-pair, and expansion losses. We fit the measured UHECR spectrum assuming
comoving luminosity densities of GRB sources consitent with possible star
formation rate histories of the universe. For power-law CR proton injection p>2
this model implies that the nonthermal content in the GRB blast waves is
hadronically dominated by a factor ~60-200. Calculations show that 100 TeV-100
PeV neutrinos could be detected several times per year from all GRBs in
kilometer-scale neutrino detectors such as IceCube, for GRB blast-wave Doppler
factors <~200. GLAST measurements of gamma-ray components and cutoffs will
constrain the product of nonthermal baryon loading and radiative efficiency,
limit the Doppler factor, and test this senario.

GCs as a reference for the apparently universal old metal-poor GC populations
and assuming their intrinsic widths to be constant in time at the values of the
Milky Way halo GC populations, I study for which combinations of age and
metallicity a secondary GC population formed in some violent star formation
event in the history of a galaxy may or may not be detected in the observed GC
color distributions and LFs (U- through K-bands). Significant differences are

perfectly hide within one inconspicuous optical color peak. If, and only if,
some broad age -- metallicity relation is assumed, as expected e.g. for
secondary GCs forming in spiral galaxy mergers from a pre-enriched ISM, models
indicate single-peak GC LFs even in GC systems with bimodal color
distributions. We point out the importance of having multi-band information
(including NIR) to independently constrain ages and metallicities of GC
subpopulations that will shed light on both cluster and galaxy formation
scenarios. Models presented here are being used for the interpretation of

combination of hydrodynamic simulations and N-body orbit integrations to study
the long term evolution of a fragmenting disc with an initial mass ratio to the
star of M_disc/M_star = 0.1. For a disc which is initially unstable across a
range of radii, a combination of collapse and subsequent accretion yields
substellar objects with a spectrum of masses extending (for a Solar mass star)
up to ~0.01 M_sun. Subsequent gravitational evolution ejects most of the lower
mass objects within a few million years, leaving a small number of very massive
planets or brown dwarfs in eccentric orbits at moderately small radii. Based on
these results, systems such as HD 168443 -- in which the companions are close

have formed via gravitational instability. If massive substellar companions
originate from disc fragmentation, while lower-mass planetary companions
originate from core accretion, the metallicity distribution of stars which host
massive substellar companions at radii of ~1 au should differ from that of

spectrum is flat at the shock and steep in the interior of the remnant. NH is
well correlated with the X-ray brightness. A strong NH is found in the
southwest rim of RX J1713.7-3946. We suggest that the SNR is interacting with a
HI region there.

this paper, we discuss the global proper motion of the SiO maser emission as a
function of pulsation phase. We measure a dominant expansion mode between
optical phases $\phi \sim 0.7-1.5$ confirming ballistic deceleration, and
compare this to predictions from existing pulsation models for late-type,
evolved stars. Local infall and outflow motions are superimposed on the
dominant expansion mode, and non-radial local gas motions are also evident for
individual SiO maser components. The overall morphology and evolution of the
SiO emission deviates significantly from spherical symmetry, with important
implications for models of pulsation kinematics in the near-circumstellar
environments of Mira variables.

emission-line images are generally consistent with each other and the radial
profiles show that the Si K emission extends to a larger radius than the Fe L
emission (distinctly in the southern part of the remnant). Therefore, in
contrast to Cas A, no inversion of the Si- and Fe-rich ejecta layers is
observed in Kepler. Moreover, the Fe K emission peaks at a smaller radius than
the Fe L emission, which implies that the temperature increases inwards in the
ejecta. The 4-6 keV high energy continuum map shows the same distribution as
the asymmetric emission-line images except in the southeast where there is a
strong additional emission. A two color image of the 4-6 keV and 8-10 keV high
energy continuum illustrates that the hardness variations of the continuum are
weak all along the remnant except in a few knots. The asymmetry in the Fe K
emission-line is not associated with any asymmetry in the Fe K equivalent width
map. The Si K maps lead to the same conclusions. Hence, abundance variations do
not cause the north-south brightness asymmetry. The strong emission in the
north may be due to overdensities in the circumstellar medium. In the
southeastern region of the remnant, the lines have a very low equivalent width
and the X-ray emission is largely nonthermal.

the system is in the ESF state which breaks the internal $ U(1) $ symmetry,
when $ d_{c1} < d < d_{c2} $, the system is in an Pseudo-spin density wave
(PSDW) state which breaks the translational symmetry, there is a first order
transition at $ d_{c1} $ driven by the collapsing of magneto-roton minimum at a

nanoparticles (of radius 50 nm or less) which are bound together by links made
up of DNA strands. In our structural model, the nanocomposite forms from a
series of Monte Carlo steps, each involving reaction-limited cluster-cluster
aggregation (RLCA) followed by dehybridization of the DNA links. These links
form with a probability $p_{eff}$ which depends on temperature and particle
radius $a$. The final structure depends on the number of monomers (i. e. gold

modes in uniaxially anisotropic nematic liquids as described by the five
parametric Leslie-Ericksen-Parodi (LEP) constitutive equations (CEs). As in the
similar elastic case, the soft dissipative modes theoretically cause no
resistance to flow, nullifying the corresponding components of viscous part of
stress tensor, and do not contribute in the dissipation. Similarly to the
theories of nematic elastic solids, this effect is caused by a marginal
thermodynamic stability. The analysis is trivialized in a specific rotating
orthogonal coordinate system whose one axis is directed along the director. We
demonstrate that depending on closeness of material parameters to the marginal
stability conditions, LEP CEs describe the entire variety of soft, semi-soft
and harder behaviours of nematic viscous liquids. When the only shearing
dissipative modes are soft, the viscous part of stress tensor is symmetric, and
LEP CE for stress, scaled with isotropic viscosity is reduced to a
one-parametric, stress - strain rate anisotropic relation. When additionally
the elongation dissipative mode is also soft, this scaled relation has no
additional parameters and shows that the dissipation is always less than that

development of plastic strain. Also macroscopic observables as plastic work and
porosity have been computed from the atomistic level. The stress thresholds for

the dynamical equations in the steady-state, we derive exact analytical

different surface roughnesses and surface impurities obtained by surface

We discuss a class of utility functions that stems from the axioms of utility

between cumulative probability distributions and normalized utility functions.
Based on this analogy, a utility density function can de defined as the
derivative of a normalized utility function. A utility density function is
non-negative and integrates to unity. These two properties form the basis of a
correspondence between utility and probability. A natural application of this
analogy is a maximum entropy principle to assign maximum entropy utility
values. Maximum entropy utility interprets many of the common utility functions
based on the preference information needed for their assignment, and helps
assign utility values based on partial preference information. This paper
reviews maximum entropy utility and introduces further results that stem from
the duality between probability and utility.

D69 (2004) 083510","10.1103/PhysRevD.69.083510",,"hep-th astro-ph gr-qc hep-ph",,"  Nucleation of branes by a four-form field has recently been considered in
string motivated scenarios for the neutralization of the cosmological constant.
An interesting question in this context is whether the nucleation of stacks of
coincident branes is possible, and if so, at what rate does it proceed. Feng et
al. have suggested that, at high ambient de Sitter temperature, the rate may be
strongly enhanced, due to large degeneracy factors associated with the number
of light species living on the worldsheet. This might facilitate the quick
relaxation from a large effective cosmological constant down to the observed
value. Here, we analyse this possibility in some detail. In four dimensions,
and after the moduli are stabilized, branes interact via repulsive long range
forces. Because of that, the Coleman-de Luccia (CdL) instanton for coincident
brane nucleation may not exist, unless there is some short range interaction
which keeps the branes together. If the CdL instanton exists, we find that the
degeneracy factor depends only mildly on the ambient de Sitter temperature, and
does not switch off even in the case of tunneling from flat space. This would
result in catastrophic decay of the present vacuum. If, on the contrary, the
CdL instanton does not exist, coindident brane nucleation may still proceed
through a ""static"" instanton, representing pair creation of critical bubbles --
a process somewhat analogous to thermal activation in flat space. In that case,
the branes may stick together due to thermal symmetry restoration, and the pair
creation rate depends exponentially on the ambient de Sitter temperature,
switching off sharply as the temperature approaches zero. Such static instanton
may be well suited for the ""saltatory"" relaxation scenario proposed by Feng et
al.

discuss the origin of the extra constraint which the field function has to

of constraint plus dynamical equation of motion can be obtained by a suitable
reduction of a noncommutative version of 4d self-dual Yang-Mills theory. The
field equations can be derived from an action which is the sum of two WZNW
actions with cosine potentials corresponding to a complexified noncommutative
U(1) gauge group. A brief discussion of the relation with the bosonized

$\kappa$--supersymmetric to all orders. Our method was based on an extension of
target superspace to $\mathrm{N} \times \mathrm{N}$ matrix--valued objects for
all the items appearing in the geometric construction. Then we applied the
\textit{double first order formalism} introduced by us in the previous
construction of abelian brane actions to the non--abelian case and we claimed
that the Bosonic action given by the prescription of the \textit{symmetrized
trace} could be promoted to a fully kappa supersymmetric one. Unfortunately
there is an internal inconsistency, relative to U(N) gauge invariance in the
matricisation of target superspace geometry and there is a subtle inconsistency
in the variation of the symmetric trace action due to the loss of associativity
of the underlying symmetrized product. Because of that the entire construction
previously submitted does not stand on its feet. Consequently the present
resubmission is done in order to disclaim our previously claimed result and
also to express our sincere gratitude to our friends Paul Howe and Ulf
Lindstrom who, with their constructive criticism and private correspondence,

this calculus, an integral of order $\alpha, 0 < \alpha \leq 1$, called
$F^\alpha$-integral, is defined, which is suitable to integrate functions with
fractal support $F$ of dimension $\alpha$. Further, a derivative of order
$\alpha, 0 < \alpha \leq 1$, called $F^\alpha$-derivative, is defined, which
enables us to differentiate functions, like the Cantor staircase, ``changing''
only on a fractal set. The $F^\alpha$-derivative is local unlike the classical
fractional derivative. The $F^\alpha$-calculus retains much of the simplicity
of ordinary calculus. Several results including analogues of fundamental
theorems of calculus are proved.
  The integral staircase function, which is a generalisation of the functions
like the Cantor staircase function, plays a key role in this formulation.
Further, it gives rise to a new definition of dimension, the
$\gamma$-dimension.
  $F^\alpha$-differential equations are equations involving
$F^\alpha$-derivatives. They can be used to model sublinear dynamical systems
and fractal time processes, since sublinear behaviours are associated with
staircase-like functions which occur naturally as their solutions. As examples,
we discuss a fractal-time diffusion equation, and one dimensional motion of a
particle undergoing friction in a fractal medium.

doing this, we also prove that extremal solitons can only exist in the

vanish, but yet, the non-semi-simplicity of our gauge group allows us to
consider a class of un-orthodox observables which breaks gauge invariance at
one point and which lead to a non-trivial theory on long knots in
$\mathbb{R}^3$. We have two main morals : 1. In the non-semi-simple case, there
is more to observe in Chern-Simons theory! There might be other interesting non

simplification of their results and enables us to generalize and solve a

We demonstrate that holomorphic functions allowing complete analytic
continuation cannot propagate any information, such that information transfer
only occurs with analytic functions having points of non-analyticity (i.e.
meromorphic functions). Such points of non-analyticity (or discontinuities) are
incompatible with adiabaticity, so that information transfer must always be
accompanied by a change in entropy: a dynamic reformulation of Landauer's
Principle. In addition, since Brillouin proved that discontinuities cannot
travel faster than the speed of light c, this also implies that information
cannot be transferred at superluminal speeds.

coregulated tend to lie next to each other on the genome. Moreover, these pairs

arrangement of operons allows the upstream regulatory regions to interfere with
each other. This affords additional regulatory control, as illustrated by a
mean-field analysis of a feed-forward loop. Our results suggest that regulatory
control can provide a selection pressure that drives operons together in the

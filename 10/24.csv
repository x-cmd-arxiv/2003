components which may be associated with the core of the submillimeter emitting
region. A radio source at the position of one of the HST components
(22:17:25.94, +00:12:38.9) identifies it as the likely counterpart to the
submillimeter source. We also tentatively detect the CO(4-3) molecular line,
centered on the radio position. We use the CO(4-3) intensity to estimate a
limit on the gas mass for the system. The optical morphology of sources within
the Ly_alpha cloud appears to be filamentary, while the optical source
identified with the radio source has a dense knot which may be an AGN or
compact starburst. We obtain a Keck-LRIS spectrum of this object, despite its
faintness (R=26.8). The spectrum reveals weak Ly_alpha emission, but no other
obvious features, suggesting that the source is not an energetic AGN (or that
it is extremely obscured). We use non-detections in deep Chandra X-ray images
to constrain the nature of the `Blob'. Although conclusive evidence regarding
the nature of the object remains hard to obtain at this redshift, the evidence
presented here is at least consistent with a dust-obscured AGN surrounded by a
starburst situated at the heart of this giant Ly_alpha cloud.

likelihood of a detection, based on a predicted number of comets similar to
that of the solar system. We find that our analytical method is able to recover
a signal and our S/N is sufficient to detect this feature in the spectral
regions on either side of the core of the D1 line, where it is most likely to
appear. No significant absorption was detected for any of the nights based on a
3 sigma detection limit. We derive upper limits on the column density of sodium
of < ~6 x 10^{9} cm^{-2} for a signal in the region around the line core and <
\~2 x 10^{10} cm^{-2} for a signal in the core of the photospheric D1 line.
These numbers are consistent with the sodium released in a single periodic

non-grey PMS tracks for Teff>4000 K. We compute several grids of evolutionary
tracks varying: 1. the treatment of convection: either the Mixing Length Theory
(MLT) or Canuto et al. (1996, CGM) treatment; 2.the atmospheric boundary
conditions: we use the new Vienna grids of ATLAS9 atmospheres (Heiter et al.
2002a), which were computed using either MLT (with alpha=Lambda/Hp=0.5) or CGM
treatments. We compute as well grids of models with the NextGen (Allard &
Hauschildt 1997) atmosphere models, and a 1 Msun grey MLT evolutionary track
using the alpha calibration based on 2D-hydrodynamical models (Ludwig et al.
1999)}. These different grids of models allow us to analyze the effects of
convection modeling on the non--grey PMS evolutionary tracks. We conclude that:
1. In spite of the solar calibration, if MLT convection is adopted a large
uncertainty results in the shape and location of PMS tracks. 2. As long as the
model of convection is not the same in the interior and in the atmosphere the
optical depth at which we take the boundary conditions is an additional
parameter of the models. 3. The comparison between NextGen and ATLAS9 based
models shows that, in the Teff domain they have in common (4000--10000K), the
PMS location is mainly determined by the treatment of the over-adiabatic
convection. 4. Comparison with observations indicates that, for any convection
model and for any of the atmosphere grids, convection in the PMS phase appears
to be less efficient than what is necessary in order to fit the Sun.

feature form only in FRII radio sources due to the strong interaction between
the binary and a standard disk, while the absence of X-shaped FRI radio

inefficient accretion flow in FRI radio sources is negligible. It is suggested
that the binary would keep misaligned with the outer disk for most of the life

in the nuclei of galaxies. The candidate objects are too massive to be neutron
stars, and for this reason they are considered to be black holes. While the
evidence based on mass is certainly strong, there is no proof yet that any of
the objects possesses the defining characteristic of a black hole, namely an
event horizon. Type I X-ray bursts, which are the result of thermonuclear
explosions when gas accretes onto the surface of a compact star, may provide
important evidence in this regard. Type I bursts are commonly observed in
accreting neutron stars, which have surfaces, but have never been seen in
accreting black hole candidates. It is argued that the lack of bursts in black
hole candidates is compelling evidence that these objects do not have surfaces.
The objects must therefore possess event horizons.

comparison and to assess the influence of finite-size and resolution effects.
The most interesting result is the discovery of a polytropic-like relationship
between the average velocity dispersion (internal kinetic energy) and the mass
density in an intermediate range of densities, K ~ rho^{2-eta}. The exponent
eta measures the deviations from the virial prediction, eta_virial=0. For
self-similar models, eta depends only on the spectral index of the initial
power spectrum. We also study CDM models and confirm a previous result that the

for a recently proposed theoretical model of cosmological structure formation

regularizing the density singularities.

easily be explained by any simple model. However, by making a `flux-flux' plot
which combines the low state data with data obtained during a normal flux
state, we demonstrate that the extremely hard spectrum observed above 2 keV
results from a continuation of the spectral variability seen in the normal
state, which is caused by spectral pivoting of the power-law continuum. The
pivoting power-law appears to be attached to a Comptonised thermal component of
variable flux (blackbody temperature kT~0.1 keV, consistent with the small
black hole mass in NGC 4051) which dominates the soft X-ray band in the low
state, and is probably the source of seed photons for Comptonisation.
Additional constant thermal and reflection components, together with absorption

the cluster, their interstellar gas may have been lost through ram pressure
stripping by the hot X-ray emitting gas of the cluster. We estimate the maximum
radius out to which galaxies can bounce out of a virialized system using
analytical arguments and cosmological N-body simulations. In particular, we
derive an expression for the turnaround radius in a flat cosmology with a
cosmological constant that is simpler than previously derived expressions. We
find that the maximum radius reached by infalling galaxies as they bounce out
of their cluster is roughly between 1 and 2.5 virial radii. Comparing to the
virial radius of the Virgo cluster, which we estimate from X-ray observations,
these HI-deficient galaxies appear to lie significantly further away from the
cluster center. Therefore, if their distances to the cluster core are correct,
the HI-deficient spiral galaxies found outside of the Virgo cluster cannot have
lost their gas by ram pressure from the hot intracluster gas.

X-ray morphology is a nearly circular shell with a radius of about 40 pc, which
is bright on the northern and western sides. The spectra of the shells are
different from region to region. The southern shell shows clear emission lines,
and is well fitted with a model of a thin-thermal plasma (kT = 0.21keV) in
non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) plus a power-law component. This thermal
plasma is located inside of the H alpha emission, which is the outer edge of
the shell of the SB. The northern and western sides of the SB are dim in H
alpha emission, but are bright in non-thermal (power-law) X-rays with a photon
index of 2.1-2.9. The non-thermal X-ray shell traces the outer boundary of the
radio shell. These features of thin-thermal and non-thermal X-rays are similar
to those of SN 1006, a prototype of synchrotron X-ray shell, but the
non-thermal component of 30 Dor C is about ten-times brighter than that of SN
1006. 30 Dor C is the first candidate of an extragalactic SB, in which
energetic electrons are accelerating in the shell. The age is much older than
that of SN 1006, and hence the particle acceleration time in this SB may be
longer than those in normal shell-like SNRs. We found point-like sources
associated with some of tight star clusters. The X-ray luminosity and spectrum
are consistent with those of young clusters of massive stars. Point-like
sources with non-thermal spectra are also found in the SB. These may be

with our numerical observation of a fluctuation-dissipation plot for the

coherent observables make measurements of $\Xin$ easier than the traditionally
used incoherent ones, producing fluctuation-dissipation plots whose slope is
close to $\Xin$ over a much larger range.

weak and strong coupling to the bath. The coherence-induced reduction of noise
is diminished by weak dissipation and/or a large level separation (bias). For
weak dissipation, we demonstrate that the dephasing and relaxation rates of the
two-level system can be extracted from noise. In the strong dissipation regime,
the localisation-delocalisation transition becomes visible in the low-frequency
noise.

aspects of the glass transition in colloids (particularly when short-range

statistical mechanics, account qualitatively for nonlinear flow behaviour such
as the yield stress of a hard-sphere colloidal glass. Such theories so far only
predict shear thinning behaviour, whereas in real colloids both shear thinning
and shear thickening can be found. The latter observation can, however, be
rationalised by postulating an MCT vertex that is not only a decreasing
function of strain rate (as found from first principles) but also an increasing
function of stress. Within a highly simplified, schematic MCT model this can
lead not only to discontinuous shear thickening but also to complete arrest of
a fluid phase under the influence of an external stress (`full jamming').

The largest two exchange constants, J1/kB=-18.2+/-0.5K and J1'/kB=-24.3+/-0.6K,
were obtained from large peaks in the differential susceptibility, dM/dH,
measured in pulsed magnetic fields, H, up to 500 kOe. These two largest J's are
associated with the two inequivalent classes of nearest neighbors (NN's) in the
wurtzite structure. The 29% difference between J1 and J1' is substantially
larger than 13% in CdS:Mn, and 15% in CdSe:Mn. The pulsed-field data also
indicate that, despite the direct contact between the samples and a
superfluid-helium bath, substantial departures from thermal equilibrium
occurred during the 7.4 ms pulse. The third- and fourth-largest J's were
determined from the magnetization M at 20 mK, measured in dc magnetic fields H
up to 90 kOe. Both field orientations H||c and H||[10-10] were studied. (The
[10-10] direction is perpendicular to the c-axis, [0001].) By definition,
neighbors which are not NN's are distant neighbors (DN's). The largest DN
exchange constant (third-largest overall), has the value J/kB=-0.543+/-0.005K,
and is associated with the DN at r=c. Because this is not the closest DN, this
result implies that the J's do not decrease monotonically with the distance r.
The second-largest DN exchange constant (fourth-largest overall), has the value
J/kB=-0.080 K. It is associated with one of the two classes of neighbors that
have a coordination number z=12, but the evidence is insufficient for a
definite unique choice. The dependence of M on the direction of H gives
D/kB=-0.039+/-0.008K, in fair agreement with -0.031 K from earlier EPR work.

composite will generally consist of alternating current (AC) fields at
frequencies of higher-order harmonics. The situation becomes more interesting
when the suspended particles are graded, with a spatial variation in the
dielectric properties. The local electric field inside the graded particles can
be calculated by the differential effective dipole approximation, which agrees
very well with a first-principles approach. In this work, a nonlinear
differential effective dipole approximation and a perturbation expansion method
have been employed to investigate the effect of gradation on the nonlinear AC
responses of these composites. The results showed that the fundamental and
third-harmonic AC responses are sensitive to the dielectric-constant and/or
nonlinear-susceptibility gradation profiles within the particles. Thus, by
measuring the AC responses of the graded composites, it is possible to perform
a real-time monitoring of the fabrication process of the gradation profiles

spatial width, which cannot be simultaneously diagonalized. Thus, the counting
of compatible states is not sharply defined. The resolution of this and other
formal difficulties leads naturally to a definition in terms of discretized
light-cone quantization. In this form, the area difference specified in the

longitudinal momentum contains no more than exp(2 pi^2 K) independent discrete

theory of exterior forms, being invariant one, does not answer the questions
related to the evolutionary processes. In the work the readers are introduced
to the skew-symmetric differential forms that possess evolutionary properties.
They were called evolutionary ones. The radical distinction between the
evolutionary forms and the exterior ones consists in the fact that the exterior
forms are defined on manifolds with closed metric forms, whereas the
evolutionary forms are defined on manifolds with unclosed metric forms. The
mathematical apparatus of exterior and evolutionary forms allows description of
discrete transitions, quantum steps, evolutionary processes, generation of
various structures. These are radically new possibilities of the mathematical
physics. A role of exterior and evolutionary forms in the mathematical physics
is conditioned by the fact that they reflect properties of the conservation
laws and allow elucidate a mechanism of evolutionary processes in material

electrocardiogram and arterial blood pressure lasting 6 minutes, were analyzed
in supine position (SUP), during the first (HD1), and the second parts (HD2) of
$90^{\circ}$ head down tilt and during recovery (REC). The wavelet transform
was performed using the Haar function of period $T=2^j$ ($% j=1$,2,$... $,6) to
obtain wavelet coefficients. Power spectra components were analyzed within
three bands, VLF (0.003-0.04), LF (0.04-0.15) and HF (0.15-0.4) with the
frequency unit cycle/interval. Wavelet transform demonstrated a higher
discrimination among all analyzed periods than the Fourier transform. For the
Fourier analysis, the LF of R-R intervals and VLF of systolic blood pressure
show more evident difference for different body positions. For the wavelet
analysis, the systolic blood pressures show much more evident difference than
the R-R intervals. This study suggests a difference in the response of the
vessels and the heart to different body positions. The partial dissociation
between VLF and LF results is a physiologically relevant finding of this work.

known as antigens, through very complex interactions involving the antigens and
the system's own entities. One remarkable feature resulting from such
interactions is the immune system's ability to improve its capability to fight
antigens commonly found in the individual's environment. This adaptation
process is called the evolution of specificity. In this paper, we introduce a
new mathematical model for the evolution of specificity in humoral immunity,
based on Jerne's functional, or idiotypic, network. The evolution of
specificity is modeled as the dynamic updating of connection weights in a graph
whose nodes are related to the network's idiotypes. At the core of this
weight-updating mechanism are the increase in specificity caused by clonal
selection and the decrease in specificity due to the insertion of uncorrelated
idiotypes by the bone marrow. As we demonstrate through numerous computer
experiments, for appropriate choices of parameters the new model correctly
reproduces, in qualitative terms, several immune functions.

with anticodon UAG, translates the four-codon family CUN, whilst the other,
with anticodon UAA, translates the two-codon family UUR. These two genes must
differ at the third anticodon position, but in some species the genes differ at
many additional sites, indicating that these genes have been independent for a
long time. Duplication and deletion of genes in mitochondrial genomes occurs
frequently during the evolution of the Metazoa. If a tRNA-Leu gene were
duplicated and a substitution occurred in the anticodon, this would effectively
turn one type of tRNA into the other. The original copy of the second tRNA type
might then be lost by a deletion elsewhere in the genome. There are several
groups of species in which the two tRNA-Leu genes occur next to one another (or
very close) on the genome, which suggests that tandem duplication has occurred.
Here we use RNA-specific phylogenetic methods to determine evolutionary trees
for both genes. We present evidence that the process of duplication, anticodon
mutation and deletion of tRNA-Leu genes has occurred at least five times during
the evolution of the Metazoa - once in the common ancestor of all Protostomes,
once in the common ancestor of Echinoderms and Hemichordates, once in the
hermit crab, and twice independently in Molluscs.

systems, some considerations about the positivity of factorized Markovian

positivity of the whole time-evolution in general does not ask for the complete
positivity of the single system time-evolutions, if they are allowed to differ.
However, they must be completely positive if one is a small perturbation of the
other, which is the typical situation for open systems in a heat bath.

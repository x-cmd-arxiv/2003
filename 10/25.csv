  M-sigma Relation","submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/426467",,"astro-ph",,"  A new theory of quasars is presented in which the matter of thin accretion
disks around black holes is supplied by stars that plunge through the disk.
Stars in the central part of the host galaxy are randomly perturbed to highly
radial orbits, and as they repeatedly cross the disk they lose orbital energy
by drag, eventually merging into the disk. Requiring the rate of stellar mass
capture to equal the mass accretion rate into the black hole, a relation
between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion is predicted of
the form M_{BH} \propto sigma_*^{30/7}. The normalization depends on various
uncertain parameters such as the disk viscosity, but is consistent with
observation for reasonable assumptions. We show that a seed central black hole
in a newly formed stellar system can grow at the Eddington rate up to this
predicted mass via stellar captures by the accretion disk. Once this mass is
reached, star captures are insufficient to maintain an Eddington accretion
rate, and the quasar may naturally turn off as the accretion switches to a
low-efficiency advection mode. The model provides a mechanism to deliver mass
to the accretion disk at small radius, probably solving the problem of
gravitational instability to star formation in the disk at large radius. We
note that the matter from stars that is incorporated to the disk has an average
specific angular momentum that is very small or opposite to that of the disk,
and discuss how a rotating disk may be maintained as it captures this matter if
a small fraction of the accreted mass comes from stellar winds that form a disk
extending to larger radius. We propose several observational tests and
consequences of this theory.

from nonthermal intensity information. Synchrotron and inverse-Compton
intensities provided meaningful information about distributions and strengths
of magnetic fields, although considerable care was called for. Correlations
between radio and X-ray surface brightness correctly revealed useful dynamical
relationships between particles and fields. Magnetic field strength estimates
derived from the ratio of X-ray to radio intensity were mostly within about a
factor of two of the RMS field strength along a given line of sight. When
emissions along a given line of sight were dominated by regions close to the
minimum energy/equipartition condition, the field strengths derived from the
standard power-law-spectrum minimum energy calculation were also reasonably
close to actual field strengths, except when spectral aging was evident.
Otherwise, biases in the minimum- energy magnetic field estimation mirrored
actual differences from equipartition. The ratio of the inverse-Compton
magnetic field to the minimum-energy magnetic field provided a rough measure of
the actual total energy in particles and fields in most instances, within an
order of magnitude. This may provide a practical limit to the accuracy with
which one may be able to establish the internal energy density or pressure of
optically thin synchrotron sources.

with spectra of the galaxies NGC4418 and M83 and with dust models suggest that
it is best represented by combinations of a typical starburst component,
exhibiting PAH emission features, and a heavily absorbed dust continuum which
contributes ~40% of the 6-12 micron flux and likely dominates the luminosity.
Of particular significance relative to previous studies of Arp220 is the fact
that the emission feature at 7.7 micron comprises both PAH emission and a
broader component resulting from ice and silicate absorption against a heavily
absorbed continuum. Extinction to the PAH emitting source, however, appears to
be relatively low. We tentatively associate the PAH emitting and heavily
dust/ice absorbed components with the diffuse emission region and the two
compact nuclei respectively identified by Soifer et al. (2002) in their higher
spatial resolution 10 micron study. Both the similarity of the absorbed
continuum with that of the embedded Galactic protostars and results of the dust
models imply that the embedded source(s) in Arp220 could be powered by, albeit
extremely dense, starburst activity. Due to the high extinction, it is not
possible with the available data to exclude that AGN(s) also contribute some or
all of the observed luminosity. In this case, however, the upper limit measured

a thermal model with temperature kT~1.6 keV and subsolar abundances.
Interestingly, an additional hard X-ray component is required to fit the EPIC
spectra of the halo above 3 keV, and is independently confirmed by an archival
Chandra observation. However, its physical origin is not clear. Contribution
from a population of undetected Low Mass X-ray Binaries seems unlikely.
Instead, the hard X-ray component could be due to inverse Compton scattering of
the CMB photons off relativistic electrons scattered throughout the halo of the
galaxy, or non-thermal bremsstrahlung emission. The IC/CMB interpretation,
together with limits on the diffuse radio emission, implies a very weak
magnetic field, while a non-thermal bremsstrahlung origin implies the presence
of a large number of very energetic electrons. We also detect X-ray emission
from the outer (~3.5') jet, confirming previous ROSAT findings. Both the EPIC
and ACIS spectra of the jet are best-fitted by a power law with photon index
\~1.2. A thermal model is formally ruled out by the data. Assuming an origin of
the X-rays from the jet via IC/CMB, as suggested by energetic arguments, and
assuming equipartition implies a large Doppler factor (delta~10).
Alternatively, weaker beaming is possible for magnetic fields several orders of
magnitude lower than the equipartition field.

that (1) the oscillations are observed almost exclusively when the accretion

observed at high accretion rates from the 600 Hz sources, whereas it occurs
only at low accretion rates in the 300 Hz sources. The persistent millisecond
pulsars provide the only apparent exceptions to these trends. The first result
might be explained if the oscillation amplitudes are attenuated at low
accretion rates by an extended electron corona. The second result indicates
that the rotation period of the neutron star determines how the burst
properties vary with accretion rate, possibly through the differences in the
effective surface gravity or the strength of the Coriolis force.

  Formulations for Numerical Magnetohydrodynamics",,,"10.1086/381051",,"astro-ph",,"  In recent years, several different strategies have emerged for evolving the
magnetic field in numerical MHD. Some of these methods can be classified as
divergence-cleaning schemes, where one evolves the magnetic field components
just like any other variable in a higher order Godunov scheme. The fact that
the magnetic field is divergence-free is imposed post-facto via a
divergence-cleaning step. Other schemes for evolving the magnetic field rely on
a staggered mesh formulation which is inherently divergence-free. The claim has
been made that the two approaches are equivalent. In this paper we
cross-compare three divergence-cleaning schemes based on scalar and vector
divergence-cleaning and a popular divergence-free scheme. All schemes are
applied to the same stringent test problem. Several deficiencies in all the
divergence-cleaning schemes become clearly apparent with the scalar
divergence-cleaning schemes performing worse than the vector
divergence-cleaning scheme. The vector divergence-cleaning scheme also shows
some deficiencies relative to the staggered mesh divergence-free scheme. The
differences can be explained by realizing that all the divergence-cleaning
schemes are based on a Poisson solver which introduces a non-locality into the
scheme, though other subtler points of difference are also catalogued. By using
several diagnostics that are routinely used in the study of turbulence, it is
shown that the differences in the schemes produce measurable differences in
physical quantities that are of interest in such studies.

similarities with that expected from a circumprimary disk within a highly
eccentric binary system. We assume that either the two M stars in the close
vicinity of HD141569 are bound companions or at least one of them is an
isolated binary companion. We discuss the resulting interaction with an
initially axisymmetric disk. This scenario accounts for the formation of a
spiral structure, a wide gap in the disk and a broad faint extension outside
the truncation radius of the disk after 10-15 orbital periods with no need for
massive companion(s) in the midst of the disk resolved in scattered light. The
simulations match the observations and the star age if the perturber is on an
elliptic orbit with a periastron distance of 930 AU and an eccentricity from
0.7 to 0.9. We find that the numerical results can be reasonably well
reproduced using an analytical approach proposed to explain the formation of a
spiral structure by secular perturbation of a circumprimary disk by an external
bound companion. We also interpret the redness of the disk in the visible
reported by Clampin et al.(2003) and show that short-lived grains one order of
magnitude smaller than the blow-out size limit are abundant in the disk. The
most probable reason for this is that the disk sustains high collisional
activity. Finally we conclude that additional processes are required to clear
out the disk inside 150 AU and that interactions with planetary companions
possibly coupled with the remnant gas disk are likely candidates.

including infinitely long JJs. In a long annular JJ, the dipole generates free

we also find another critical value (in an analytical form too), which is
always slightly smaller than the Fraunhofer value, except for points where both

value is based on an unstable fluxon-antifluxon bound state, therefore it will
probably not manifest itself in the usual (classical) regime. However, it
provides for a dominating instanton configuration for tunnel birth of a free

analyzed in logic programming, turns out to represent several relevant
problems, including optimization problems, very naturally. We define a formal
model for abduction with penalization over logic programs, which extends the
abductive framework proposed by Kakas and Mancarella. We address knowledge
representation issues, encoding a number of problems in our abductive
framework. In particular, we consider some relevant problems, taken from
different domains, ranging from optimization theory to diagnosis and planning;
their encodings turn out to be simple and elegant in our formalism. We
thoroughly analyze the computational complexity of the main problems arising in
the context of abduction with penalization from logic programs. Finally, we
implement a system supporting the proposed abductive framework on top of the
DLV engine. To this end, we design a translation from abduction problems with
penalties into logic programs with weak constraints. We prove that this
approach is sound and complete.

by diagonalizing the theory's Hamiltonian in perturbation theory and taking the
large N limit. At one-loop level the result is known to be equal to the
Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain, which is a well-known integrable system. Here,
integrability implies the existence of hidden conserved charges and results in
a degeneracy of parity pairs in the spectrum. In order to confirm integrability
at higher loops, we show that this degeneracy is not lifted and that
(corrected) conserved charges exist. Plane-wave matrix theory is intricately
connected to N=4 Super Yang-Mills, as it arises as a consistent reduction of
the gauge theory on a three-sphere. We find that after appropriately
renormalizing the mass parameter of the plane-wave matrix theory the effective
Hamiltonian is identical to the dilatation operator of N=4 Super Yang-Mills
theory in the considered subsector. Our results therefore represent a strong
support for the conjectured three-loop integrability of planar N=4 SYM and are
in disagreement with a recent dual string theory finding. Finally, we study the

audience, and provides an elementary introduction to the subject, by presenting
examples that illustrate the theorem, some of its applications, and the main
ideas involved in the proof. It should be largely accessible to second-year
graduate students.
  Chapter 2 gives an elementary introduction to the theory of entropy. Chapter

convection. Our system consists of a long channel with growth inhibited by
uniform UV illumination except in a small ``oasis'', which is shielded from the
UV light. To mimic blood flow or other flow past a localized infection, the
oasis is moved with a constant velocity through the UV-illuminated ``desert''.
The experiments are modeled with a convective reaction-diffusion equation. In
both the experiment and model, localized or extinct populations are found to
develop, depending on conditions, from an initially localized population. The
model also yields states where the population grows everywhere. Further, the
model reveals that the transitions between localized, extended, and extinct
states are continuous and non-hysteretic. However, it does not capture the
oscillations of the localized population that are observed in the experiment.

  Nucleotide sequences contain multiple codes responsible for organism's
functioning and structure. They can be investigated by various signal
processing methods. These techniques are well suited for indication of
frequently encountered sequence motifs (i.e., repeats). However, if there are
two or more codes containing the same motif, the local nucleotide distribution
(i.e., profile), resulting from sequence alignment by the motif position, will
represent overlapping of the code patterns.
  Results
  The novel algorithm for decomposition of pattern overlapping is proposed. It
is capable to work with dispersed repeats as well. The algorithm is based on
cross-correlation procedure applied locally in a cumulative fashion. Its
sensitivity was tested on human genomic sequences.
  Conclusions
  Cumulative Local Cross-Correlation was successfully used to decompose
overlapping of nucleotide patterns in human genomic sequences. Being very
general technique (as general as cross-correlation), it can be easily adopted
in other signal processing applications and naturally extended for
multidimensional cases.
  Software implementation of the algorithm is available on request from the
authors.

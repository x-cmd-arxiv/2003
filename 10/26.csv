emission is best interpreted as inverse Compton (IC) emission off the CMB as

X-ray jets at lower redshift, is a natural consequence of its high redshift.

WMAP results, which now dominate the L < 600 bands. GUS are used to determine

experiments significantly increased the case for accelerated expansion in the
early universe (the inflationary paradigm) and at the current epoch (dark
energy dominance) when they were combined with `prior' probabilities on the

Since cluster of galaxies have a negligible optical depth for resonant
scattering in forbidden and intercombination lines of these ions, these lines
are not additionally broadened. At the same time, they are very intense, which
allows deviations of the spectrum from the Gaussian spectrum in the line wings
to be investigated. The line shape becomes an important indicator of bulk
hydrodynamic processes because the cryogenic detectors of new generation of
X-ray observatories will have a high energy resolution (from 5 eV for ASTRO-E2
to 1-2 eV for Constellation-X and XEUS). We use the spectral representation of
a Kolmogorov cascade in the inertial range to calculate the characteristic
shapes of X-ray lines. Significant deviations in the line profiles from the
Gaussian profile (shape asymmetry, additional peaks, sharp breaks in the
exponential tails) are expected for large-scale turbulence. The kinematic SZ
effect and the X-ray line profile carry different information about the
hydrodynamic velocity distribution in clusters of galaxies and complement each
other, allowing the redshift, the peculiar velocity of the cluster, and the

used to simplify universal equations for higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants.

$\frac{1}{4+\sqrt{8}}mn(1-o(1))$ arc-disjoint directed 4-cycles, improving
earlier lower bounds. Combined with a probabilistic argument, this result is
used to prove that every regular tournament with $n$ vertices contains
$\frac{1}{8+\sqrt{32}}n^2(1-o(1))$ arc-disjoint directed 4-cycles. The result
is also used to provide an upper bound for the distance between two antipodal
vertices in interchange graphs.

isospin diffusion in peripheral asymmetric 112Sn+124Sn, 124Sn+112Sn systems at

quasi-projectile and quasi-target in these collisions do not achieve isospin
equilibrium, permitting an assessment of the isospin transport rates. We find
that comparisons between isospin sensitive experimental and theoretical
observables, using suitably chosen scaled ratios, permit investigation of the
density dependence of the asymmetry term of the nuclear equation of state.

samples at the cellular level and to investigate radiobiological effects at low
doses of high LET ionising radiation. Since 1998 a single-ion irradiation
facility has been developed on the focused horizontal microbeam line of the
CENBG 3.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator. This setup delivers in air single
protons and alpha particles of a few MeV onto cultured cells, with a spatial
resolution of a few microns, allowing subcellular targeting. In this paper, we
present results from the use of the GEANT4 toolkit to simulate cellular
irradiation with the CENBG microbeam line, from the entrance to the microprobe
up to the cellular medium.

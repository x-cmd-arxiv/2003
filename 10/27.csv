distribution. We find an average projected) halo ellipticity of <e_{\rm

such a model provides a very reliable representation of the noninteracting
electrons in this material if strong correlations are ignored. We then
determine whether or not such a model of 3d electrons moving on the Ti
(corner-sharing tetrahedral) sublattice describes the observed
metal-to-insulator transitions, with the critical concentration defined by the
matching of the mobility edge and the chemical potential. Our analysis leads to
quantitative predictions that are in disagreement with those measured
experimentally. For example, experimentally for the LiAlyTi2-yO4 compound an Al
concentration of y_c approximately 0.33 produces a metal-to-insulator
transition, whereas our analysis of a quantum site percolation model predicts
y_c approximately 0.83. One hypothesis that is consistent with these results is
that since strong correlations are ignored in our quantum site percolation
model, which includes the effects of configurational disorder only, such strong
electronic correlations are both present and important.

founded essentially; on the reception that the geometrical properties of the
4-dimensional space-time continuum are defined from the matter in it. Contrary
to this, in the Newtonian Mechanics space and time obey a absolute,
matter-independent meaning. This thesis offers a compromise between the two
conceptions: The spontaneous splitting of space-time in a ""universal time"" and
a ""absolute space"" in the sense of Newton is accepted, but this (1+3)-splitting
will receive the status of a dynamical object in the sense of Einstein. Herein,
the (large scale) dynamics of the (1+3) splitting is coupled only weakly to the
(local) fluctuation of the matter density with the help of the Einsteinian
equations, so that these will keep their validity, regarding the gravitational
phenomena, in a bounded domain of space (planets, stars, galaxies). However, at
a cosmic scale, the properties of the universe as whole will be determined
essentially from the selfdynamics of the space-time splitting. The geometry of
the (1+3)-splitting and the expansion of the empty universe will be examined in
detail. Contrary to the Einsteinian theory, the resulting new theory of
gravitation contains a new degree of freedom, that comes into question as a
carrier for the energy-momentum tensor of the the gravitational interaction.
The ""ground state"" of the empty universe (-> maximal symmetry)is described by
means of a deSitter-geometry, where only the expanding universe renders stable.

(named the stress tensor) vanishes if and only if all the matter fields vanish.
In classical lagrangian field theory the stres tensor is the variational
(symmetric) one and a priori it might occur that for some systems the tensor is
identically zero for all field configurations whereas evolution of the system
is subject to deterministic equations of motion. Such a system would not
generate its own gravitational field. To check if suchsystems may exist we find
a relationship between the stress tensor and the Euler operator. We prove that
if a system of n interacting scalar fields (n cannot exceed the spacetime
dimension d) or a single vector field (if d is even) has the stress tensor such
that its divergence is identically zero (""on and off shell""), then the Lagrange
equations of motion hold identically too. These systems are unphysical as
having no propagation equations at all. Thus nontrivial field equations imply
the nontrivial stress tensor. The theorem breaks down if the of the field
components n is greater than d. We show that for n>d matter systems without
energy and their own gravity (and yet detectable) are in principle admissible.
Their equations of motion are degenerate. We also show for which matter systems
their stress tensors cannot vanish for all solutions of the field equations.

the presence of electro-weak radiative corrections that in principle need to be

with the conventional ideas: The Hamiltonian is first regulated by suitable
cut-off functions, and subsequently renormalized by suitable counter terms to
make it cut-off independent. Emphasized is the considerable freedom in the
cut-off function which eventually can modify the Coulomb potential of two
charges at sufficiently small distances. The approach provides new physical
insight into nature of gauge theory and the potential energy of QCD and QED
near the origin. The so obtained formalism is applied to physical mesons with a
different flavor of quark and anti-quark. The excitation spectrum of the

fit with a four-body phase space including the proton-proton final state
interaction as well as with one-meson exchange calculations neglecting FSI
effects. Therefore, one might think about a compensation of the strong pp
interaction through a pK- FSI effect or an additional degree of freedom caused
by the four-body final state. In the latter case, strong FSI effects can be
expected at Q-values very close to the K+K- production threshold. Such a

in school books. Even though this topic might be complex, it is applicable and
viable in the world that we live in. Holography lends itself to further develop
knowledge with regard to inference optics. However, misconceptions of students
impede the learning process. Research conducted by our research group shows
that problematic perceptions regarding interference optics still exist with
physics students at the intermediate level and on occasion are even sustained
by illustrations in school books. Based on this analysis, a concept for a
series of lessons is introduced. This series can be taught in physics lessons
at the secondary school level II and in basic courses. Initial results from
dealing with the subject of holography in an advanced training course will be
presented.

  transverse equation of motion for an electron in a bunch","15 pages, 3 figures",,,"DESY 03-165","physics.acc-ph",,"  As a consequence of motions driven by external forces, self-fields originate
within an electron bunch, which are different from the static case. In the case
of magnetic external forces acting on an ultrarelativistic beam, the
longitudinal self-interactions are responsible for CSR (Coherent Synchrotron
Radiation)-related phenomena, which have been studied extensively. On the other
hand, transverse self-interactions are present too. At the time being, several
existing theoretical analysis of transverse dynamics rely on the so-called
cancellation effect, which has been around for more than ten years. In this
paper we explain why in our view such an effect is not of practical nor of
theoretical importance.

Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion of the time evolution operator is
presented herein. The technique manifestly preserves wavefunction norm, and it
can be applied to problems in any number of spatial dimensions. We also
identify a particular dimensionless ratio of potential to kinetic energies as a
key coupling constant. This coupling establishes characteristic length and time
scales for a large class of low energy quantum states, and it guides the choice
of step sizes in numerical work. Using the BCH method in conjunction with an
imaginary time rotation, we compute low energy eigenstates for several quantum
systems coupled to non-trivial background potentials. The approach is
subsequently applied to the study of 1D propagating wave packets and 2D bound
state time development. Failures of classical expectations uncovered by
simulations of these simple systems help develop quantum intuition.
  Finally, we investigate the response of a Superconducting Quantum
Interference Device (SQUID) to a time dependent potential. We discuss how to
engineer the potential's energy and time scales so that the SQUID acts as a
quantum NOT gate. The notional simulation we present for this gate provides
useful insight into the design of one candidate building block for a quantum
computer.

structure, there is no indeterminacy in the choice of the creation operators
that create quanta out of a given vacuum. In these cases the notion of a
quantum is universal, i.e., independent of the observer on classical phase
space. Such is the case in all standard applications of quantum mechanics.
However, recent developments suggest that the notion of a quantum may not be
universal. Transformations between observers that do not agree on the notion of
an elementary quantum are called dualities. Classical phase spaces admitting
more than one complex-differentiable structure thus provide a natural framework
to study dualities in quantum mechanics. As an example we quantise a classical
mechanics whose phase space is a torus and prove explicitly that it exhibits
dualities.

Lorentz transformations of these waves yield the aberration and Doppler shift.

that the complete time evolution of these systems (in the interaction picture)
can be expressed, with a high degree of accuracy, as the product of two unitary
evolutions. The first one describes the time evolution related to an effective
coarse grained dynamics. The second is a suitable correction restoring the {\em
fine} dynamics suppressed by the coarse graining performed to adiabatically
eliminate the nonresonantly coupled atomic level.

Fourier transformation (QFT) on the Ising quantum computer (IQC). Two kinds of
errors are studied: (i) due to spurious transitions caused by pulses and (ii)
due to external perturbation. The scaling of errors with system parameters and
number of qubits is explained. We use two different procedures to fight each of
them. To suppress spurious transitions we use correcting pulses (generalized
$2\pi k$ method) while to suppress errors due to external perturbation we use
an improved QFT algorithm. As a result, the fidelity of quantum computation is
increased by several orders of magnitude and is thus stable in a much wider
range of physical parameters.

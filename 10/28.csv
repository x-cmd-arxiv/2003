combination with WMAP and other data. Our results are consistent with a
``vanilla'' flat adiabatic Lambda-CDM model without tilt (n=1), running tilt,
tensor modes or massive neutrinos. Adding SDSS information more than halves the
WMAP-only error bars on some parameters, tightening 1 sigma constraints on the
Hubble parameter from h~0.74+0.18-0.07 to h~0.70+0.04-0.03, on the matter
density from Omega_m~0.25+/-0.10 to Omega_m~0.30+/-0.04 (1 sigma) and on
neutrino masses from <11 eV to <0.6 eV (95%). SDSS helps even more when
dropping prior assumptions about curvature, neutrinos, tensor modes and the
equation of state. Our results are in substantial agreement with the joint
analysis of WMAP and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, which is an impressive
consistency check with independent redshift survey data and analysis
techniques. In this paper, we place particular emphasis on clarifying the
physical origin of the constraints, i.e., what we do and do not know when using
different data sets and prior assumptions. For instance, dropping the
assumption that space is perfectly flat, the WMAP-only constraint on the
measured age of the Universe tightens from t0~16.3+2.3-1.8 Gyr to
t0~14.1+1.0-0.9 Gyr by adding SDSS and SN Ia data. Including tensors, running
tilt, neutrino mass and equation of state in the list of free parameters, many
constraints are still quite weak, but future cosmological measurements from
SDSS and other sources should allow these to be substantially tightened.

supernova ejecta of massive primordial stars in a cosmological framework to
determine whether this first population of stars could have enriched the
universe to the levels and dispersions seen by the most recent observations of
the Lyman-Alpha forest. We evolve a lambda CDM model in a 1 Mpc^3 volume to a
redshift of z = 15 and add ``bubbles'' of metal corresponding to the supernova
ejecta of the first generation of massive stars in all dark matter halos with
masses greater than 5 times 10^5 solar masses. These initial conditions are
then evolved to z = 3 and the distribution and levels of metals are compared to
observations. In the absence of further star formation the primordial metal is
initially contained in halos and filaments. Photoevaporation of metal-enriched
gas due to the metagalactic ultraviolet background radiation at the epoch of
reionization (z ~ 6) causes a sharp increase of the metal volume filling
factor. At z = 3, ~ 2.5% of the simulation volume (approx. 20% of the total gas
mass) is filled with gas enriched above a metallicity of 10^-4 Z_solar, and
less than 0.6% of the volume is enriched above a metallicity of 10^-3 Z_solar.
This suggests that, even with the most optimistic prescription for placement of
primordial supernova and the amount of metals produced by each supernova, this
population of stars cannot entirely be responsible for the enrichment of the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest to the levels and dispersions seen by current
observations unless we have severely underestimated the duration of the Pop III
epoch. However, comparison to observations show that Pop III supernovae can be
significant contributors to the very low overdensity Lyman-Alpha forest.

heating associated with the dissipation of these waves can offset radiative
cooling rates in cooling flow clusters of galaxies. This heating mechanism
leads to spatially distributed and approximately symmetrical dissipation. The
heating waves reach a given distance from the cluster center on a timescale
shorter than the cooling time. This means that this heating mechanism has the
potential of quenching cooling flows in a quasi-stable fashion. Moreover, the
heating is gentle as no strong shocks are present in the simulations. We first
investigated whether a single continuous episode of AGN activity can lead to
adequate dissipation to balance cooling rates. These simulations demonstrated
that, whereas secondary waves generated by the interaction of the rising bubble
with the intracluster medium are clearly present, viscous heating associated
with the dissipation of these waves is insufficient to balance radiative
cooling. It is only when the central source is intermittent that the viscous
dissipation of waves associated with subsequent episodes of activity can offset
cooling. This suggests that the ripples observed in the Perseus cluster can be
interpreted as being due to the AGN duty cycle, i.e., they trace AGN activity
history. The simulations were performed using the PPM adaptive mesh refinement

a hot surrounding medium. We measure column densities of high-velocity high ion
absorption, and compare the kinematics of low, intermediate, and high
ionization gas along the five sight lines. We find that in all five cases, the
H I and O VI high-velocity components are centered within 20 km/s of one
another, with an average displacement of <v(O VI)-v(H I)>=3+-12 km/s. In those
directions where the H I emission extends to more negative velocities (the
so-called high-velocity ridge), so does the O VI absorption. We compare our
high ion column density ratios to the predictions of various models, adjusted
to account for both recent updates to the solar elemental abundances, and for
the relative elemental abundance ratios in Complex C. Our observed ratios are
inconsistent with collisional ionization equilibrium at one kinetic
temperature. Photoionization by the extragalactic background is ruled out as
the source of the high ions, since the path lengths required would make Complex
C unreasonably large. We consider the most likely origin for the highly ionized
high-velocity gas to be at the conductive or turbulent interfaces between the
neutral/warm ionized components of Complex C and a surrounding hot medium. The
presence of interfaces on the surface of HVCs provides indirect evidence for
the existence of a hot medium in which the HVCs are immersed.

damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) using cosmological smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of the Lambda cold dark matter model. Our
simulations include a phenomenological model for feedback by galactic winds
which allows us to examine the effect of galactic outflows on the distribution
of SFR and metallicity of DLAs. For models with strong galactic winds, we
obtain good agreement with recent observations with respect to total neutral
hydrogen mass density, N_HI column-density distribution, abundance of DLAs, and
for the distribution of SFR in DLAs. However, we also find that the median
metallicity of simulated DLAs is higher than the values typically observed by
nearly an order of magnitude. This discrepancy with observations could be due
to shortcomings in the treatment of the supernova feedback or the multiphase
structure of the gas in our current simulations. Recent observations by Wolfe
et al. (2003a,b) seem to point to the same problem; i.e. the observed DLA
metallicities are much lower than those expected from the (either observed or
simulated) DLA star formation rates, a puzzle that has been known as the
``missing metals'' problem for the globally averaged quantities.

range of initial disk parameters. Disk masses out to 20 AU range from 0.075 to
0.125 $M_{\odot}$, roughly consistent with the high-end of the mass
distribution inferred for disks around T Tauri stars. The initial disks span
minimum $Q$ parameters between 0.8 and 2, with most models being around $\sim
1.4$. The disks are evolved assuming either a locally isothermal equation of
state or an adiabatic equation of state with varying $\gamma$. When
overdensities above a specific threshold appear as a result of gravitational
instability in a locally isothermal calculation, the equation of state is
switched to adiabatic to account for the increased optical depth. We show that
when a disk has a minimum $Q$ parameter less than 1.4 strong trailing spiral
instabilities, typically three or four armed modes, form and grow until
fragmentation occurs along the arms after about 5 mean disk orbital times. The
resulting clumps contract quickly to densities several orders of magnitude
higher than the initial disk density, and the densest of them survive even
under adiabatic conditions. These clumps are stable to tidal disruption and
merge quickly, leaving 2-3 protoplanets on fairly eccentric orbits (the mean
eccentricity being around 0.2) with masses between 0.7 and more than $7
M_{Jup}$, well in agreement with those of detected extrasolar planets.after
$\sim 10^3$ years. Fragmentation is not strongly dependent on whether the disk
starts from a marginally unstable state or gradually achieves it, as shown by a
test where the disk gradually achieves the critical $Q$ by growing in mass.

the RGB. The HB distribution is also found to be consistent with the multiple
stellar populations of the RGB. From our population models, we propose that the

identify, for the first time, a continuous and slanting RGB bump in the CMD of

rotation curve, where the mass is proportional to r and thickness to 1/r. Such
disks should form from the collapse of uniformly rotating, isolated, gaseous
clouds, either proto-galactic, galaxy-mass damped Lyman alpha clouds or the gas
that survives galaxy mergers. We propose that in any case the disk will be
unstable to the Rossby vortex instability (RVI). This instability grows from
any large, steep pressure gradient in an optically thick disk. Such pressure
gradients either occur adjacent to compact objects or could be triggered by
individual supernovae in and around the disk. Upon excitation, the RVI
transports angular momentum far more efficiently than the turbulence of a
viscosity-based Shakura-Sunyaev disk. The critical column density condition in
a L* Mestel disk predicts that the black hole mass is ~ 10^8 Msolar and is also
proportional to the 1/4 power of the velocity dispersion, in accordance with
observations.

reach a depth of K=21.5, corresponding to K*+3.5 mag. The evolution of the
galaxy properties are discussed in terms of their K band luminosity functions
and the K band Hubble diagram of brightest cluster galaxies.
  The bulk of the galaxy luminosities, as characterised by the parameter K*
from the Schechter (1976) function, are found to be consistent with passive
evolution with a redshift of formation of z_f~1.5-2. This is consistent with
observations of other high redshift clusters, but may be in disagreement with
galaxies in the field at similar redshifts. A good match to the shape of the
Coma cluster luminosity function is found by simply dimming the high redshift
luminosity function by an amount consistent with passive evolution. The
evolution of the cumulative fraction of K band light as a function of
luminosity shows no evidence of merger activity in the brighter galaxies.
  The evolution of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) is tested by their K
band Hubble diagram and by the fraction of K band cluster light in the BCGs.
The evolution observed is consistent with recent previous observations although
the scatter in the Hubble diagram allows for a range of evolutionary histories.
The fraction of cluster light contained in the BCGs is not smaller than that in
Coma, suggesting that they are already very massive with no need to hypothesise
significant mergers in their futures.

the (B-R) colour in a number of fields at different galactocentric distances.
  From the field-to-field variation of the two quantities we determine the SBF
distance by means of the (B-R)-\bar{M}_R relation. The derived distances of the
dwarfs are ranging from 14.9-21.3Mpc, with a mean 1sigma uncertainty of 1.4Mpc,
confirming that there is considerable depth in the distance distribution of
early-type cluster members. For IC3388 our SBF distance of 17.0+-1.5Mpc is in
good agreement with the Harris et al. result based on HST observations and the
tip magnitude of the red giant branch. Combining our results with existing
distances for giant Virgo ellipticals we identify two major galaxy
concentrations: a broad primary clump around 15.8Mpc and a narrow secondary
clump around 18.5Mpc. An adaptive kernel analysis finds the two concentrations
to be significant at the 99% and 89% levels. While the near-side clump of Virgo
early-type galaxies can be associated to the subcluster centered on M87, the
second clump is believed to be mainly due to the backside infalling group of
galaxies around M86. The ages and metallicities of the dE stellar populations
are estimated by combining the observed (B-R) colours with Worthey's stellar
population synthesis models. It appears that the Virgo dEs cover a wider range
in metallicity than Fornax cluster dEs. The derived metallicities place the
Virgo dEs on the extension of the [Fe/H]-M_V relation defined by the Local
Group dEs. The data further suggest an age range from genuinly old stellar
systems like IC3019 to intermediate-age dwarfs like NGC4431.

function is employed for atomic scattering while the full Mie theory of

scattering is incorporated. The increase in forward scattering of photons by
the dust particles yields into an increase in the mean intensity as compared to

hundred kiloparsecs from active galactic nuclei, are now studied over many
decades in frequency of electromagnetic spectrum, from radio until (possibly)
TeV gamma rays. For hundreds of known radio jets, only about 25 are observed at
optical frequencies. Most of them are relatively short and faint, with only a
few exceptions, like 3C 273 or M 87, allowing for detailed spectroscopic and
morphological studies. Somewhat surprisingly, the large-scale jets can be very
prominent in X-rays. Up to now, about 25 jets were detected within the 1 - 10
keV energy range, although the nature of this emission is still under debate.
In general, both optical and X-ray jet observations present serious problems
for standard radiation models for the considered objects. Recent TeV
observations of M 87 suggest the possibility of generating large photon fluxes
at these high energies by its extended jet.
  In this paper we summarize information about multiwavelength emission of the

radiation models (connected with relativistic bulk velocities, jet radial
stratification and particle energization all the way along the jet), which can
possibly explain some of the mentioned puzzling observations. We also comment

measure the local magnetic susceptibility at different distances from the

less intense satellite peaks. The shift of the central peak measures the
uniform susceptibility, which displays a Haldane gap $Delta$$equiv$100 K and it
corresponds to an AF coupling J$equiv$260 K between the near-neighbor Ni spins.
Zn or Cu substitution does not affect the Haldane gap. The satellites, which
are evenly distributed on the two sides of the central peak, probe the
antiferromagnetic staggered magnetization near the substituted site, which
decays exponentially. Its extension is found identical for both impurities and
corresponds accurately to the correlation length $xi$(T) determined by Monte
Carlo (QMC) simulations for the pure compound. In the case of non-magnetic Zn,
the temperature dependence of the induced magnetization is consistent with a
Curie law with an ""effective"" spin S=0.4 on each side of Zn, which is well
accounted by Quantum Monte Carlo computations of the spinless-defect-induced
magnetism. In the case of magnetic Cu, the similarity of the induced magnetism
to the Zn case implies a weak coupling of the Cu spin to the nearest- neighbor
Ni spins. The slight reductionin the induced polarization with respect to Zn is
reproduced by QMC computations by considering an antiferromagnetic coupling of

secret sharing schemes were designed to work with numbers. As the first step,
we propose conditions for ""graph to number"" conversion methods. Hence, the
existing schemes can be used, without weakening their properties. Next, we show
how graph properties can be used to extend capabilities of secret sharing
schemes. This leads to proposal of using such properties for number based
secret sharing.

applied to the public-key cryptosystem called ""Polly Cracker"". In this case the
graph structure is a public key, while proper 3-colouring of the graph is a
private key. We show how to share the private key. Sharing particular

distributions of fluid through numerical means. In particular, systems
involving neutron star models driven far from equilibrium in the strong-field
regime of general relativity are studied. Hydrostatic solutions of Einstein's
equations using a stiff, polytropic equation of state are used for the stellar
models. Many of the scenarios we examine involve highly-relativistic flows that
require improvements upon previously published numerical methods to simulate.
Here our particular focus is on the physical behavior of the coupled
fluid-gravitational system at the threshold of black hole formation--so-called
black hole critical phenomena. To investigate such phenomena starting from
conditions representing stable stars, we must drive the star far from its
initial stable configuration. We use one of two different mechanisms to do
this: setting the initial velocity profile of the star to be in-going, or
collapsing a shell of massless scalar field onto the star. Both of these
approaches give rise to a large range of dynamical scenarios that the star may
follow. These scenarios have been extensively surveyed by using different
initial star solutions, and by varying either the magnitude of the velocity
profile or the amplitude of the scalar field pulse. In addition to illuminating
the critical phenomena associated with the fluid collapse, the resulting phase
diagram of possible outcomes provides an approximate picture of the stability
of neutron stars to large, external perturbations that may occur in nature.

the context of general relativity has a long and distinguished history. The
distinctive feature of these models is that, in some way or another, they
require the presence of negative mass in order to maintain stability against
Coulomb's repulsion. Typically, the particle contains a core of $negative$ mass
surrounded by a positive-mass outer layer, which emerges from the
Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m field.
  In this work we show how the Einstein-Maxwell field equations can be used to
construct an extended model where the mass is positive everywhere. This
requires the principal pressures to be unequal inside the particle. The model
is obtained by setting the ""effective"" matter density, rather than the rest
matter density, equal to zero. The Schwarzschild mass of the particle arises
from the electrical and gravitational field (Weyl tensor) energy. The model
satisfies the energy conditions of Hawking and Ellis. A particular solution
that illustrates the results is presented.

about 610 pb-1 collected at centre-of-mass energies of sqrt(s) 189-209 GeV. An
important consequence of R-parity violation is that the lightest supersymmetric
particle is expected to be unstable. Searches of R-parity violating decays of
charged sleptons, sneutrinos and squarks have been performed under the
assumptions that the lightest supersymmetric particle decays promptly and that
only one of the R-parity violating couplings is dominant for each of the decay
modes considered. Such processes would yield final states consisting of

single-like excess of events has been observed with respect to the Standard

  reformulated more precisely, new subsection 2.5",,,"UASLP-IF-04-001","hep-ph",,"  We ask the question whether neutrino physics with momentum space Majorana
spinors, the eigenvectors of the particle--antiparticle conjugation operator,
C=i\gamma_2 K (with K standing for complex conjugation), is different but
physics with Dirac spinors. First we analyze properties of Majorana spinors in
great detail. We show that four dimensional, (4d), Majorana spinors are
unsuited for the construction of a local quantum field because C invariance
does not allow for a covariant propagation in four spinor dimensions, a conduct
due to \gamma_2\gamma_\mu= -\gamma_\mu * \gamma_2. The way out of this dilemma
is finding one more discrete symmetry that respects C invariance and gives rise
to covariant propagators. We construct such a symmetry in observing that the
parity operator, \gamma_0, ``ladders'' between (4d) rest-frame Majorana
spinors, which takes us to eight dimensional spinor spaces. We build up two
types of (8d) spaces-- one with a symmetric- and an other with an
anti-symmetric off diagonal metric and calculate traces of single beta-- and
neutrinoless double beta (0\nu\beta \beta) decays there. We find physics with
(8d) Majorana spinors in the former space to be equivalent to physics with
Dirac spinors in four dimensions. In the latter space we make the rare
observation that in effect of cancellations triggered by the anti-symmetric off
diagonal (8d) metric, the neutrino mass drops from the single beta decay trace
but reappears in 0\nu \beta\beta, without the neutrino being massless in its
free equation-- a curious and in principle experimentally testable signature
for a non-trivial impact of Majorana framework.

heavier spectrum. We explore the consequences of perturbations on some flavor
relations given in the literature. In addition, for a quasi-degenerate neutrino
spectrum it is shown that: (i) starting from a bi-maximal mixing scenario, the
corrections to the mass matrices keep tan theta_atm very close to unity while
they can lower tan theta_sol to its measured value; (ii) beginning from a

results in terms of a complete experiment simulation, we show the corresponding
bi-rate graphs as useful tools to investigate the CP phase-dependencies

probabilities, bi-rate graphs use the total event rates of two measurements
simultaneously as a function of the CP phase. Since they allow error bars for
direct quantitative estimates, they can be used for a direct comparison with a
complete statistical experiment simulation. We find that one can describe the
CP phase dependencies of the mentioned measurements at neutrino superbeam
setups, as well as one can understand the role of the $\mathrm{sgn} (\Delta

perturbative Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. The appeal of this
proposal is that these features are a manifestation of the non-perturbative
sector of the SM, requiring no assumptions about new physics beyond presently
attainable experimental limits. In this thesis we apply non-perturbative
techniques to two complementary models: a toy 4-fermion model containing
explicit chiral symmetry-breaking terms and the quenched hypercharge gauge
interaction. Understanding of how fermion mass, generations and CP-violation
might arise is first investigated in the toy 4-fermion model. It is shown that
different scale-invariant 4-fermion operators are present for the three
subspaces of the full theory, enabling self-consistent introduction of three
fermion generations. The second part of the thesis is concerned with dynamical
fermion mass generation in the quenched hypercharge interaction. In particular
we follow the successful procedure developed for QED, developing a 1-loop
renormalisable vertex {\it ansatz} for solution of the fermion self-energy
Dyson-Schwinger equation. We find two mass ""gaps"", possibly corresponding to
two types of scalar 4-fermion pairing. These ""gaps"" cannot, however, be
interpreted as physical fermion mass. An alternative possibility, that of a
rearrangement of fermionic degrees of freedom analogous to spin-charge

of any effective theory capturing well-tested gravitational and matter physics,
without regard to the details of short-distance gravitational couplings. In
this paper, a subtle effective description avoiding the problem is presented in
a first quantized language, consistent with experiments and the Equivalence
Principle. First quantization allows a minimal domain of validity to be carved
out by cutting on the proper length of particle worldlines. This is facilitated
by working in (locally) Euclidean spacetime, although considerations of
unitarity are still addressed by analytic continuation from Lorentzian
spacetime. The new effective description demonstrates that the cosmological
constant problem {\it is} sensitive to short-distance details of gravity, which
can be probed experimentally. ``Fat Gravity'' toy models are presented,
illustrating how gravity might shut off at short but testable distances, in a
generally covariant manner that suppresses the cosmological constant. This
paper improves on previous work by allowing generalizations to massless matter,
non-trivial spins, non-perturbative phenomena, and multiple (metastable) vacua.

modelled as a mobile robot with two wheels. A recurrent neural network is used
to produce the motor outputs and to hold the internal dynamics. Agents are
developed to take turns on a two-dimensional arena by causing the network
structures to evolve.
  Turn-taking is established using either regular or chaotic behaviour of the
agents. It is found that chaotic turn-takers are more sensitive to the adaptive
inputs from the other agent. Conversely, regular turn-takers are comparatively
robust against noisy inputs, owing to their restricted dynamics. From many
observations, including turn-taking with virtual agents, we claim that there is
a complementary relationship between robustness and adaptability. Furthermore,
by investigating the recoupling of agents from different GA generations, we
report the emergence of a new turn-taking behaviour. Potential for synthesizing
a new form of motion is another characteristic of chaotic turn-takers.

expansion for massless quanta to heavy quarks with mass $M$ in a QCD plasma

Numerical evaluation of the first order in opacity energy loss shows that both
charm and bottom energy losses are much closer to the incoherent radiation
limit than light partons in nuclear collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies.

judge, of such an apparent misconduct by Sir Martin Rees, the British
Astronomer Royal, and others. Unethical behaviour is not unknown in science. My
sole intention is to call attention to the problem by way of example, in an
attempt to contribute to a more ethical atmosphere, which would in my opinion
be beneficial to the field.

to construct closure models for the numerical solution of coarse-grained
Navier-Stokes equations. It is based on synthetically generating a
scale-invariant subgrid-scale field and analytically evaluating its effects on
large resolved scales. In this paper, we propose an extension of previous work
by developing a multiaffine fractal interpolation scheme and demonstrate that
it preserves not only the fractal dimension but also the higher-order structure
functions and the non-Gaussian probability density function of the velocity
increments. Extensive a-priori analyses of atmospheric boundary layer
measurements further reveal that this Multiaffine closure model has the
potential for satisfactory performance in large-eddy simulations. The
pertinence of this newly proposed methodology in the case of passive scalars is
also discussed.

potential is investigated. At high transition rate, we use a perturbation
method to obtain the analytical solution of the model. It is found that the net
current is a peaked function of thermal noise, barrier height and the
fluctuation ratio between the two states. The thermal noise may facilitate the
directed motion at a finite intensity. The asymmetry parameter of the potential
is sensitive to the direction of the net current.

detector (ViP detector) goes along with an enormous reduction of electronic
channels compared to pure pixel devices. However, the special concept of the
readout structure demands for adequate position reconstruction methods.
Theoretical considerations reflecting the choice and the combination of linear
algorithms with emphasis on correct position reconstruction and spatial
resolution are presented. A subsequent two-dimensional coordinate
transformation further improves the image response of the system. Measured
images show how far the theoretical predictions of the simulations can be
verified and to what extent they can be used to improve the position
reconstruction.

diminishing idle time and significantly accelerating the execution of quantum

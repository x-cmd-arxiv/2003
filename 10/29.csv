cosmic time. These surveys have resolved more than 80% of the 0.1-10 keV X-ray
background into discrete sources. Optical spectroscopic identifications show
that the sources producing the bulk of the X-ray background are a mixture of
unobscured (type-1) and obscured (type-2) AGNs, as predicted by the XRB
population synthesis models. A class of highly luminous type-2 AGN, so called
QSO-2s, has been detected in the deepest Chandra and XMM-Newton surveys. The
new Chandra AGN redshift distribution peaks at much lower redshifts (z~0.7)
than that based on ROSAT data, and the new X-ray luminosity function indicates
that the space density of Seyfert galaxies peaks at significantly lower

applies both to absorbed and unabsorbed AGN and is also seen in the 0.5-2 keV
band alone. Previous findings of a strong dependence of the fraction of type-2

B (sdB) stars from the ESO Supernova Ia Progenitor Survey. Effective
temperature, surface gravity, and photospheric helium abundance are determined
simultaneously by spectral line profile fitting of hydrogen and helium lines,
and are found to be in agreement with previous studies of sdB stars. 24 objects
show spectral signs of a cool companion, being either companion absorption
lines or a flux contribution at Halpha. Five stars with relatively high
luminosity show peculiar Halpha profiles, possibly indicating stellar winds.
Our results are compared to recent theoretical simulations by Han et al. (2003)
for the distribution in effective temperature and surface gravity, and are
found to agree very well with these calculations. Finally we present a binary
system consisting of two helium-rich hot subdwarfs.

interstellar turbulence is still under discussion. We review the argument for
supernovae dominating in star forming regions. Magnetorotational instability
has been suggested as a way of coupling disk shear to the turbulent flow.
Models make evident that the unstable wavelengths are very long compared to
thermally unstable wavelengths, with implications for star formation in the
outer galaxy and low surface brightness disks. The perennial question of the
factors determining the hot gas filling factor in a SN-driven medium remains
open, in particular because of the unexpectedly strong turbulent mixing at the
boundaries of hot cavities seen in the models. The formation of molecular
clouds in the turbulent flow is also poorly understood. Dense regions suitable
for cloud formation clearly form even in the absence of self-gravity, although
their ultimate evolution remains to be computed.

amenable to the influence of gravitational microlensing. This study
investigates the influence on microlensing at high optical depth on a number of
current models of the Broad Line Region (BLR). It is found that the BLR can be
significantly magnified by the action of microlensing, although the degree of
magnification is dependent upon spatial and kinematic structure of the BLR.
Furthermore, while there is a correlation between the microlensing fluctuations
of the continuum source and the BLR, there is substantial scatter about this
relation, revealing that broadband photometric monitoring is not necessarily a
guide to microlensing of the BLR. The results of this study demonstrate that
the spatial and kinematic structure within the BLR may be determined via

We assess the youth of the objects by comparing them to their older

Our analysis indicates that 28 of our targets are young very low-mass objects,

with measured line equivalent widths of 120 and 35 eV respectively. The 6.4 keV
emission is the K-alpha line from near neutral Fe, whilst the 7.0 keV feature
probably originates from a blend of the neutral Fe K-beta line and the H-like
line of Fe at 6.97 keV. The relatively narrow velocity width of the K-alpha
line (<5000 km/s), its lack of response to the continuum emission on short
timescales and the detection of a neutral Compton reflection component are all
consistent with a distant origin in Compton-thick matter such as the putative
molecular torus. A strong absorption line from highly ionized iron (at 6.67
keV) is detected in the time-averaged iron line profile, whilst the depth of
the feature appears to vary with time, being strongest when the continuum flux
is higher. The iron absorption line probably arises from the highest ionization
component of the known warm absorber in NGC 3783, with an ionization of logxi=3

correlations. The iron mass is found to scale linearly with the intracluster
gas mass, implying that the global iron abundance in clusters is roughly
constant. This result suggests that enrichment mechanisms operate at a similar
rate in all clusters. By employing population synthesis and chemical enrichment
models, we show that the iron mass associated to the abundance excess which is
always found in the centre of cool core clusters can be entirely produced by
the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), which is always found at the centre of cool
core clusters. The iron mass associated to the excess, the optical magnitude of
the BCG and the temperature of the cluster are found to correlate with one
another suggesting a link between the properties of the BCG and the hosting
cluster. These observational facts lends strength to current formation theories
which envisage a strong connection between the formation of the giant BCG and

connectivity fully characterized in analytical fashion. By assuming that all
neurons have the same shape and are regularly distributed along the
two-dimensional orthogonal lattice with parameter $\Delta$, it is possible to
obtain the exact number of connections and cycles of any length from the
autoconvolution function as well as from the respective spectral density
derived from the adjacency matrix. It is shown that neuronal shape plays an
important role in defining the spatial distribution of synapses in neuronal
networks. In addition, we observe that neuromorphic networks typically exhibit
an interesting phenomenon where the pattern of connections is progressively
shifted along the spatial domain for increasing connection lengths. This is a
consequence of the fact that in neurons the axon reference point usually does
not coincide with the cell centre of mass. Morphological measurements for
characterization of the spatial distribution of connections, including the
adjacency matrix spectral density and the lacunarity of the connections, are
suggested and illustrated. We also show that Hopfield networks with
connectivity defined by different neuronal morphologies, quantified by the
proposed analytical approach, lead to distinct performace for associative
recall, as measured by the overlap index. The potential of the proposed
approach is illustrated with respect to digital images of real neuronal cells.

in each dimension. Numerics suggests that both points, $p_c$ and $p^*$, seem to
share the same $1/d$-expansion, at least for several leading orders, each
starting with $1/(2d)$. Hence, these lattice graphs have average connectivities
of $\alpha=2dp\gtrsim1$ near $p^*$ and exact graph-reduction methods become
very effective in eliminating recursively all spins of connectivity $\leq3$,
allowing the treatment of lattices of lengths up to L=30 and with up to

$\sigma(\Delta E)$ over a range of $p>p^*$ in each dimension can be combined to
reach scaling regimes of about one decade in the scaling variable
$L(p-p^*)^{\nu^*}$. Accordingly, unprecedented accuracy is obtained for the
stiffness exponents compared to undiluted lattices ($p=1$), where scaling is
far more limited. Surprisingly, scaling corrections typically are more benign

trace-freeness, are taken into account, such identities may be heavily
disguised. Tensor identities of this kind were first considered by Lovelock,
and later by Edgar and Hoeglund.

tensors possessing more symmetries, such as block symmetry W_{abcd} = W_{cdab},
or the first Bianchi identity W_{a[bcd]} = 0, we derive identities for less
structured expressions.
  These identities are important tools when studying super-energy tensors, and,
in turn, deriving identities for them. As an application we are able to show
that the Bel-Robinson tensor, the super-energy tensor for the Weyl tensor,
satisfies the equation T_{abcy}T^{abcx} = 1/4g^{x}_{y}T_{abcd}T^{abcd} in four

we are interested in how these solitons are affected by supersymmetry. We
consider both the N=1 and N=2 extensions and find that in neither case it is
possible to supersymmetrize the model without adding additional bosonic terms.
There are essentially two ways of constructing the supersymmetric theory, one
that will lead to a model which allows for solitons and another that gives a
model where solitons are excluded.
  The N=2 model is studied since extending supersymmetry is the natural way of
including topological charges in the algebra. A lower bound to the mass is
obtained by computing the central charge. The result is that it is possible to
have a non-trivial lower bound on the mass, this in principle allows for
massive solitons.

Brenner","Protein secondary structure: Entropy, correlations and prediction","8 pages, 5 figures","Bioinformatics 20:1603-1611 (2004)","10.1093/bioinformatics/bth132",,"q-bio.BM",,"  Is protein secondary structure primarily determined by local interactions
between residues closely spaced along the amino acid backbone, or by non-local
tertiary interactions? To answer this question we have measured the entropy
densities of primary structure and secondary structure sequences, and the local
inter-sequence mutual information density. We find that the important
inter-sequence interactions are short ranged, that correlations between
neighboring amino acids are essentially uninformative, and that only 1/4 of the
total information needed to determine the secondary structure is available from
local inter-sequence correlations. Since the remaining information must come
from non-local interactions, this observation supports the view that the
majority of most proteins fold via a cooperative process where secondary and
tertiary structure form concurrently. To provide a more direct comparison to
existing secondary structure prediction methods, we construct a simple hidden
Markov model (HMM) of the sequences. This HMM achieves a prediction accuracy
comparable to other single sequence secondary structure prediction algorithms,
and can extract almost all of the inter-sequence mutual information. This
suggests that these algorithms are almost optimal, and that we should not
expect a dramatic improvement in prediction accuracy. However, local
correlations between secondary and primary structure are probably of
under-appreciated importance in many tertiary structure prediction methods,
such as threading.

entangled state of two qubits, the violation of a Bell inequality implies the
possibility of an efficient secret-key extraction.

coherence time of the photons t_c is much shorter than the duration of the pump
pulse Delta t, the four photons can be described as two independent pairs. In
the opposite limit, the four photons are in a four-particle entangled state.
Any intermediate case can be characterized by a single parameter chi, which is
a function of t_c/Delta t. We present a direct measurement of chi through a
simple experimental setup. The full theoretical analysis is also provided.

its security is based on the different grounds from that of the conventional

of Y-00 protocol is equivalent to that of classical stream cipher.

separating the quantum evolution equation into Markovian and interference
terms. As a result of this separation, it is possible to show analytically that
the quadratic increase in the variance of the quantum walker's position with
time is a direct consequence of the coherence of the quantum evolution. If the
evolution is decoherent, as in the classical case, the variance is shown to
increase linearly with time, as expected. Furthermore we show that this system
has an evolution operator analogous to that of a resonant quantum kicked rotor.
As this rotator may be described through a quantum computational algorithm, one
may employ this algorithm to describe the time evolution of the quantum walker.

several thousand realizations, and therefore we organize our programs so that
the initialization cost is paid only once. The effective cost is then reduced
to a few additions per pixel multiplet (pair, triplet etc.). Further, the
algorithms waste no CPU time on computing undesired geometric configurations,
and, finally, the computations are naturally divided into independent parts,
allowing for trivial (i.e., optimal) parallelization.

the acceleration processes acting at mildly relativistic shock waves. An
essential role of oblique field configurations and field perturbations in
forming the particle energy spectrum and changing the acceleration time scale
is discussed. Then, we report on attempts to consider particle acceleration at
ultra-relativistic shocks, often yielding an asymptotic spectral index sigma =
2.2 at large shock Lorentz factors. We explain why this result is limited to
the cases of highly turbulent conditions near shocks. We conclude that our
present knowledge of the acceleration processes acting at relativistic shocks
is insufficient to allow for realistic modelling of the real shocks. The

  It was argued to imply acceleration of protons to ultra-high energy. We show
here that the ""high energy tail"" can be explained as emission from
shock-accelerated electrons in the early afterglow epoch, taking into account
the effect of synchrotron self-absorption. High energy observations set in this
case stringent constraints on model parameters: A lower limit to the total
explosion energy $E\gsim5 \times 10^{53}$ erg (assuming spherical symmetry);
  An upper limit to the density of gas surrounding the explosion,
  $n\lsim10^{-2}(E/10^{54}{\rm erg}){\rm cm}^{-3}$; A lower limit to the
expansion Lorentz factor $\Gamma_i\gsim 200$; and An upper limit to the
fraction of thermal energy carried by the magnetic field behind the shock
driven into the surrounding medium,
  $\epsilon_{B,f} <= 10^{-4}$. Such constraints can not be inferred from
keV--MeV data alone. The unusually low value of $\epsilon_{B,f}$ and the
unusually high ratio $E/n$ may account for the rareness of GRB941017-type high

Nine objects with line fluxes greater than our flux limit of 6e-18 erg/s/cm2

every 1-3 weeks for nearly 5 months, with additional observations continuing

combination with the recent compilation of Tonry et al. (2003), we calculate
cosmological parameter density contours which are consistent with the flat

that Omega_total = 1.0, we obtain best-fit values of (Omega_m,

the atmospheres of clusters of galaxies have quite complex angular and thermal

hydro-N-body simulations. Although simple in principle, these comparisons are
not always trivial. In fact, real data are convolved with the instrument
response which may substantially influence the apparent properties of the
studied features. To overcome this problem we build the software package X-MAS
devoted to simulate X-ray observations of galaxy clusters obtained from

works and discuss its application to the simulation of Chandra ACIS-S3
observations. We compare some of the main physical properties of the input data
to the ones derived from simulated observations after performing a standard
imaging and spectral analysis. We show that, if the thermal structure of the
cluster along a particular line of sight is quite complex, the projected
spectroscopic temperature obtained from the observation is significantly lower
than the emission-weighed value inferred directly from hydrodynamical
simulation. This implies that much attention must be paid in the theoretical

an important laboratory for studying massive dark objects in elliptical
galaxies and galaxy clusters by gravitational microlensing, strongly
complementing the studies of spiral galaxy halos performed in the Local Group.
We have performed a microlensing survey of M87 with the WFPC2 instrument on the

daily, we discover seven variable sources. Four are variable stars of some
sort, two are consistent with classical novae, and one exhibits an excellent
microlensing lightcurve, though with a very blue color implying the somewhat
disfavored possibility of a horizontal branch source being lensed. Based on
sensitivity calculations from artificial stars and from artificial lightcurves,
we estimate the expected microlensing rate. We find that the detection of one
event is consistent with a dark halo with a 20% contribution of microlensing
objects for both M87 and the Virgo Cluster, similar to the value found from
observations in the Local Group. Further work is required to test the

by solving the equations for conservation of mass and momentum with prescribed

temperature anisotropy is strong and the associated mirror force plays an
important role in driving the fast solar wind; the critical point where the
outflow velocity equals the parallel sound speed is reached already at 1.5 Rsun
from Sun center. The slow wind arises from a region with open field lines and
weak anisotropy surrounding the equatorial streamer belt. The model parameters
were chosen to reproduce the observed latitudinal extent of the equatorial
streamer in the corona and at large distance from the Sun. We find that the
magnetic cusp of the closed-field streamer core lies at about 1.95 Rsun. The
transition from fast to slow wind is due to a decrease in temperature
anisotropy combined with the non-monotonic behavior of the non-radial expansion
factor in flow tubes that pass near the streamer cusp. In the slow wind, the
plasma beta is of order unity and the critical point lies at about 5 Rsun, well
beyond the magnetic cusp. The predicted outflow velocities are consistent with
OVI Doppler dimming measurements from UVCS/SOHO. We also find good agreement
with polarized brightness (pB) measurements from LASCO/SOHO and HI Ly-alpha

of large amounts of gas in the central regions of merging galaxies. N-body
simulations have shown that the coalescence of a massive black hole binary
eventually stalls in a stellar background. However, our simulations suggest
that the massive black hole binary will finally merge if it is embedded in a
gaseous background. Here we present results in which the gas is assumed to be
initially spherical with a relatively smooth distribution. In the early
evolution of the binary, the separation dimishes due to the gravitational drag
exerted by the background gas. In the later stages, when the binary dominates
the gravitational potential in its vicinity, the medium responds by forming an
ellipsoidal density enhancement whose axis lags behind the binary axis, and
this offset produces a torque on the binary that causes continuing loss of
angular momentum and is able to reduce the binary separation to distances where
gravitational radiation is efficient. Assuming typical parameters from
observations of Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies, we predict that a black hole
binary will merge within $10^{7}$yrs; therefore these results imply that in a
merger of gas-rich galaxies, any massive central black holes will coalescence
soon after the galaxies merge. Our work thus supports scenarios of massive
black hole evolution and growth where hierarchical merging plays an important
role. The final coalescence of the black holes leads to gravitational radiation
emission that would be detectable up to high redshift by LISA. We show that
similar physical effects are important for the formation of close binary stars.

find several quantitative differences between the AXP and SGR bursts.
Specifically, the AXP bursts we observed exhibit a wider range of durations,
the correlation between burst fluence and duration is flatter than for SGRs,
the observed AXP bursts are on average less energetic than observed SGR bursts,
and the more energetic AXP bursts have the hardest spectra -- the opposite of
what is seen for SGRs. We conclude that the bursts are sufficiently similar

This may either be a fundamental upper mass limit which is defined by the
physics of massive stars and/or their formation, or it may simply reflect the
increasing sparsity of such very massive stars so that observing even
higher-mass stars becomes unlikely in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. It
is shown here that if the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is a power-law
with a Salpeter exponent (alpha=2.35) for massive stars then the richest very

consistently incorporating a fundamental upper mass limit then the observed
upper mass limit is arrived at readily even if the IMF is invariant. An
explicit turn-down or cutoff of the IMF near 150Msun is not required; our

parameters of short GRBs confirm, as expected from previous works based on the
hardness ratio, that they are harder than long events, we find that this
difference is mainly due to a harder low energy spectral component present in
short bursts, rather than to a (marginally) different peak energy. Intriguingly
our analysis also reveals that the emission properties of short GRBs are
similar to the first 2 s of long events. This might suggest that the central
engine of long and short GRBs is the same, just working for a longer time for
long GRBs. We find that short bursts do not obey the correlation between peak
frequency and isotropic emitted energy for any assumed redshift, while they can
obey the similar correlation between the peak frequency and isotropic emitted
luminosity. This is consistent with (although not a proof of) the idea that
short GRBs emit a $\gamma$--ray luminosity similar to long GRBs. If they indeed
obey the peak frequency -- isotropic luminosity relation, we can estimate the
redshift distribution of short bursts, which turns out to be consistent with
that of long bursts just with a slightly smaller average redshift.

K in 2001 October, shortly after the steady decline of the system began, to
15,900 K 17 months later. The UV flux in 2003 March was still 2.4 times higher
than measured prior to the outburst and so the system was still recovering from
the outburst. During this period, the shape of the spectrum and the flux from
the system are consistent with a log g=8.5, 0.9 solar mass white dwarf at the
astrometrically-determined distance to WZ Sge. Although the spectrum from 2001
September resembles that of a white dwarf with a temperature of 28,200 K, the
implied radius is smaller than in the remainder of the observations. If the
entire white dwarf was visible in 2001 September, then either a second
component, such as the disk emission, was distorting the spectrum, or more
likely, the temperature on the white dwarf photosphere was not uniform then.
The metal lines in the spectra of WZ Sge have weakened with time. Model fits
that allow for material along the line of sight to the white dwarf photosphere
are substantial improvements over models which assume all the lines arise from

galaxies, with morphological type betweens S0 and Sab and absolute magnitudes
M_B between -18 and -22; they form the massive and high-surface brightness
extreme of the disk galaxy population. Our study is designed to investigate the
relation between dark and luminous matter in these systems, of which very
little yet is known.
  From a combination of WSRT HI observations and long-slit optical spectra, we
have obtained high-quality rotation curves. The rotation velocities always rise
very fast in the center; in the outer regions, they are often declining, with
the outermost measured velocity 10-25% lower than the maximum.
  We decompose the rotation curves into contributions from the luminous
(stellar and gaseous) and dark matter. The stellar disks and bulges always
dominate the rotation curves within the inner few disk scale lengths, and are
responsible for the decline in the outer parts. As an example, we present here
the decompositions for UGC 9133. We are able to put tight upper and lower
limits on the stellar mass-to-light ratios.

simulations of self-gravitating magnetized tori, subject in particular to the
influence of the magnetorotational instability (MRI). In this work, paper I, we
restrict our calculations to the study of the axisymmetric evolution of such
tori. Our goals are twofold: (1) to investigate how self-gravity influences the
global structure and evolution of the disks; and (2) to determine whether
turbulent density inhomogeneities can be enhanced by self-gravity in this
regime.
  As in non self-gravitating models, the linear growth of the MRI is followed
by a turbulent phase during which angular momentum is transported outward. As a
result, self-gravitating tori quickly develop a dual structure composed of an
inner thin Keplerian disk fed by a thicker self-gravitating disk, whose
rotation profile is close to a Mestel disk. Our results show that the effects
of self-gravity enhance density fluctuations much less than they smooth the
disk, and giving it more coherence. We discuss the expected changes that will
occur in 3D simulations, the results of which are presented in a companion
paper.

  from the Infrared Calcium Triplet","36 pages, 19 figures, to appear in Astronomical Journal, January 2004",,"10.1086/380608",,"astro-ph",,"  Near infrared spectra were obtained for 117 red giants in the Fornax dwarf
spheroidal galaxy with the FORS1 spectrograph on the VLT, in order to study the
metallicity distribution of the stars and to lift the age-metallicity
degeneracy of the red giant branch (RGB) in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD).
Metallicities are derived from the equivalent widths of the infrared Calcium
triplet lines at 8498, 8542, and 8662 A, calibrated with data from globular
clusters, the open cluster M67 and the LMC. For a substantial portion of the
sample, the strength of the Calcium triplet is unexpectedly high, clearly
indicating that the main stellar population of Fornax is significantly more
metal-rich than could be inferred from the position of its RGB in the CMD. We
show that the relative narrowness of the RGB in Fornax is caused by the
superposition of stars of very different ages and metallicities. The
metallicity distribution in Fornax is centered at [Fe/H]= -0.9, with a
metal-poor tail extending to [Fe/H] ~= -2. While the distribution to higher
metallicities is less well determined by our observations, the comparison with
LMC data indicates that it extends to [Fe/H] ~ -0.4. By comparing the
metallicities of the stars with their positions in the CMD, we have derived the
complex age-metallicity relation of Fornax. In the first few Gyr, the metal
abundance rose to [Fe/H] ~ -1.0 dex. The enrichment accelerated in the past ~
1-4 Gyr to reach [Fe/H] ~ -0.4 dex. More than half the sample is constituted of
star younger than ~ 4 Gyr, thus indicating sustained recent star formation in
Fornax. These results indicate that the capacity of dwarf spheroidal galaxies
to retain the heavy elements that they produce is larger than expected.

formation that is triggered by the passage of Sgr through the Galactic disc,
both in Sgr and in the disc. This scenario has also the virtue of explaining
the mysterious ``bulge C stars'' as disc stars formed in this event. The
interaction of Sgr with the Milky Way is likely to have played a major role in

the constraint that the magnetization of each hexagon is $\pm 6$ or 0. For
ferromagnetic interactions, we find that the system is critical for a range of
temperatures (critical line) that terminates when it undergoes an exotic first
order phase transition with a jump from a zero magnetization state into the
fully magnetized state at finite temperature. Dynamically, however, we find
that the system becomes frozen into domains. The domain walls are made of
perfectly straight segments, and domain growth appears frozen within the time
scales studied with Monte Carlo simulations. This dynamical obstruction has its
origin in the topology of the allowed reconfigurations in phase space, which
consist of updates of closed loops of spins. As a consequence of the dynamical
obstruction, there exists a dynamical temperature, lower than the (avoided)
static critical temperature, at which the system is seen to jump from a
``supercooled liquid'' to a ``polycrystalline'' phase. In contrast, for

the ranges of electron densities and device geometries in which they exist.
They can occur in clean Si MOSFETs in the range of densities in which an
``apparent metal to insulator transition'' has been observed in existing

operation. The results show that a small change in the number of doping
impurities or in the position of a single discrete impurity in the inversion
layer may significantly influence the drain current. This effect is not only
related to threshold voltage fluctuations but also to variations in transport
properties in the inversion layer, especially at high drain voltage. The
results are analyzed in terms of local fluctuations of electron velocity and
current density. In a set of fifteen simulated devices the drive current Ion,
determined at VGS = VDS = 0.6 V, is found to vary in a range of 23% according
to the position of channel impurities.

This entanglement dynamics is employed for a precision measurement of atomic

M_\odot$) black holes (MBHs) are potentially an important source for LISA, the
proposed space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detector. The orbits of the
inspiraling COs are highly complicated; they can remain rather eccentric up
until the final plunge, and display extreme versions of relativistic perihelion
precession and Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital plane. The strongest
capture signals will be ~10 times weaker than LISA's instrumental noise, but in
principle (with sufficient computing power) they can be disentangled from the
noise by matched filtering. The associated template waveforms are not yet in
hand, but theorists will very likely be able to provide them before LISA
launches. Here we introduce a family of approximate (post-Newtonian) capture
waveforms, given in (nearly) analytic form, for use in advancing LISA studies
until more accurate versions are available. Our model waveforms include most of
the key qualitative features of true waveforms, and cover the full space of
capture-event parameters (including orbital eccentricity and the MBH's spin).
Here we use our approximate waveforms to (i) estimate the relative
contributions of different harmonics (of the orbital frequency) to the total
signal-to-noise ratio, and (ii) estimate the accuracy with which LISA will be
able to extract the physical parameters of the capture event from the measured
waveform. For a typical source (a $10 M_\odot$ CO captured by a $10^6 M_\odot$
MBH at a signal-to-noise ratio of 30), we find that LISA can determine the MBH
and CO masses to within a fractional error of $\sim 10^{-4}$, measure $S/M^2$

symmetric global monopole in $(D=d+2)$-dimensional general relativity. Some
common features of monopole solutions are found independently of the choice of
the symmetry-breaking potential. Thus, the solutions show six types of
qualitative behavior and can contain at most one simple horizon. For the
standard Mexican hat potential, we analytically find the $D$-dependent range of
$\gamma$ (the gravitational field strength parameter) in which there exist
globally regular solutions with a monotonically growing Higgs field, containing
a horizon and a Kantowski-Sachs (KS) cosmology outside it, where the topology
of spatial sections is $\R\times \S^d$. Their cosmological properties favor the
idea that the standard Big Bang might be replaced with a nonsingular static
core and a horizon appearing as a result of some symmetry-breaking phase
transition on the Planck energy scale. We have also found families of new
solutions with an oscillating Higgs field, parametrized by the number of its
knots. All such solutions describe space-times of finite size, possessing a
regular center, a horizon and a singularity beyond it.

excluded by the data. Starting from a description of the source's spacetime
expansion based on gross thermodynamical properties of hot matter (which is
able to describe a number of experimental observables), we introduce the pion
emission function with a contribution from continuous emission during the

by calculating the HBT parameters R_out and R_side. The results are compared

We achieve agreement with data, provided that some minor modifications of the
fireball evolution scenario are made and find that the parameter R_out is not
sensitive to the fireball lifetime, but only to the duration of the final
breakup, in spite of the fact that emission takes place throughout the whole
lifetime. We explicitly demonstrate that those findings do not alter previous

field theory in the singular limit. The finiteness of the energy density of the
solution is an important issue, but possible conformal anomaly resulting from
the twisting has prevented us from addressing this problem. We present a
description of the twisted regulated butterfly state in terms of a conformal
field theory with a vanishing central charge which consists of the ordinary bc
ghosts and a matter system with c=26. Various quantities relevant to vacuum
string field theory are computed exactly using this description. We find that
the energy density of the solution can be finite in the limit, but the
finiteness depends on the subleading structure of vacuum string field theory.
We further argue, contrary to our previous expectation, that contributions from
subleading terms in the kinetic term to the energy density can be of the same
order as the contribution from the leading term which consists of the midpoint
ghost insertion.

replica limit of the Toda lattice equation. We consider both Hermitian and
non-Hermitian theories in the Wigner-Dyson universality class (class A) and in
the chiral universality class (class AIII). In the Hermitian case we rederive
two-point correlation functions for class A and class AIII as well as several
one-point correlation functions in class AIII. In the non-Hermitian case the
spectral density of non-Hermitian complex random matrices in the weak
non-Hermiticity limit is obtained directly from the replica limit of the Toda
lattice equation. In the case of class A, this result describes the spectral
density of a disordered system in a constant imaginary vector potential (the
Hatano-Nelson model) which is known from earlier work. New results are obtained
for the spectral density in the weak non-Hermiticity limit of a quenched chiral
random matrix model at nonzero chemical potential. These results apply to the
ergodic or $\epsilon$ domain of quenched QCD at nonzero chemical potential. The
spectral density obtained is different from the result derived by Akemann for a
closely related model, which is given by the leading order asymptotic expansion
of our result. In all cases, the replica limit of the Toda lattice equation
explains the factorization of spectral one- and two-point functions into a
product of a bosonic (noncompact integral) and a fermionic (compact integral)
partition function. We conclude that the fermionic, the bosonic and the
supersymmetric partition functions are all part of a single integrable
hierarchy. This is the reason that it is possible to obtain the supersymmetric
partition function, and its derivatives, from the replica limit of the Toda
lattice equation.

  Mechanics on 23 September 2003 (submission no. WRY 122)",,,,"nlin.CD",,"  The present work discusses about a possible physical interpretation of the
occurrence of turbulence in a dynamic fluid with mathematical modeling and
computer simulation. Here turbulence is defined to be a phenomenon of random
velocity field in the space-time continuum accompanied by chaotic occurrence of
vortices. This interpretation is independent of the Navier-Stokes equations. I
have reasoned how individual fluid percels are disintegrated with increasing
Reynolds number (Re) (or increasing velocity or decreasing viscosity or both)
leading to creation of smaller parcels with arbitrary speeds in arbitrary
directions, which destroys the laminar structure of the fluid flow. I have
modeled the occurrence of a vortex as a result of collision among fluid jets
under certain conditions. Chaotic occurrence of such vortices further
randomizes the velocity field. These together ultimately lead to turbulence. I
have also shown an application of vortex formation in a dynamic fluid in
atmospheric science., where it has been shown how an initial dusturbing
cyclonic vortex is created by collision between two linear wind jets under
certain conditions, which under favorable conditions, may mature into a severe
tropical storm. Then a three dimensional mathematical modeling of the vortex
(assuming that it is going to become a matured storm) has been proposed with
computer simulations. This helps us to understand the mystery of origin of
cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices in atmosphere and some of their observed
asymmetries.

enough for a conclusive comparison with the ChPT calculation and is in

fit experimental data on near threshold behaviour of the cross sections and the

biopolymers with a specific phenotype, that originated from a given genotypic
sequence by a single mutational event. Depending on the ratio g0 that
characterizes the spread of potential energies of the mutated population with
respect to temperature, three different statistical regimes have been
identified. We suggest that biopolymers found in nature are in a critical
regime with g0 in the range 1-6, corresponding to a broad, but not too broad,
phenotypic distribution resembling a truncated Levy flight. Thus the biopolymer
phenotype can be considerably modified in just a few mutations. The proposed
model is in good agreement with the experimental distribution of activities
determined for a population of single mutants of a group I ribozyme.

the most important, perhaps, is its role in transmitting electrical impulses
along the nerve. Understanding its hydration structure and thermodynamics is
crucial in dissecting its role in such processes. Her we address these
questions using both the statistical mechanical quasi-chemical theory of
solutions and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations predict an
interesting hydration structure for K+(aq): the population of about six (6)
water molecules within the initial minimum of the observed g_{KO}(r) at
infinite dilution involves four (4) inner-most molecules that the
quasi-chemical theory suggests should be taken as the theoretical inner shell.
The contribution of the 5th and 6th closest water molecules is observable as a
distinct shoulder on the principal maximum of the g_{KO}(r). The quasi-chemical
estimate of solvation free energy for the neutral pair KOH is also in good
agreement with experiments.

indicated in this paper. For a N electrons system with Heisenberg exchange
integral, the correct exchange Hamilton should be of two terms, not only one as
in the previous magnetism theories. The role of the minor term in the exchange
Hamilton was considered. Based on the principle of superposition of state, the
eigenstate of the system with Heisenberg exchange integral, the sum of a
positive term and a negative term, and the energy (relative to exchange
interaction) eigenvalue were attained. When the positive term is equal to the
absolute value of the negative term, the system is in the spin glass state, the
probabilities of parallel and antiparallel arrange for every pair of spins of
electron of nearest neighbours in the system are equal. When the positive term
is not equal to the absolute value of the negative term,the probabilities are
not equal, and there coexist the ferromagnetic states and spin glass or
antiferromagnetic state and spin glass,when ferromagnetic states and spin glass
or antiferromagnetic state and spin glass coexist, the energy of the system is
lower than that when only ferromagnetic states or antiferromagnetic state
exists as in previous theory. Weiss ferromagnetic state or Neel anti
ferromagnetic state is just a special state as the positive term is equal to
zero or negative term is equal to zero.

the possible unknown states but work out a ``typical'' probability distribution
on the set of states, as implied by the experimental data. As a consequence,
any measure of knowledge about the unknown state and thus any notion of ``best
strategy'' (i.e. the choice of observables to be measured, and the number of
times they are measured) depend on the unknown state. By learning from
previously obtained data, the experimentalist re-adjusts the observable to be
measured in the next step, eventually approaching an optimal strategy. We
consider two measures of knowledge and exhibit all ``best'' strategies for the
case of a two-dimensional Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss some features of
the problem in higher dimensions and in the infinite dimensional case.

for small values of N. We complete a previous work by Aguilar and Merritt
concerning the morphological segregation between spherical and elliptical
equilibria. We find and interpret two new segregations: one concerns the
equilibrium core size and the other the equilibrium temperature. All these
features are used to explain some of the global properties of self-gravitating
objects: origin of globular clusters and central black hole or shape of
elliptical galaxies.

solve the equations describing stationary axisymmetric configurations in
general relativity coupled to a finite temperature, relativistic equation of
state, to obtain a sequence of quasi-equilibrium configurations describing the
evolution of newly born neutron stars. Our estimates show that the scale of
variation of the angular velocity in a PNSs is of the order of 7-10 km. We
obtain the maximum rotation frequency that can be reached as the protoneutron
stars deleptonizes and cools down, as well as other relevant parameters such as
total angular momentum or |T/W|. Our study shows that imposing physical
constraints (conservation of baryonic mass and angular momentum) and choosing
reasonable thermodynamical profiles as the star evolves gives results
consistent with the energetics of more complex simulations of non-rotating
PNSs. It appears to be unlikely that PNSs formed in nearly axisymmetric core
collapse reach the critical angular velocity to undergo the bar mode
instability. They could, however, undergo secular or low |T/W| rotational
instabilities a few seconds after birth, resulting in a strong emission of
gravitational waves retarded with respect to the neutrino luminosity peak. We
also found that the geometry of strongly differentially rotating protoneutron
stars can become toroidal-like for large values of the angular velocity, before
reaching the mass shedding limit.

The synthetic spectral fits to the data indicate a cooling in response to the

cooling time scale tau (of the white dwarf temperature excess) is of the order

about 850 days toward the end of the second year following the outburst.
  In the present work, we numerically model the accretional heating and
subsequent cooling of the accreting white dwarf in WZ Sge. The best
compressional heating model fit is obtained for a 1.2 Msun white dwarf
accreting at a rate of 9.E-9 Msun/yr for 52 days. However, if one assumes a
lower mass accretion rate or a lower white dwarf mass, then compressional
heating alone cannot account for the observed temperature decline, and other
sources of heating have to be included to increase the temperature of the model
to the observed value. We quantitatively check the effect of boundary layer
irradiation as such an additional source.

interactions with the diffuse IR background, yielding $e^\pm$ pairs. The
resulting $e^\pm$ pairs generate one hitherto undiscovered GeV emission by
inverse Compton scattering with the cosmic microwave background photons
(CMBPs). We study such emission by taking the 1998-2000 CAT data, the
reanalyzed 1999 & 2000 HEGRA data and the corresponding intrinsic spectra
proposed by Aharonian et al. (2003a). We numerically calculate the scattered
photon spectra for different intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) strengths. If
the IGMF is about $10^{-18}{\rm G}$ or weaker, there comes very strong GeV
emission, whose flux is far above the detection sensitivity of the upcoming
satellite GLAST! Considered its relatively high redshift ($z=0.129$), the
detected GeV emission in turn provides us a valuable chance to calibrate the
poor known spectral energy distribution of the intergalactic infrared
background, or provides us some reliable constraints on the poorly known IGMF
strength.

are currently being used to discriminate pulsation modes in order to facilitate
mode identification of kappa-driven non-radial pulsating stars. In addition to
physical inputs (e.g., mass, T_eff, etc.), these quantities depend on the
non-adiabatic treatment of the atmosphere. This paper presents theoretical
results concerning Delta Scuti pulsating stars. The envelope of each of these
stellar structures possesses a convection zone whose development is determined
by various factors. An interacting pulsation-atmosphere physical treatment is
introduced which supplies two basic non-adiabatic physical quantities: the
relative effective temperature variation and the phase lag phi^T, defined as
the angle between effective temperature variations and radial displacement.
These quantities can be used to derive the phase differences and amplitude
ratios. Numerical values for these quantities depend critically on the alpha
MLT parameter used to calculate the convection in the envelope. The dependence
on alpha was analized and it was found that the use of colour observations may
be of considerable importance in testing the MLT. Finally, examples are given
of how alpha introduces uncertainties in the theoretical predictions regarding
phases and amplitudes of photometric variations in Delta Scuti pulsating stars.

particular attention to nonlinear effects. Under the approximation that the
joint distribution of the LG acceleration and velocity is Gaussian, two
quantities describing nonlinear effects enter these analyses. The first one is
the coherence function, i.e. the cross-correlation coefficient of the Fourier
modes of gravity and velocity fields. The second one is the ratio of velocity
power spectrum to gravity power spectrum. To date, in all analyses of the LG
acceleration the second quantity was not accounted for. Extending our previous
work, we study both the coherence function and the ratio of the power spectra.
With the aid of numerical simulations we obtain expressions for the two as
functions of wavevector and sigma_8. Adopting WMAP's best determination of
sigma_8, we estimate the most likely value of the parameter beta and its
errors. As the observed values of the LG velocity and gravity, we adopt
respectively a CMB-based estimate of the LG velocity, and Schmoldt et al.'s
(1999) estimate of the LG acceleration from the PSCz catalog. We obtain beta =
0.66^{+0.21}_{-0.07}; thus our errorbars are significantly smaller than those
of Schmoldt et al. This is not surprising, because the coherence function they
used greatly overestimates actual decoherence between nonlinear gravity and

developed by Pons et al. (1999; 2001) that describe how a non rotating star
cools down and contracts while neutrino diffusion and thermalization processes
dominate the stellar dynamics. For assigned values of the evolution time, we
set the star into slow rotation and integrate the equations of stellar
perturbations in the Cowling approximation, both in the time domain and in the
frequency domain, to find the quasi-normal mode frequencies. We study the
secular instability of the g-modes, that are present in the oscillation

dynamical time scales of cluster lenses, which arise on time scales which are
of order a Gyr. In this case study, we first describe qualitatively with an
analytic model how some of the lensing properties of clusters are expected to
change during merging events. We then analyse a numerically simulated lens
model for the variation in its efficiency for producing both tangential and
radial arcs while a massive substructure falls onto the main cluster body. We
find that: (1) during the merger, the shape of the critical lines and caustics
changes substantially; (2) the lensing cross sections for long and thin arcs
can grow by one order of magnitude and reach their maxima when the extent of
the critical curves is largest; (3) the cross section for radial arcs also
grows, but the cluster can efficiently produce this kind of arcs only while the
merging substructure crosses the main cluster centre; (4) while the arc cross
sections pass through their maxima as the merger proceeds, the cluster's X-ray
emission increases by a factor of $\sim5$. Thus, we conclude that accounting
for these dynamical processes is very important for arc statistics studies. In
particular, they may provide a possible explanation for the arc statistics
problem.

treatment of the atomic interactions (Tersoff potentials), all three parameters
are favorable for the self-assembly of DVs on the Si(001) surface rather than
on Ge(001). The most significant difference between the defects on Si(001) and

efforts to achieve an understanding of the two different types of transport
measurements (which we refer to as drag and tunneling experiments respectively)

Eisenstein at the California Institute of Technology. In a drag experiment,
current is sent through one of the two-layers and the voltage drop is measured
in the other layer. We will argue that the finding of these experiments that
the voltage drop in the drag layer is different from that in the the drive
layer, is an experimental proof that these bilayers do not have
quasi-long-range excitonic order. The property that at $\nu=1$ the longitudinal
drag voltage increases from near zero when spontaneous coherence is initially
established, then falls back toward zero as it becomes well established, can be
explained as a competition between the broken symmetry and the gap to which it
gives rise. In the tunneling experiment, current is injected in one layer and
removed from the other layer. The absence of quasi-long-range order likely
explains the relatively small tunneling conductance per area found in the these
measurements.

Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a harmonic trap and an optical lattice.
The harmonic trap induces a dynamical instability of the soliton, culminating
in sound emission. The presence of the optical lattice enhances the
instability, and in addition, dephases the emitted sound waves, thus preventing
stabilisation of the soliton by sound reabsorption. This instability can be
probed experimentally by monitoring the soliton oscillations under various
lattice configurations, which can be realised by changing the intensity and
angle between the laser beams that form the lattice. For short enough times,
such that the emitted sound does not reinteract with the soliton, the power
emitted by the soliton is found to be proportional to the square of the local

equilibrium spin-spin correlator and above their roughening temperature, the
field-cooled susceptibility $\chi_{\rm FC}(t)-\chi_0\sim t^{-A}$ where $\chi_0$
is related to the equilibrium magnetization and the exponent A is related to
the time-dependent scaling of the interface width between ordered domains. The
same effect also dominates the scaling of the zero-field-cooled susceptibility
$\chi_{\rm ZFC}(t,s)$, but does not enter into the thermoremanent
susceptibility $\rho_{\rm TRM}(t,s)$. However, there may be large finite-time
corrections to the scaling of $\rho_{\rm TRM}(t,s)$ which are explicitly
derived and may be needed in order to extract reliable ageing exponents.
Consistency with the predictions of local scale invariance is confirmed in the
Glauber-Ising and spherical models.

displays relevant changes and eventually the onset of a glassy regime. This has
been interpreted in terms of a crossover to dynamics more typical of colloidal

applications. One of the most popular MPI implementations is MPICH. Its
successor, MPICH2, features a completely new design that provides more
performance and flexibility. To ensure portability, it has a hierarchical
structure based on which porting can be done at different levels. In this
paper, we present our experiences designing and implementing MPICH2 over
InfiniBand. Because of its high performance and open standard, InfiniBand is
gaining popularity in the area of high-performance computing. Our study focuses
on optimizing the performance of MPI-1 functions in MPICH2. One of our
objectives is to exploit Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) in Infiniband to
achieve high performance. We have based our design on the RDMA Channel
interface provided by MPICH2, which encapsulates architecture-dependent
communication functionalities into a very small set of functions. Starting with
a basic design, we apply different optimizations and also propose a
zero-copy-based design. We characterize the impact of our optimizations and
designs using microbenchmarks. We have also performed an application-level
evaluation using the NAS Parallel Benchmarks. Our optimized MPICH2
implementation achieves 7.6 $\mu$s latency and 857 MB/s bandwidth, which are
close to the raw performance of the underlying InfiniBand layer. Our study
shows that the RDMA Channel interface in MPICH2 provides a simple, yet
powerful, abstraction that enables implementations with high performance by
exploiting RDMA operations in InfiniBand. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first high-performance design and implementation of MPICH2 on InfiniBand
using RDMA support.

many-body systems through noncommutative algebraic geometry. The Calogero-Moser
systems have a natural geometric interpretation as flows on spaces of spectral
curves on a ruled surface. We explain how the meromorphic solutions of the KP
hierarchy have an interpretation via a noncommutative ruled surface. Namely, we
identify KP Lax operators with vector bundles on quantized cotangent spaces
(formulated technically in terms of D-modules). A geometric duality (a variant
of the Fourier-Mukai transform) then identifies the parameter space for such
vector bundles with that for the spectral curves and sends the KP flows to the
Calogero-Moser flows. It follows that the motion and collisions of the poles of
the rational, trigonometric, and elliptic solutions of the KP hierarchy, as
well as of its multicomponent analogs, are governed by the (spin)
Calogero-Moser systems on cuspidal, nodal, and smooth genus one curves. This
provides a geometric explanation and generalizations of results of
Airault-McKean-Moser, Krichever, and Wilson.

there are new transversely polarized states previously excluded), so the model
is exactly soluable. However, significant differences arise when the model is
applied to electromagnetic interactions. After reviewing the strongly

dimensional form. Therefore corresponding relativistic covariant equations are
three-dimensional from the beginning. The solutions of the considered equations
satisfy automatically the unitarity condition and for the leptons these
equations are exactly gauge invariant even after the truncation over the
multiparticle ($n>3$) intermediate states. Moreover, the form of these
three-body equations does not depend on the choice of the model Lagrangian and
it is the same for the formulations with and without quark degrees of freedom.
The effective potential of the suggested equations is defined by the vertex
functions with two on-mass shell particles. It is emphasized that these INPUT
vertex functions can be constructed from experimental data.
  Special attention is given to the comparison with the three-body Faddeev
equations. Unlike to these equations, the suggested three-body equation have
the form of the Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations with the connected potential.
In addition, the microscopical potential of the suggested equations contains
the contributions from the three-body forces and from the particle creation
(annihilation) mechanism on the one external particles. The structure of the
three-body forces, appearing in the considered field-theoretical formulation,

as a function of $\theta$, the angle between the axis of symmetry and the
vertical axis, and find the existence of the critical angle $\theta_c$. When
the bodies are spun with an initial angle $\theta_{\rm initial}>\theta_c$,
$\theta$ will increase to $\pi$, implying that the body will spin at the thin
end. Alternatively, if $\theta_{\rm initial}<\theta_c$, then $\theta$ will
decrease. For some oval curves, $\theta$ will reduce to 0 and the corresponding
bodies will spin at the fat end. For other oval curves, a fixed point at
$\theta_f$ is predicted, where $0 <\theta_f< \theta_c$. Then the bodies will
spin not at the fat end, but at a new stable point with $\theta_f$. The
empirical fact that eggs more often spin at the fat than at the thin end is

pronounced are the ordinary ""past-present-future,"" ""present-only""

the remaining types represent an intriguing superposition of the three.
Concerning space, the most elementary are the ordinary, i.e. ""here-and-there,""

families, the best alternative is to compare orthologous family members among
several closely-related species with varying degrees of reproductive isolation.
Using RT-PCR we show that in pea (Pisum sativum) each member of the
pathogenesis-related PR10 family has a distinct pattern of expression in
response to the fungus Fusarium solani, and in treatment with salicylic acid,
chitosan and abcisic acid. Sequencing reveals that PR10.1, PR10.2 and PR10.3
exist in P. humile, P. elatius and P. fulvum, except that no PR10.2 orthologue
was identified in P. elatius. PR10.1, PR10.2 and PR10.3 appear to have diverged
from a single gene in the common Pisum ancestor. For the recently diverged
PR10.1 and PR10.2, the timing of fungal-induced expression differs greatly
among species. For example, PR10.1 was strongly induced in P. sativum by F.
solani within 8 hours postinoculation (h.p.i.), whereas little PR10.1
expression was seen in pea's closest relative, P. humile, and in the more
distantly-related P. elatius. In P. fulvum, expression did not peak until 48
h.p.i. Expression of the more ancient PR10.4 and PR10.5 genes is more tightly
conserved among Pisum species. These data indicate that expression, as well as
sequence, can evolve rapidly. We hypothesize that changes in differential
expression of multigene family members could provide a source of phenotypic
diversity in populations, which may be of particular importance to
plant/pathogen coevolution.

  Supplementary material available from the authors","BMC Bioinformatics. 2004 May 11;5(1):57",,,"q-bio.GN",,"  BACKGROUND: Transcriptional regulation is a key mechanism in the functioning
of the cell, and is mostly effected through transcription factors binding to
specific recognition motifs located upstream of the coding region of the
regulated gene. The computational identification of such motifs is made easier
by the fact that they often appear several times in the upstream region of the
regulated genes, so that the number of occurrences of relevant motifs is often
significantly larger than expected by pure chance. RESULTS: To exploit this
fact, we construct sets of genes characterized by the statistical
overrepresentation of a certain motif in their upstream regions. Then we study
the functional characterization of these sets by analyzing their annotation to
Gene Ontology terms. For the sets showing a statistically significant specific
functional characterization, we conjecture that the upstream motif
characterizing the set is a binding site for a transcription factor involved in
the regulation of the genes in the set. CONCLUSIONS: The method we propose is
able to identify many known binding sites in S. cerevisiae and new candidate
targets of regulation by known transcription factors. Its application to less
well studied organisms is likely to be valuable in the exploration of their
regulatory interaction network.

obtained independently, by claiming a plausible dynamical robustness of

and a global unitary transformation of the state of two entangled spatially

due to measurement is valid, the no FTLS condition is saved if we do not have
physical access to the required global unitary transformation. This means that
the no FTLS condition is also present on the operational level, namely as
imposing a physical restriction on the possible realizable unitary
transformations, in this case of two entangled but spatially separated spin
1/2.

we simulate a model in which quasars are the dominant sources of radiation. We
make use of large scale N-body simulations of a LambdaCDM universe, and include
such effects as finite quasar lifetimes and output on the lightcone, which
affects the shape of quasar light echoes. We create Lya forest spectra that
would be generated in the presence of such a fluctuating radiation field,
finding that the power spectrum of the Lya forest can be suppressed by as much
as 15 % for modes with k=0.05-1 Mpc/h. This relatively small effect may have
consequences for high precision measurements of the Lya power spectrum on
larger scales than have yet been published. We also investigate another
radiation field probe, the cross-correlation of quasar positions and the Lya
forest. For both quasar lifetimes which we simulate (10^7 yr and 10^8 yr), we
expect to see a strong decrease in the Lya absorption close to other quasars
(the ``foreground'' proximity effect). We then use data from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey First Data Release to make an observational determination of this
statistic. We find no sign of our predicted lack of absorption, but instead
increased absorption close to quasars. If the bursts of radiation from quasars
last on average < 10^6 yr, then we would not expect to be able to see the
foreground effect. However, the strength of the absorption itself seems to be
indicative of rare objects, and hence much longer total times of emission per
quasar. Variability of quasars in bursts with timescales > 10^4yr and < 10^6 yr
could reconcile these two facts.

the stars in a single velocity-space moving group have a wide range of ages, a

proven to be a powerful tool to study the mass distribution in the universe.
The advent of panoramic cameras on 4m class telescope has led to a first
generation of surveys that already compete with large redshift surveys in terms
of the accuracy with which cosmological parameters can be determined. The next
surveys, which already have started taking data, will provide another major
step forward. At the current level, systematics appear under control, and it is
expected that weak lensing will develop into a key tool in the era of precision
cosmology, provided we improve our knowledge of the non-linear matter power
spectrum and the source redshift distribution. In this review we will briefly
describe the principles of weak lensing and discuss the results of recent
cosmic shear surveys. We show how the combination of weak lensing and cosmic
microwave background measurements can provide tight constraints on cosmological
parameters. We also demonstrate the usefulness of weak lensing in studies of
the relation between the galaxy distribution and the underlying dark matter
distribution (``galaxy biasing''), which can provide important constraints on
models of galaxy formation. Finally, we discuss new and upcoming large cosmic

the redshift survey that we can measure the three parameters A_g, Gamma and
beta to about 3% accuracy, but will not be able to detect the baryon abundance,
or the matter-galaxy correlation coefficient, r_g. The peculiar velocity survey
will jointly measure the velocity amplitude A_v and Gamma to around 25%

When the surveys are combined however, the major degeneracy between beta and
r_g is lifted and we are able to measure A_g, Gamma, beta and r_g all to the 2%
level, significantly improving on current estimates. Finally we consider scale
dependence of r_g and the biassing parameter b. We find that measurements for

the photometric indices alone defines a sample of 34 stars at the cluster
turnoff that imply E(b-y)=0.042(0.002) or E(B-V) = 0.058(0.003), where the
errors (s.e.m) refer to internal errors alone. With this reddening, [Fe/H] is
derived from both m1 and hk using both b-y and Hbeta as the temperature

value of [Fe/H] = -0.14 (0.03) for the cluster and removing the apparent
discrepancy between the past uvby analyses and extensive results from the red

the original m1 indices. Using the homogenized and combined V, b-y data from a
variety of studies transformed to B-V, the cluster CMD is compared to NGC 752,
IC 4651, and the core-convective-overshoot isochrones of Girardi et al. (2002).
By interpolation to the proper metallicity, it is found that the E(B-V), (m-M),
and age for NGC 752, IC 4651, and NGC 3680 are (0.03, 8.30, 1.55 Gyr), (0.10,
10.20, 1.7 Gyr), and (0.06, 10.20, 1.85 Gyr), respectively. The revised age and
metallicity sequence and the color distribution of the giants provide evidence
for the suggestion that the giants defining the apparent clump in NGC 3680 are
predominantly first-ascent giants, as indicated by their Li abundance, while
the clump stars in NGC 752, 0.1 mag bluer in (B-V), are He-core-burning stars.
When combined with the color distribution in IC 4651, it is suggested that over
this modest age range where He-core flash becomes important, the distribution
of so-called clump stars switches from being dominated by He-core burning stars
to first-ascent giants in the bump phase.

photometry revealed those objects within the scan region that fluctuate in
brightness at a statistically significant level. Subsequent spectroscopic
observations of a subset of those varying objects easily discriminated the
quasars from stars. For a 13-month time scale, 38% of the previously known
quasars within the scan region were seen to vary in brightness and subsequent
spectroscopic observation revealed that approximately 7% of all variable

additional and ongoing synoptic searches for new quasars and their subsequent

density throughout the neutron star crust, whereas in reality the density and
all transport coefficients vary by many orders of magnitude. Here, we extend
the investigation of the Hall--drift induced instability by considering
realistic profiles of density and chemical composition, as well as background
fields with more justified radial profiles. Two neutron star models are
considered differing primarily in the assumption on the core matter equation of
state. For their cooling history and radial profiles of density and composition
we use known results to infer the conductivity profiles. These were fed into
linear calculations of a dipolar field decay starting from various initial
configurations. At different stages of the decay, snapshots of the magnetic
fields at the equator were taken to yield background field profiles for the
stability analysis. The main result is that the Hall instability may really
occur in neutron star crusts. Characteristic growth times are in the order of

strength. The influence of the equation of state and of the initial field

occurs in highly intermittent, non-asymmetric fashion favorable to
gravitational wave emission in a neutrino cooled disk. This picture of
near-hole accretion is motivated by magneto-rotationally induced,
ultra-relativistic disk dynamics in the region of the flow bounded from below
by the marginally bound geodesic radius. For high spin values, a largely
coherent magnetic field in this region has the dynamical implication of compact
mass segregation at the displacement nodes of the non-axisymmetric, MRI modes.
When neutrino stress competes favorably for the disk dynamical structure, the
matter clumps may be rather dense and sufficiently long-lived to excite the
Quasi-Normal Ringing (a.k.a. QNR) modes of the Kerr geometry upon their
in-fall. We find that such accretion flow may drive bar-like, quadrupole
(l,m=2,2) modes in nearly resonant fashion for spin parameters $a \geq .9$. The
ensuing build up in strain amplitude of the undamped oscillations warrants a
brisk rate of energy deposition into gravitational waves. A detectability
assessment for the LIGO interferometers through the match filtering technique
is given by integrating the energy flux over a one second epoch of resonant
hyper-accretion at $1 \msun \sec^{-1}$. Thus, a $15 \msun$ Kerr black hole
spinning at $a \simeq .98$ ($f_{\rm QNR} \simeq 1677$ Hz), and located at 27
Mpc (e.g., GRB980425), will deliver a characteristic strain amplitude, $h_{\rm
char} \simeq 2.2_{-21}$, large enough to be detectable by LIGO II. If resonant
hyper-accretion were sustainable for a longer period (or at higher rates)
possibly associated with a second broad hump in a GRB light-curve, these
objects could be detected by LIGO I at very low redshifts.

ionisation due to X-rays produced by black hole accretion in small-mass

stellar sources at z~7. This scenario is motivated by the large optical depth
to Thompson scattering, tau_e=0.17, measured by WMAP. But it is also consistent
with the observed Gunn-Peterson trough in the spectra of quasars at z~5-6. We
use a semianalytic code to explore models with different black hole accretion
histories and cosmological parameters.We find that ``preionisation'' by X-rays
can increase the intergalactic medium (IGM) optical depth from tau_e~0.06 given
by stellar sources only, to 0.1<tau_e<0.2, if a fraction of baryons 5x10^-5 is
accreted onto seed black holes produced in the collapse of low metallicity,
high mass stars before z~15. To be effective, preionisation requires a
non-negligible star formation in the first small-mass galaxies in hich seed
black holes are formed.The model predicts that dwarf spheroidal galaxies may
host a mass in black holes that is 5-40% of their stellar mass. The redshifted
X-ray background produced by this early epoch of black hole accretion
constitutes about 5-10% of the X-ray background in the 2-50 keV bands and
roughtly half of the currently estimated black hole mass density was formed at
early times.Moreover, in most models, the photons from the redshifted
background are sufficient to fully reionise HeII at redshift z~3 without any
additional contribution from quasars at lower redshifts and the temperature of
the mean density intergalactic medium remains close to 10^4 K down to redshift

of HI Ly-alpha emission from the low-redshift (z<0.5) intergalactic medium

optically thin regions of the IGM but not that of self-shielded gas. We
therefore consider several models that bracket the expected emission from
self-shielded regions. Most galaxies are surrounded by extended (>10^2 kpc)
``coronae'' of optically thin gas with Ly-alpha surface brightness close to the
expected background. Most of these regions contain smaller cores of dense, cool
gas. Unless self-shielded gas is able to cool to T<10^4.1 K, these cores are
much brighter than the background. The Ly-alpha coronae represent ``cooling

Ly-alpha photons produced through the reprocessing of stellar ionizing

star; two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations by Marietta et. al. show that,
in the interaction, the companion star carves out a conical hole of opening
angle 30-40 degrees in the supernova ejecta. In this paper we use
multi-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations to explore the
observable consequences of an ejecta-hole asymmetry. We calculate the variation
of the spectrum, luminosity, and polarization with viewing angle for the
aspherical supernova near maximum light. We find that the supernova looks
normal from almost all viewing angles except when one looks almost directly
down the hole. In the latter case, one sees into the deeper, hotter layers of
ejecta. The supernova is relatively brighter and has a peculiar spectrum
characterized by more highly ionized species, weaker absorption features, and
lower absorption velocities. The spectrum viewed down the hole is comparable to
the class of SN 1991T-like supernovae. We consider how the ejecta-hole
asymmetry may explain the current spectropolarimetric observations of SNe Ia,
and suggest a few observational signatures of the geometry. Finally, we discuss
the variety currently seen in observed SNe Ia and how an ejecta-hole asymmetry
may fit in as one of several possible sources of diversity.

M-giant stars present in the 2MASS All Sky catalogue. Several large-scale
asymmetries are detected, the most significant of which is a strong
elliptical-shaped stellar over-density, close to the Galactic plane at (l=240,
b=-8), in the constellation of Canis Major. A small grouping of globular
clusters (NGC 1851, NGC 1904, NGC 2298, and NGC 2808), coincident in position
and radial velocity, surround this structure, as do a number of open clusters.
The population of M-giant stars in this over-density is similar in number to
that in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. We argue that this object is
the likely dwarf galaxy progenitor of the ring-like structure that has recently
been found at the edge of the Galactic disk. A numerical study of the tidal
disruption of an accreted dwarf galaxy is presented. The simulated debris fits
well the extant position, distance and velocity information on the ``Galactic
Ring'', as well as that of the M-giant over-densities, suggesting that all
these structures are the consequence of a single accretion event. The disrupted
dwarf galaxy stream orbits close to the Galactic Plane, with a pericentre at
approximately the Solar circle, an orbital eccentricity similar to that of
stars in the Galactic thick disk, as well as a vertical scale height similar to
that of the thick disk. This finding strongly suggests that the Canis Major
dwarf galaxy is a building block of the Galactic thick disk, that the thick
disk is continually growing, even up to the present time, and that thick disk
globular clusters were accreted onto the Milky Way from dwarf galaxies in
co-planar orbits.

extraction from reservoirs in capillary rise geometries, represent an extreme
limit which is of physical and technological relevance since the dynamics is
governed solely by capillary forces. In this work we use kinetic Monte Carlo
(KMC) simulations to analyze in detail a simple, but realistic model proposed
by Burlatsky \textit{et al.} \cite{Burlatsky_prl96,Oshanin_jml} for the
two-dimensional spreading on homogeneous substrates of a fluid monolayer which
is extracted from a reservoir. Our simulations confirm the previously predicted
time-dependence of the spreading, $X(t \to \infty) = A \sqrt t$, with $X(t)$ as
the average position of the advancing edge at time $t$, and they reveal a
non-trivial dependence of the prefactor $A$ on the strength $U_0$ of
inter-particle attraction and on the fluid density $C_0$ at the reservoir as
well as an $U_0$-dependent spatial structure of the density profile of the
monolayer. The asymptotic density profile at long time and large spatial scale
is carefully analyzed within the continuum limit. We show that including the
effect of correlations in an effective manner into the standard mean-field
description leads to predictions both for the value of the threshold
interaction above which phase segregation occurs and for the density profiles

study how the phase separation kinetics of a symmetric binary immiscible fluid

increase in amphiphile concentration slows down domain growth, initially from
algebraic, to logarithmic temporal dependence, and, at higher concentrations,
from logarithmic to stretched-exponential form. In growth-arrested
stretched-exponential regimes, at late times we observe the self-assembly of
sponge mesophases and gyroid liquid crystalline cubic mesophases, hence
confirming that (a) amphiphile-amphiphile interactions need not be long-ranged
in order for periodically modulated structures to arise in a dynamics of
competing interactions, and (b) a chemically-specific model of the amphiphile
is not required for the self-assembly of cubic mesophases, contradicting claims
in the literature. We also observe a structural order-disorder transition
between sponge and gyroid phases driven by amphiphile concentration alone or,
independently, by the amphiphile-amphiphile and the amphiphile-binary fluid
coupling parameters. For the growth-arrested mesophases, we also observe
temporal oscillations in the structure function at all length scales; most of
the wavenumbers show slow decay, and long-term stationarity or growth for the
others. We ascribe this behaviour to a combination of complex amphiphile

symmetry is our example. This system is realized in triatomic molecules like
Na_3. Unlike the fixed dipole of a molecule like water, the quantum moment does
not point in a fixed direction, but lies in the plane of the molecule and takes
quantized values +/- mu_0 along any direction of measurement in the plane. An

  The new version takes layered top trees into account",,,,"cs.DS",,"  We introduce top trees as a design of a new simpler interface for data
structures maintaining information in a fully-dynamic forest. We demonstrate
how easy and versatile they are to use on a host of different applications. For
example, we show how to maintain the diameter, center, and median of each tree
in the forest. The forest can be updated by insertion and deletion of edges and
by changes to vertex and edge weights. Each update is supported in O(log n)
time, where n is the size of the tree(s) involved in the update. Also, we show
how to support nearest common ancestor queries and level ancestor queries with
respect to arbitrary roots in O(log n) time. Finally, with marked and unmarked
vertices, we show how to compute distances to a nearest marked vertex. The
later has applications to approximate nearest marked vertex in general graphs,
and thereby to static optimization problems over shortest path metrics.
  Technically speaking, top trees are easily implemented either with
Frederickson's topology trees [Ambivalent Data Structures for Dynamic
2-Edge-Connectivity and k Smallest Spanning Trees, SIAM J. Comput. 26 (2) pp.

claim that the interface is simpler for many applications, and indeed our new
bounds are quadratic improvements over previous bounds where they exist.

concentrated at the wormhole throat, are determined. This construction allows
one to apply a dynamical analysis to the throat, considering linearized radial
perturbations around static solutions. For a large positive cosmological
constant, i.e., for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution, the region of
stability is significantly increased, relatively to the null cosmological
constant case, analyzed by Poisson and Visser. With a negative cosmological
constant, i.e., the Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter solution, the region of
stability is decreased. In particular, considering static solutions with a
generic cosmological constant, the weak and dominant energy conditions are
violated, while for $a_0 \leq 3M$ the null and strong energy conditions are
satisfied. The surface pressure of the static solution is strictly positive for
the Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter spacetimes, but takes
negative values, assuming a surface tension in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter
solution, for high values of the cosmological constant and the wormhole throat
radius.

theories on a class of compact spatial manifolds (including S^{d-1} \times
time) undergo deconfinement phase transitions at temperatures proportional to
the inverse length scale of the manifold in question. The low temperature phase
has a free energy of order one, and is characterized by a stringy (Hagedorn)
growth in its density of states. The high temperature phase has a free energy
of order N^2. These phases are separated either by a single first order
transition that generically occurs below the Hagedorn temperature or by two
continuous phase transitions, the first of which occurs at the Hagedorn
temperature. These phase transitions could perhaps be continuously connected to
the usual flat space deconfinement transition in the case of confining gauge
theories, and to the Hawking-Page nucleation of AdS_5 black holes in the case
of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We suggest that deconfinement
transitions may generally be interpreted in terms of black hole formation in a
dual string theory. Our analysis proceeds by first reducing the Yang-Mills
partition function to a (0+0)-dimensional integral over a unitary matrix U,
which is the holonomy (Wilson loop) of the gauge field around the thermal time
circle in Euclidean space; deconfinement transitions are large N transitions in
this matrix integral.

the asymmetric q-P_{V} and asymmetric d-P_{IV}. This approach allows us to
describe in a unified way the evolution of the mapping along the independent
variable and along the various parameters (the latter evolution being the one
induced by the Schlesinger transformations). It turns out that both discrete
Painlev\'e equations exhibit the property of self-duality: the same equation
governs the evolution along any direction in the space of E_{6}^{(1)}.

capability to calculate calorimetric and isotopic observables with precision.
With this new model we examine the influence of nuclear isospin on the fragment
elemental and isotopic distributions. We show that the proposed improvements on
the model are essential for studying isospin effects in nuclear
multifragmentation. In particular, these calculations show that accurate
comparisons to experimental data require that the nuclear masses, free energies
and secondary decay must be handled with higher precision than many current
models accord.

the quantum states of photons. It is shown that there exist analogies between
the photonic quantum states and the conformal group, namely, the
time-development operator (with a free Hamiltonian), displacement and squeezing
operators of the vacuum state corresponds to the dilatation, translation,
proper Lorentz transformations, respectively, and that the three quantum states
of photons ({\it i.e.}, Fock state, coherent state and squeezed state) in
quantum optics thus bear some analogy to the above three transformations in the
conformal group. Based on this comparison, we argue by analogy that if the
phase transformation operators acting on a vacuum state (hence the Fock state,
coherent state and squeezed state are generated) are truly exactly analogous to
the conformal transformations, then a fourth quantum state of photons (referred
to as the {\it conformal state}), which corresponds to the {\it special
conformal} transformation (acceleration transformation) and will therefore be
of special physical interest, can be suggested.

beam expanded in a fan shape by a small rotary cylindrical lens. The light
diffused from the cornea is observed by two cameras and processed in order to
yield the surfaces' profiles. The optical system used to project a thin
rotating line on the cornea consists of a white light source provided with
optical fiber bundle output which is first conditioned by a set of lenses so
that it would produce a spot on the cornea. A small cylinder lens is used to
expand the beam in one direction so that a thin line illuminates the cornea,
rather than a spot. The cylinder lens is provided with motor driven rotation
about an axis normal to its own in order to rotate the line on the cornea such
that the projected line scans the whole cornea; the illuminator is completed
with a slit aperture. The cornea is not perfectly transparent, scattering some
of the light that traverses it; this fact is used for its observation by two
cameras. These are placed at pre-defined angles with the illumination axis, so
that optical sections of the cornea can be seen; the use of two cameras avoids
the need for camera rotation in synchronism with the cylinder. The two cameras'
images can be combined in order to simulate a single virtual rotating camera.
Image processing is used to extract information about the corneal surfaces
profiles and thickness from the optical sections. Several peculiar aspects of
processing are discussed, namely the corneal edge detection algorithm, the
correction for angle of view and deformation due to observation of the inner
surface through the cornea.

neutrinos emitted from a 20 $M_{\odot}$ pre-supernova star at the silicon
burning phase is estimated. The spectrum of the neutrinos with an average
energy $\sim$2 MeV is calculated with the use of the Monte Carlo method. A few
relevant reactions for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos in modern detectors are
considered. The most promising results are from $\bar{\nu}_e + p
\longrightarrow n + e^{+}$ reaction. During the Si-burning phase we expect 1.27
neutrons/day/kiloton of water to be produced by neutrinos from a star located
at a distance of 1 kpc. Small admixture of effective neutron-absorbers as e.g.
NaCl or GdCl$_{3}$ makes these neutrons easily visible because of Cherenkov
light produced by electrons which were hit by $\sim$8 MeV photon cascade
emitted by Cl or Gd nuclei. The estimated rate of neutron production for SNO
and Super-Kamiokande is, respectively, 2.2 and 41 events per day for a star at
1 kpc. For future detectors UNO and Hyper-Kamiokande we expect 5.6 and 6.9
events per day even for a star 10 kpc away. This would make it possible to
foresee a massive star death a few days before its core collapse. Importance of
such a detection for theoretical astrophysics is discussed.

incorporated into the moderate cooling flow model lead to a general cooling
flow model with the following ingredients. (1) Cooling flow does occur, but
with a mass cooling rate about 10 times lower than in old versions of the
cooling flow model. Namely, heating occurs such that the effective age of the
cooling flow is much below the cluster age, but the heating can't prevent
cooling altogether. (2) The cooling flow region is in a non-steady state

hole mass is considered in this work. A significant anti-correlation is found
between these two quantities in the sense that the excess variance decreases
with increasing black hole mass. This anti-correlation is consistent with the
hypothesis that the 2-10 keV power spectrum in AGN follows a power law of slope
-2 at high frequencies. It then flattens to a slope of -1 below a break
frequency until a second break frequency below which it flattens to a slope of
zero. The ratio of the two break frequencies is equal to 10-30, similar to the
ratio of the respective frequencies in Cyg X-1. The power spectrum amplitude in
the ""frequency x power"" space does not depend on black hole mass. Instead it is
roughly equal to 0.02 in all objects. The high frequency break decreases with
increasing black hole mass according to the relation 1.5x(10^-6)/(BHmass/(10^7)
solar masses) Hz, in the case of ""classical"" Seyfert 1 galaxies. The excess
variance of NGC4051, a Narrow Line Seyfert 1 object, is larger than what is
expected for its black hole mass and X-ray luminosity. This can be explained if
its high frequency break is 20 times larger than the value expected in the case
of a ""classical"" Seyfert 1 with the same black hole mass. Finally, the excess
variance vs X-ray luminosity correlation is a byproduct of the excess variance
vs black hole mass correlation, with AGN accreting at ~ 0.1-0.15 the Eddington
limit. These results are consistent with recent results from the power spectral
analysis of AGN.

the low energy neutrinos emitted in triton decay with maximum neutrino energy
of 18.6 keV. The technical challenges to this end can be achieved by building a
very large TPC capable of detecting low energy recoils, down to a a few tenths
of a keV, within the required low background constraints. More specifically We
propose the development of a spherical gaseous TPC of about 10-m in radius and
a 200 Mcurie triton source in the center of curvature. One can list a number of
exciting studies, concerning fundamental physics issues, that could be made
using a large volume TPC and low energy antineutrinos: 1) The oscillation
length involving the small angle of the neutrino mixing matrix, directly
measured in this disappearance experiment, is fully contained inside the
detector. Measuring the counting rate of neutrino-electron elastic scattering
as a function of the distance of the source will give a precise and unambiguous
measurement of the oscillation parameters free of systematic errors. In fact
first estimates show that even with a year's data taking a sensitivity of a few
percent for the measurement of the above angle will be achieved. 2) The low
energy detection threshold offers a unique sensitivity for the neutrino
magnetic moment which is about two orders of magnitude beyond the current
experimental limit. 3) Scattering at such low neutrino energies has never been
studied and any departure from the expected behavior may be an indication of
new physics beyond the standard model. In this work we mainly focus on the
various theoretical issues involved including a precise determination of the
Weinberg angle at very low momentum transfer.

  Pairwise Distances?","10 pages",,,,"math.MG cs.CV math.AC math.AG",,"  In a previous paper we showed that, for any $n \ge m+2$, most sets of $n$
points in $\RR^m$ are determined (up to rotations, reflections, translations
and relabeling of the points) by the distribution of their pairwise distances.
But there are some exceptional point configurations which are not
reconstructible from the distribution of distances in the above sense. In this
paper, we present a reconstructibility test with running time $O(n^{11})$. The
cases of orientation preserving rigid motions (rotations and translations) and
scalings are also discussed.

$\Bbb C[W]\ltimes A^{\otimes n}$ where $A$ is the $q$-Weyl algebra or any its
degeneration and $W$ is the Weyl group of type $A_{n-1}$ or $B_n$. For a
deformation quantization $A_+$ of an affine symplectic variety $X$ we show that
the Hochschild homology of $S^n A$, $A=A_+[\hbar^{-1}]$ is additively
isomorphic to the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology of $S^nX$ with coefficients in
$\Bbb C((\hbar))$. We prove that for $X$ satisfying $H^1(X,\Bbb C)=0$ (or $A\in
VB(d)$) the deformation of $S^nX$ ($\Bbb C[S_n]\ltimes A^{\otimes n}$) which
does not come from deformations of $X$ ($A$) exists if and only if $\dim X=2$
($d=2$). In particular if $A$ is $q$-Weyl algebra (its trigonometric or
rational degeneration) then the corresponding nontrivial deformations yield the
double affine Hecke algebras of type $A_{n-1}$ (its trigonometric or rational
versions) introduced by Cherednik.

potential is used to describe a vacancy defect in a crystal. According to
recent numerical results [Cuevas et al, Phys. Lett. A 315, 364 (2003)] the
vacancy can migrate when it interacts with a moving breather. We study more
thoroughly the phenomenology caused by the interaction of moving breathers with
a single vacancy and also with double vacancies. We show that vacancy mobility
is strongly correlated with the existence and stability properties of
stationary breathers centered at the particles adjacent to the vacancy, which
we will now call vacancy breathers.

$\delta$-pairing model are comparable with experimental data. The
state-dependence of pairing has an important effect on the calculated fission
half-lives.

the assumption of squeezed-like state, a new vacuum state is obtained for the
interacting system. The energy of the new vacuum state is lower than that given
by the second-order perturbation theory in existing theories. In our theory,
the Casimir effect is attributed neither to the quantum fluctuation in the
zero-point energy of the genuine electromagnetic field nor to that in the
zero-point energy of the genuine matter field, but to that in the vacuum state
of the interacting system. Both electromagnetic field and matter field are
responsible for the Casimir effect.

observations of rotation curves of galaxies. We ``observe'' and analyze our
models in much the same way as observers do the real galaxies. We find that the
tilted ring model analysis produces an underestimate of the central rotational
velocity. In some cases the galaxy halo density profile seems to have a flat
core, while in reality it does not. We identify three effects, which explain
the systematic biases: (1) inclination (2), small bulge, and (3) bar. The
presence of even a small non-rotating bulge component reduces the rotation
velocity. In the case of a disk with a bar, the underestimate of the circular
velocity is larger due to a combination of non-circular motions and random
velocities. Signatures of bars can be difficult to detect in the surface
brightness profiles of the model galaxies. The variation of inclination angle
and isophote position angle with radius are more reliable indicators of bar
presence than the surface brightness profiles. The systematic biases in the
central ~ 1 kpc of galaxies are not large. Each effect separately gives
typically a few kms error, but the effects add up. In some cases the error in
circular velocity was a factor of two, but typically we get about 20 percent.
The result is the false inference that the density profile of the halo flattens
in the central parts. Our observations of real galaxies show that for a large
fraction of galaxies the velocity of gas rotation (as measured by emission
lines) is very close to the rotation of stellar component (as measured by
absorption lines). This implies that the systematic effects discussed in this
paper are also applicable both for the stars and emission-line gas.

combined with existing photometry at other wavelengths to assemble the spectral

In addition, we used ISOPHOT spectra to compute average MIR spectra for
different types of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The MIR emission of 53 of our
sources shows evidence of dust. We find a clear correlation between the SEDs,
emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and the type of AGN.
Specifically, we find that in broad emission line radio galaxies (BLRGs), the
dust emission peaks at ~40 microns and PAH bands are weak, whereas emission in
comparable narrow line radio galaxies (NLRGs) peaks at a longer wavelength of
\~100microns and the PAH bands are much stronger. Although less pronounced, a
similar trend is seen when comparing quasars (QSOs) with high-luminosity NLRGs.
We used dust radiative transfer models with a central heating source to
describe the SEDs. The difference in the dust emission appears to be the effect
of heating by radiation from the central engine. In type~1 AGNs (BLRGs and
QSOs), the broad line region (BLR) is directly visible and therefore hot
(T>~300K) dust dominates the emission. In this region, PAHs are destroyed which
explains the weak PAH emission. On the other hand, the BLR is hidden in type~2
AGNs (NLRGs). Their SEDs are therefore dominated by cooler dust including PAHs.

low-velocity system is part of the broad absorption line (BAL), while the
high-velocity one is well detached. While most narrow absorption components are
only detected in the high-ionization species, the lowest velocity component is
detected in both high- and low-ionization species, including in the excited
SiII* and CII* lines. From the analysis of doublet lines, we find that the
narrow absorption lines at the low-velocity end of the BAL trough are
completely saturated but do not reach zero flux, their profiles being dominated
by a velocity-dependent covering factor. The covering factor is significantly
smaller for MgII than for SiIV and NV, which demonstrates the intrinsic nature
of absorber. From the analysis of the excited SiII* and CII* lines in the
lowest velocity component, we find an electron density ~ 1000 cm^{-3}. Assuming
photoionization equilibrium, we derive a distance ~ 20 kpc between the

closely associated, hence formed at the same distance of ~ 20 kpc, much higher

It is usually argued that gravitational confinement causes the high pressures,
and that the clouds are (magneto)hydrostaticobjects supported by a balance
between magnetic and turbulent pressures and gravity. However, magnetic
pressures appear too weak, and MHD turbulent support not only requires driving,
but also results in continuing gravitational collapse, as has now been
demonstrated in simulations reaching 512^3 zones. Models of supernova-driven,
magnetized turbulence readily form transient, high-pressure, dense regions that
may form molecular clouds. They are contained not by self-gravity, but by
turbulent ram pressures from the larger flow. Apparent virialization may
actually be a geometrical effect. Turbulent clouds are unlikely to be in
hydrostatic equilibrium, instead either collapsing or expanding, although they
may appear well-fit by projected equilibrium Bonnor-Ebert spheres. Collapsing
clouds probably form stars efficiently, while expanding ones can still form
stars by turbulent compression, but rather inefficiently.

percent of accretion luminosity) on timescales much longer than expected for
the disc regions releasing most of the luminosity. We propose an explicit
physical model for disc variability, consistent with Lyubarskii's (1997)
general scheme for solving this problem. We suggest that local dynamo processes
can affect the evolution of an accretion disc by driving angular momentum loss
in the form of an outflow (a wind or jet). We model the dynamo as a small-scale
stochastic phenomenon, operating on roughly the local dynamical timescale. We
argue that large-scale outflow can only occur when the small-scale random
processes in neighbouring disc annuli give rise by chance to a coherent
large-scale magnetic field. This occurs on much longer timescales, and causes a
bright large-amplitude flare as a wide range of disc radii evolve in a coherent
fashion. Most of the time, dynamo action instead produces small-amplitude
flickering. We reproduce power spectra similar to those observed, including a
1/f power spectrum below a break frequency given by the magnetic alignment
timescale at the inner disc edge. However the relation between the black hole
mass and the value of the break frequency is less straightforward than often
assumed in the literature. The effect of an outer disc edge is to flatten the
spectrum below the magnetic alignment frequency there. We also find a
correlation between the variability amplitude and luminosity, similar to that
found in some AGN.

The problem of reduced description is studied as a problem of constructing the
slow invariant manifold. The invariance conditions are formulated as the
differential equation for a manifold immersed in the phase space (the
invariance equation). The equation of motion for immersed manifolds is obtained
(the film extension of the dynamics). Invariant manifolds are fixed points for
this equation, and slow invariant manifolds are Lyapunov stable fixed points,
thus slowness is presented as stability. A collection of methods for
construction of slow invariant manifolds is presented, in particular the
analogue of KAM methods for dissipative systems. We systematically consider a
discrete analogue of the slow (stable) positively invariant manifolds for
dissipative systems, invariant grids. The following examples of applications
are presented: Nonperturbative deviation of physically consistent hydrodynamics
from the Boltzmann equation and from the reversible dynamics, for Knudsen
numbers ~ 1; construction of the moment equations for nonequilibrium media and
their dynamical correction (instead of extension of list of variables) to gain
more accuracy in description of highly nonequilibrium flows; invariant grids

charge density fluctuations with wave vectors bearing special relations with
those of the spin density fluctuations. In the low temperature regime, not only
the wave vectors, but also the mutual phases of the CDW and SDW become coupled
due to a quantum interference phenomenon, leading to the stripe phase
instability in a quasi one-dimensional repulsive electron system. It is shown
that away from half filling periodic lattice potential causes cooperative

are terminated at the finite level $m$ in the level-$m$ AMM (AMM$m$), which
yields $(3+m)$-dimensional deterministic DEs. Model calculations have been made

the linear Langevin model with N=1 is nicely compared to the exact result. The
synchronization induced by an applied single spike is shown to be enhanced in
the nonlinear Langevin ensemble with model parameters locating at the

magneto-optically traced in three experiments: (i) during continuous injection
of transient vortex states while ramping up the external magnetic field, (ii)
during annealing of injected transient states while keeping the external field
constant, and (iii) during annealing of transient 'supercooled' disordered
states while ramping down the external field. The results reveal front-like
propagation (experiment i) or retreat (experiments ii and iii) of the transient
vortex states, at a rate governed by the rate of change of the external field,
the annealing time tau of the transient states and the creep rate. The
experimental results are theoretically analyzed in terms of competition between
generation and annealing of transient disordered vortex states. Extraction of
the annealing time tau from the above three experiments, yields the same
results for tau as a function of the induction, B, and temperature T. Knowledge
of tau(B,T) allows for correct determination of the thermodynamic
order-disorder vortex phase transition line.

correction to the classical energy turns out to be proportional to the square
of the string tension or the 't Hooft coupling \lambda, suggesting that it can

  'Lorentz-boost' transformation matrix","25 pages, revised",,,,"hep-th",,"  The main purpose of this paper is to rethink the relativity issue within the
framework of the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics. The aspect of
so-called ``double special relativity'' (DSR) is a starting point in our
discussion. The three elementary ideas were involved to show that special
relativity may be treated as an integral part of quantum mechanics. These ideas
(or observations) are: (1) the necessity of distinguishing the two time
meanings, namely: (i) the vital one referring to description of system
evolution, and (ii) the frozen one, referring to energy measure by means of
inverse time units; (2) the existence of the energy-momentum (and
time-distance) comparison scale in relativistic description; and (3) a
possibility of introduction of mass by means of a light-cone frame description.
The resulting quantum-mechanical analysis allows us to find diagonal form of
the Lorentz-boost transformation matrix and thus to relate the interval
invariant relativity principle with the principles of quantum mechanics. The
manner, in which the diagonal form of the transformation matrix was found,
shows that covariant description itself is a preferred frame description and
that the time that undergoes relativistic transformation rules is the frozen
time, whereas the vital time is the Lorentz invariant. A generalized form of
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle proposed by Witten (Phys. Today, Apriel
1996), is derived. It turns out, that this form is equivalent to the one know
from the analysis of the covariant harmonic oscillator given by Kim and Noz
(the book, 1986). As a by-product of this analysis one finds that special
relativity itself preserves the Planck length, however, a particle cannot be
seen any longer as a material point, but rather as an extended quantum object.

convergence rate of our general algorithm and the more special Riemannian
averaging algorithm. The algorithm is also used to provide a constructive proof
of Karcher's theorem on the existence and local uniqueness of the center of

some desired activity. This can give rise to HI, a manifestation of which is in

of the Galactic Plane in a limited energy range around $10^{18}$ eV (EeV). This
is very suggestive of neutrons as candidate primaries, because the directional
signal requires relatively-stable neutral primaries, and time-dilated neutrons
can reach Earth from typical Galactic distances when the neutron energy exceeds
an EeV. We here point out that if the Galactic messengers are neutrons, then
those with energies below an EeV will decay in flight, providing a flux of
cosmic antineutrinos above a TeV which is {\it observable} at a kilometer-scale
neutrino observatory. The expected event rate per year above 1 TeV in a
detector such as IceCube, for example, is 20 antineutrino showers (all flavors)
and a $1^\circ$ directional signal of 4 $\bar \nu_\mu$ events. A measurement of
this flux can serve to identify the first extraterrestrial point source of TeV
antineutrinos.

discovery of luminous quasars at z~6, and estimates of the local mass density
of SMBHs. If ~90 per cent of this mass was accreted at redshifts z<3, as
suggested by the observed quasar luminosity functions, these joint constraints
pose a challenge for models, which must account for the observed luminous
quasar population at z~6 within a very limited `mass budget'. We investigate a
class of models based within the hierarchical structure formation scenario, in
which major mergers lead to black hole formation and fuelling, and the
resulting quasars shine at their Eddington-limited rate until their fuel is
exhausted. We show that the simplest such model, in which a constant fraction
of the gas within the halo is accreted in each major merger, cannot satisfy
both constraints simultaneously. When this model is normalized to reproduce the
number density of luminous quasars at z~6, the mass budget is grossly exceeded
due to an overabundance of lower mass SMBHs. We explore a range of
modifications to the simple model designed to overcome this problem. We show
that both constraints can be satisfied if the gas accretion fraction scales as
a function of the halo virial velocity. Similar scalings have been proposed in
order to reproduce the local M-sigma relation. Successful models can also be
constructed by restricting the formation of seed black holes to redshifts above
z~11.5 or to haloes above a velocity threshold ~55 km/s, or assuming that only
a fraction of major mergers result in formation of a seed SMBH. (abridged)

excited states made with ground-based telescopes in order to constrain the
formation rate of H2 on grain surfaces under the physical conditions in the
layers responsible for H2 emission. We use steady state PDR models in order to
examine the sensitivity of different H2 line ratios to the H2 formation rate
Rf. We show that the ratio of the 0-0 S(3) to the 1-0 S(1) line increases with
Rf but that one requires independent estimates of the radiation field incident
upon the PDR and the density in order to infer Rf from the H2 line data. We
confirm the earlier result of Habart et al. (2003) that the H2 formation rate
in regions of moderate excitation such as Oph W, S140 and IC 63 is a factor of
5 times larger than the standard rate inferred from UV observations of diffuse
clouds. On the other hand, towards regions of higher radiation field such as
the Orion Bar and NGC 2023, we derive H2 formation rates consistent with the
standard value. We find also a correlation between the H2 1-0 S(1) line and PAH
emission suggesting that Rf scales with the PAH abundance. With the aim of
explaining these results, we consider some empirical models of the H2 formation
process. Here we consider both formation on big (a~0.1 microns) and small (a~10
Angstroms) grains by either direct recombination from the gas phase or
recombination of physisorbed H atoms with atoms in a chemisorbed site. We
conclude that indirect chemisorption is most promising in PDRs. Moreover small
grains which dominate the total grain surface and spend most of their time at
relatively low temperatures may be the most promising surface for forming H2 in
PDRs.

associated with the ionised cloud rims, that associated with embedded possible
massive YSOs and that unlikely to be associated with the clouds at all. A total
of 18 clouds display radio emission clearly associated with the cloud rim and
we determine the ionising photon flux illuminating these clouds and the
electron density and pressure of their ionised boundary layers. Using a global
estimate for the interior molecular pressure of these clouds we show that the
majority are likely to be in pressure equilibrium and hence are currently being
shocked by photoionisation-induced shocks. We identify those clouds where the
predicted ionising photon flux is inconsistent with that derived from the

the BRCs are earlier than previously thought or that there must be additional
ionising sources within the HII regions. Finally, we identify the radio sources
embedded within the clouds with infrared stellar clusters and show that they
contain late O and early B-type stars, demonstrating that a number of BRCs are
intimately involved with high to intermediate-mass star formation.

analytic gravitational infall models or numerical N-body methods. Unlike the
collisionless Boltzmann equation, our kinetic equation contains nonzero terms
on the right-hand side arising from stochastic fluctuations in the
gravitational potential due to substructures in the dark matter mass
distribution. Using statistics for constrained Gaussian random fields in
standard cosmological models, we show that our kinetic equation to second-order
in perturbation theory is of the Fokker-Planck form, with one scattering term
representing drift and the other representing diffusion in velocity-space. The
drift is radial, and the drift and diffusion coefficients depend only on
positions and not velocities; our relaxation process in the quasilinear regime
is therefore different from the standard two-body relaxation. We provide
explicit expressions relating these coefficients to the linear power spectrum
of mass fluctuation and present results for the currently favored cold dark
matter model with a nonzero cosmological constant. Solutions to this kinetic
equation will provide a complete description of the cold dark matter spatial
and velocity distributions for the average halo during the early phases of
galaxy halo formation.

transformation for gravity and light. Because, according to Einstein, the

presupernova star is to be sufficiently massive to collapse into a black hole,
earlier in the evolution of the star the He core must be covered (clothed) by a
hydrogen envelope during He core burning and removed only following this, in,
e.g. common envelope evolution. This is classified as Case C mass transfer.
These previous arguments were based chiefly on stellar evolution, especially
depending on the way in which 12C burned.
  In this work we argue for Case C mass transfer on the basis of binary
evolution. The giant progenitor of the black hole will have a large radius 1000
Rsun at the end of its supergiant stage. Its lifetime at that point will be
short, about 1000 yrs, so it will not expand much further. Thus, the initial
giant radius for Case C mass transfer will be constrained to a narrow band
about 1000 Rsun. This has the consequence that the final separation a_f
following common envelope evolution will depend nearly linearly on the mass of
the companion m_d which becomes the donor after the He core of the giant has
collapsed into the black hole. The separation at which this collapse takes
place is essentially a_f, because of the rapid evolution of the giant. (In at
least two binaries the black hole donor separation has been substantially
increased because of mass loss in the black hole formation. These can be
reconstructed from the amount of mass deposited on the donor in this mass
loss.)
  We show that the reconstructed preexplosion separations of the black hole
binaries fit well the linear relationship.

source 3C264, sensitive to linear scales ranging from the parsec to several
kiloparsecs. The observations confirm the existence of regions with different
properties in the first kiloparsec of the jet. The most remarkable feature is
the transition between a well collimated narrow jet at distances from the core
below 80 pc, to a conical-shaped wide jet, with an opening angle of 20 degrees.
Another change of properties, consisting of an apparent deflection of the jet
ridge line and a diminution of the surface brightness, occurs at a distance of
300 pc from the core, coincident with the radius of a ring observed at optical
wavelengths. Our observations add new pieces of information on the spectrum of
the radio-optical jet of 3C264, with results consistent with a synchrotron
emission mechanism and a spectrum break frequency in the infrared. Brightness
profiles taken perpendicularly to the jet of 3C264 are consistent with a spine
brightened jet at distances below 100 pc from the core, and an edge-brightened
jet beyond, which can be interpreted as evidence of a transverse jet velocity
structure. Our observations do not allow us to distinguish between the presence
of a face--on dust and gas disk at the center of the host galaxy of 3C264, or
rather an evacuated bubble. However, the properties of the jet structure, the
changes in the polarization angle, and the plausible jet orientation can be
naturally brought into agreement in the bubble scenario.

currents through a surface of constant entropy (circulation luminosity) is
shown to be positive. The corresponding decrease in the temperature gradient is
important in the secondary of contact binaries. This result removes the
deadlock in the theory of contact binaries. The resulting treatment of contact
binaries is investigated, assuming thermal equilibrium. If the circulation
luminosity is adjusted to give a prescribed temperature difference between the
components, details turn out to be unimportant. The temperature difference is
bound to be positive. The fractional extent of radiative regions is larger in
the secondary than in the primary. In the course of evolution the period
increases and the mass ratio decreases. A survey of unevolved and evolved
contact configurations is presented. Observational tests are passed. In stable
systems the degree of contact is small. Stable systems in the period-colour
diagram, unevolved and evolved, cover the strip of observed systems. Lower
limits for period and effective temperature, compatible with the observed
limits, are caused by the requirement of thermal stability. Stable systems with
mass ratios very close to unity are possible, in accordance with recent
observations. These results support the assumption of thermal equilibrium as
well as the treatment of the stability problem. Models for individual observed
systems are well-determined and can be used to calibrate the efficiency of the
energy transfer between the components and to determine metallicity and age.
The results show that evolutionary effects are important and that the
efficiency is very small.

significantly above the observational scatter, several abundance ratios present
an amazing low scatter when plotted against [Fe/H], as [Cr/Fe] but also odd

using Mg instead of Fe as reference element. With Mg, no clear trend with
metallicity is obvious below [Mg/H]=-3., except perhaps for [Zn/Mg]. It is
contemplated that the mild slope found in the very low scatter diagram [Cr/Fe]
versus [Fe/H] might be spurious due for example to the LTE approximation plus
use of 1-D models. This would relax the absence of scatter in the dilution of
the SN ejectas within the ambient medium, as needed if [Fe/H] is a well defined

universal radial density profile. The origin of the profile is still under
debate. We investigate this topic and pay particular attention to the velocity
dispersion profile. To this end we have performed high-resolution simulations
with two independent codes, ART and {\sc Gadget}. The radial velocity
dispersion can be approximated as function of the potential by $\sigma_r^2 = a
(\Phi / \Phi_{\rm{out}})^\kappa (\Phi_{\rm{out}} - \Phi)$, where
$\Phi_{\rm{out}}$ is the outer potential of the halo. For the parameters $a$
and $\kappa$ we find $a=0.29\pm0.04$ and $\kappa=0.41\pm0.03$. We find that the
power-law asymptote $\sigma^2 \propto \Phi^\kappa$ is valid out to much larger
distances from the halo center than any power asymptote for the density profile
$\rho \propto r^{-n}$. The asymptotic slope $n(r \to 0)$ of the density profile
is related to the exponent $\kappa$ via $n=2\kappa/(1+\kappa)$. Thus the value
obtained for $\kappa$ from the available simulation data can be used to obtain
an estimate of the density profile below presently resolved scales. We predict
a continuously decreasing $n$ towards the halo center with the asymptotic value
$n \lesssim 0.58$ at $r=0$.

low-energy steepening (Delta alpha_x ~ 0.9) which is likely due to the
synchrotron component merging into the inverse Compton one around ~ 2 keV. A
variable synchrotron tail would explain why the ROSAT spectra of our sources
are typically steeper than the BeppoSAX ones (Delta alpha_x} ~ 0.7). The
broad-band spectral energy distributions fully confirm this picture and model
fits using a synchrotron inverse Compton model allow us to derive the physical
parameters (intrinsic power, magnetic field, etc.) of our sources. By combining

model derived from Hooke's law that is typically used to calculate energy
levels in polarization superlattices and quantum wells. The other is a
fully-coupled strain model derived from the thermodynamic equation of state for
piezoelectric materials. The latter is more complete and applicable to strongly
piezoelectric materials where corrections to the standard model are
significant. The underlying theory has been applied to AlGaN/GaN superlattices
and quantum wells. It is found that the fully-coupled strain model yields very
different electric fields from the standard model. The calculated intersubband
transition energies are shifted by approximately 5 -- 19 meV, depending on the

fluid made of point charges which interact via Coulomb potential without any
regularization. In the framework of the grand-canonical ensemble, we use an
equivalence with a classical system of loops with random shapes, based on the
Feynman-Kac path-integral representation of the quantum Gibbs factor. After
systematic resummations of Coulomb divergences in the Mayer fugacity expansions
of loop densities, there appears a screened potential $\phi$. It obeys an
inhomogeneous Debye-H\""uckel equation with an effective screening length which
depends on the distance from the wall. The formal solution for $\phi$ can be
expanded in powers of the ratios of the de Broglie thermal wavelengths $\laa$'s
of each species $\alpha$ and the limit of the screening length far away from
the wall. In a regime of low degeneracy and weak coupling, exact analytical
density profiles are calculated at first order in two independent parameters.
Because of the vanishing of wave-functions close to the wall, density profiles
vanish gaussianly fast in the vicinity of the wall over distances $\laa$'s,
with an essential singularity in Planck constant $\hbar$. When species have
different masses, this effect is equivalent to the appearance of a quantum
surface charge localized on the wall and proportional to $\hbar$ at leading
order. Then, density profiles, as well as the electrostatic potential drop
created by the charge-density profile, also involve a term linear in $\hbar$
andwhich decays exponentially fast over the classical Debye screening length
$\xid$. The corresponding contribution to the global surface charge exactly
compensates the charge in the very vicinity of the surface, so that the net

generalization of conventional theories of flow in noncrystalline solids. As in
our earlier work, it predicts a dynamic transition between jammed and flowing
states at a yield stress. Below that yield stress, it now describes thermally
assisted creep. We show that this theory accounts for the experimentally
observed strain-rate dependence of the viscosity of metallic glasses, and that
it also captures many of the details of the transient stress-strain behavior of
those materials during loading. In particular, it explains the apparent onset
of superplasticity at sufficiently high stress as a transition between creep at
low stresses and plastic flow near the yield stress. We also argue that there
are internal inconsistencies in the conventional theories of these deformation
processes, and suggest ways in which further experimentation as well as
theoretical analysis may lead to better understanding of a broad range of
nonequilibrium phenomena.

harmonic sums up to the sums of depth~6. All relations for the sums up to
weight~6 are given in explicit form. These relations depend on the structure of
the index sets of the harmonic sums only, but not on their value. They are
therefore valid for all other mathematical objects which obey the same
multiplication relation or can be obtained as a special case thereof, as the
harmonic polylogarithms. We verify that the number of independent elements for
a given index set can be determined by counting the Lyndon words which are
associated to this set. The algebraic relations between the finite harmonic
sums can be used to reduce the high complexity of the expressions for the
Mellin moments of the Wilson coefficients and splitting functions significantly
for massless field theories as QED and QCD up to three loop and higher orders
in the coupling constant and are also of importance for processes depending on
more scales. The ratio of the number of independent sums thus obtained to the
number of all sums for a given index set is found to be $\leq 1/d$ with $d$ the
depth of the sum independently of the weight. The corresponding counting

disappears and the Gauss-Bonnet black hole is always unstable quantum
mechanically when $d \ge 6$. On the other hand, the cosmological horizon is
found always locally stable independent of the spacetime dimension. But the
solution is not globally preferred, instead the pure de Sitter space is
globally preferred. When the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient is negative, there is a
constraint on the value of the coefficient, beyond which the gravity theory is
not well defined. As a result, there is not only an upper bound on the size of
black hole horizon radius at which the black hole horizon and cosmological
horizon coincide with each other, but also a lower bound depending on the
Gauss-Bonnet coefficient and spacetime dimension. Within the physical phase
space, the black hole horizon is always thermodynamically unstable and the
cosmological horizon is always stable, further, as the case of the positive

is consistent with the argument that the pure de Sitter space corresponds to an

Hamiltonian evolution in a single state space: a continuous field of exterior
systems $\otimes_{\R} \H$. Surprisingly, the passage to the limit shows the
necessity for 3 different time scales in $H$. The limit evolution equation is
shown to spontaneously produce quantum noises terms: we obtain a quantum
Langevin equation as limit of the Hamiltonian evolution. For the very first
time, these quantum Langevin equations are obtained as the effective limit from
repeated to continuous interactions and not only as a model. These results
justify the usual quantum Langevin equations considered in continual quantum
measurement or in quantum optics. We show that the three time scales correspond
to the normal regime, the weak coupling limit and the low density limit. Our
approach allows to consider these two physical limits altogether for the first
time. Their combination produces an effective Hamiltonian on the small system,
which had never been described before. We apply these results to give an
Hamiltonian description of the von Neumann measurement. We also consider the

weakly holomorphic subbundle of a Hermitian holomorphic bundle is, by
definition, an orthogonal projection $\pi$ lying in the Sobolev space $L^2_1$
of $L^2$ sections with $L^2$ first order derivatives in the sense of
distributions, which satisfies furthermore $(\mathrm{Id}-\pi)\circ D''\pi=0$.
We give a new simple proof of the fact that a weakly holomorphic subbundle of

subbundle of $E$ in the complement of an analytic set of codimension $\geq 2.$
This result was the crucial technical argument in Uhlenbeck's and Yau's proof
of the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence on compact K\""ahler manifolds. We give
here a much simpler proof based on current theory. The idea is to construct
local meromorphic sections of $\mathrm{Im} \pi$ which locally span the fibers.

subsequently extend it via a Hartogs-type theorem of Shiffman's.

200 fs temporal resolution. The real and imaginary parts of the transient
dielectric function were calculated from absolute reflectivity of Gallium layer
measured at two different angles of incidence, using Fresnel formulas. The
time-dependent electron-phonon effective collision frequency, the heat
conduction coefficient and the volume fraction of a new phase were restored
directly from the experimental data, and the time and space dependent electron
and lattice temperatures in the layer undergoing phase transition were
reconstructed without ad hoc assumptions. We converted the temporal dependence
of the electron-phonon collision rate into the temperature dependence, and
demonstrated, for the first time, that the electron-phonon collision rate has a
non-linear character. This temperature dependence converges into the known
equilibrium function during the cooling stage. The maximum fraction of a new
phase in the laser-excited Gallium layer reached only 60% even when the
deposited energy was two times the equilibrium enthalpy of melting. We have
also demonstrated that the phase transition pace and a fraction of the
transformed material depended strongly on the thickness of the laser-excited
Gallium layer, which was of the order of several tens of nanometers for the
whole range of the pump laser fluencies up to the damage threshold. The
kinetics of the phase transformation after the laser excitation can be
understood on the basis of the classical theory of the first-order phase
transition while the duration of non-thermal stage appears to be comparable to
the sub-picosecond pulse length.

Specifically, the role of Brewster-Zennek modes appearing in metallic films
exhibiting regions of weak positive dielectric constant. It is proposed that
these modes play a significant role in the light transmission in a thin
chromium film perforated with normal cylindrical holes, for appropriate lattice
parameters.

thin metallic layers have taken a crucial importance in the context of the
results reported by Ebbesen et al, on particularly attractive optical
transmission experiments. It had been underlined that the zeroth order
transmission pattern does not depend on the polarization of the incident light
at normal incidence. In the present paper, we show that it is not the case for
rectangular holes, by contrast to the case of circular holes. In this context,
we suggest a new kind of polarizer that present the advantages brought by the
original Ebbesen devices. Assuming the recent technological interest for these
kinds of metallic gratings, such a kind of polarizer could lead to new
technological applications.

polynomial expansion of the adiabatic potential around a minimum. For several
molecules, we show that such an approximation displays an unphysical saddle
point of comparatively small energy, leading to a region where the potential is
negative and unbounded. This poses an upper limit for a reliable evaluation of
vibrational levels. We argue that the presence of such saddle points is
general.

individual gaussian attack. Consequently, non-gaussian coherent attacks do not

optimization technique, which we call the Palindrome Transform, that can be

consisting of concatenations of palindromic subcircuits. For a fixed column
ordering of two-level decomposition, we then give an numerative algorithm for
minimal (n-1)-controlled-NOT circuit construction, which we call the
Palindromic Optimization Algorithm. Our work dramatically reduces the number of

beam splitter. The theory is carried out in the Schr\""{o}dinger picture so that
the quantum nature of the two-photon interference is explicitly presented. We
find that the topological symmetry of the probability-amplitude spectrum of the
two-photon wavepacket dominates the manners of two-photon interference which
are distinguished according to increasing and decreasing the coincidence
probability for the absence of interference. However, two-photon entanglement
can be witnessed by the interference manner. We demonstrate the necessary and
sufficient conditions for the perfect two-photon interference. For a two-photon
entangled state with an anti-symmetric spectrum, it passes a 50/50 beam
splitter with the perfect transparency. The theory contributes an unified
understanding to a variety of the two-photon interference effects.

collective backscattering occurs. Using a nonlinear analysis we show that the

the non-stationary behaviour of the standard CARL model. For a proper choice of
the parameters, this steady-state can be superfluorescent.

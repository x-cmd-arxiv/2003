cluster- size halos with virial masses of 0.6-2.5x10^14/h Msun in a flat LCDM
cosmology. In agreement with previous studies,we find that the concentration of
the density distribution is tightly correlated with the halo's MAH and its
formation redshift.During the period of fast mass growth the concentration
remains approximately constant and low c_v ~ 3-4,while during the slow
accretion stages it increases with decreasing redshift as c_v ~ (1+z)^-1.We
consider fits of three widely discussed analytic density profiles to the
simulated clusters focusing on the most relaxed inner regions.We find that
there is no unique best fit analytic profile for all the systems.If,however,a
cluster is best fit by a particular analytic profile at z=0,the same is usually
true at earlier epochs out to z ~ 1-2.The local logarithmic slope of the
density profiles at 3% of the virial radius ranges from -1.2 to -2.0,a
remarkable diversity for the relatively narrow mass range of our cluster
sample.For all the studied clusters the logarithmic slope becomes shallower
with decreasing radius without reaching an asymptotic value down to the
smallest resolved scale < ~1% of the virial radius.We do not find a clear
correlation of the inner slope with the formation redshift or the shape of the
halo's MAH.We do find, however,that during the period of rapid mass growth the
density profiles can be well described by a single power law rho(r) ~ r^-gamma
with gamma ~ 1.5-2.The relatively shallow power law slopes result in low
concentrations at these stages of evolution.This indicates that the inner power
law like density distribution of halos is built up during the periods of rapid
mass accretion and active merging,while outer steeper profile is formed when
the mass accretion is slow.

outflow. Two HH objects in the vicinity of IRAS 19395+2313 lead us to suggest
that it may also be responsible for a 5pc outflow. In total, 27 new HH
objects/complexes were discovered. Examination of these parsec-scale outflows
show that they have similar lengths, morphologies, and dynamical timescales as
those from low-mass sources. Many appear to have blown out of the parent cloud,

before adiabatic contraction most high surface brightness galaxies and some low
surface brightness galaxies are well fit by a NFW dark matter profile. However,
after adiabatic contraction, most galaxies are poorly fit in the central few
kpc. The observed angular momentum distribution in the baryonic component is
poorly matched by LambdaCDM model predictions, indicating that the angular

find that in most galaxies the dark matter distribution can be derived by
scaling up the HI gas contribution. However, we find no consistent value for
the scaling factor among all the galaxies.

transitional clusters extend the previously identified, string-like cluster
grouping, with at least one having a radial velocity consistent with the
previously found GASS velocity-longitude trend. All nine clusters lie close to
a plane tipped 17$\arcdeg$ to the Galactic plane. This planar orientation is
used to forage for additional potential cluster members in the inner Galaxy,

of a dwarf satellite galaxy on a low inclination orbit -- perhaps the GASS
system -- appears to be a plausible explanation for the origin of the outer,
old open and transitional clusters of the Milky Way. We use these clusters to
explore the age-metallicity relation of the putative accreted GASS progenitor.

relation for a very large sample of clusters show that L_X is proportional to
T^3 over the whole observable luminosity range at low redshift, but the
variance increases at low luminosity, explaining the previously claimed
steepening at low luminosity. Recent accurate cluster photometry in red and

we derive specific frequencies (S_N) ranging from ~0-9 for the galaxies.
Although the values are uncertain, seven of the galaxies appear to have

and the detached trough phenomenon. A disk outflow picture naturally explains
these features and furthermore, is using the simplest reservoir for the

using the Compton-thin assumption. We compare the Lx(2-10 keV) values with
broad optical/near-infrared emission-line luminosities, and confirm a previous

respect to their overall spectral energy distributions, as opposed to the broad

Recent observations suggest the presence of a population of old white dwarfs
with high proper motion, probably in the galactic halo, with local mass density
in the range $1.3\times 10^{-4}-4.4\times 10^{-3} M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$, in

Investigation of the signatures on microlensing results towards the LMC of

and microlensing rate of the various lens populations and then calculating
through a Montecarlo program, the probability that a lens which has caused a
microlensing event of duration $t_{\rm E}$ belongs to a certain galactic
population. Data obtained by the MACHO Collaboration allow us to set an upper
bound of $1.6\times 10^{-3} M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$ to the local mass density of
white dwarfs distributed in spheroidal models, while for white dwarfs in disk
models all values for the local mass density are in agreement with

a power-law dependence on the gas density and temperature,
$\Lambda$$\propto$$\rho^{A}T^{B}$, and the heating rate is
$\Gamma$$\propto$$\rho T$. The values of $A$ and $B$ are chosen by requiring
that the cooling time is proportional to the Hubble time in order to obtain
similarity solutions. In the region where the cooling rate is greater than the
heating rate, a cooling inflow is established, and the gas is compressed and
heats up. Because the compression is greater in the inner region than in the
outer region, the temperature becomes an increasing profile toward the center.
In particular, when a large infall velocity is produced due to an enormous
energy loss, the slope of the density approaches a value that depends on $A$,
$B$, and the velocity slope, and the slope of the temperature approaches $-$1.
On the other hand, in the region where the heating rate is greater than the
cooling rate, the infall velocity is suppressed, compression of the gas is
weakened, and the gas cools down. The slope of the density becomes shallow due
to suppression of the contraction, and the temperature is lower than that
without heating. The self-similar collapse presented here gives insights to the
effects of cooling and heating on the gas distributions in galaxies and
clusters of galaxies.

show a flat luminosity function (faint end slope $\alpha \simeq -1.1$)
consistent with that derived for galaxies in the field and groups. By contrast,
the sample of Abell clusters that do not have an X-ray counterpart shows a
galaxy luminosity function with a steep faint end ($\alpha \simeq -1.6$). We
investigate the possibility that cD halos could be formed by the disruption of
galaxies in rich relaxed clusters that show an apparently flat faint end galaxy
luminosity function (Lopez-Cruz et al 1997).
  We find that clusters dominated by a central cD galaxy (Bautz-Morgan classes
I and II) show the same systematic trend: X-ray selected clusters have flatter
faint end slopes than those clusters with no detected X-ray emission. Thus, it
is likely the X-ray selection and not the cluster domination by central
galaxies what correlates with background decontamination estimates of the
galaxy luminosity function. Moreover, no significant correlation between X-ray
luminosity and the galaxy LF faint end slope is found. These results do not
support a scenario where flat faint end slopes are a consequence of cD
formation via the disruption of faint galaxies. We argue that the clusters
without X-ray emission are strongly affected by projection effects which give
rise to spurious faint end slopes estimated using background subtraction
procedures (Valotto et al 2001).

(BVRi) and three near-infrared bands (JHK_s). Galaxy types, structural

means of two-dimensional deblending of galaxy and nucleus. For the disc
dominated fraction of host galaxies (Sa and later) the optical and
optical-to-NIR colours agree well with the average colours of inactive galaxies
of same type. The bulge dominated galaxies (E/S0) on the other hand appear a
significant 0.35 mag bluer in (V-K) than their inactive counterparts, being as
blue as the discs in the sample. This trend is confirmed by fitting population
synthesis models to the extracted broad band SEDs: the stellar population age
of the bulge dominated hosts lies around a few Gyr, much younger than expected
for old evolved ellipticals. Comparison to other studies suggests a strong
trend for stellar age in elliptical host galaxies with luminosity.
Intermediately luminous elliptical hosts have comparably young populations,

interaction, the most luminous and massive ellipticals on the contrary show old
populations. The correspondence between the nuclear activity and the blue

angular dependence of unusually broad ESR spectra can be explained by the
inclusion of antisymmetric Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction, which yields
by far the largest contribution to the linewidth. However, the well-accepted
picture of only out-of-plane interdimer DM vectors is not sufficient for
explanation of the observed angular dependence. In order to account for the
experimental linewidth anisotropy we had to include sizable in-plane components
of interdimer as well as intradimer DM interaction in addition to the
out-of-plane interdimer one. The nearest-neighbor DM vectors lie perpendicular
to crystal anisotropy c-axis due to crystal symmetry. We also emphasize that
above the structural phase transition occurring at 395 K dynamical mechanism
should be present allowing for instantaneous DM interactions. Moreover, the
linewidth at an arbitrary temperature can be divided into two contributions;
namely, the first part arising from spin dynamics governed by the spin
Hamiltonian of the system and the second part due to significant spin-phonon
coupling. The nature of the latter mechanism is attributed to phonon-modulation
of the antisymmetric interaction, which is responsible for the observed linear
increase of the linewidth at high temperatures.

  conference proceedings",,,"Les cahiers du laboratoire Leibniz, n. 86, June 2003","cond-mat.dis-nn q-fin.GN",,"  We explore the effects of social influence in a simple market model in which
a large number of agents face a binary choice: 'to buy/not to buy' a single
unit of a product at a price posted by a single seller (the monopoly case). We
consider the case of 'positive externalities': an agent is more willing to buy
if the other agents with whom he/she interacts make the same decision.
  We compare two special cases known in the economics literature as the
Thurstone and the McFadden approaches. We show that they correspond to modeling
the heterogenity in individual decision rules with, respectively, annealed and
quenched disorder. More precisely the first case leads to a standard Ising
model at finite temperature in a uniform external field, and the second case to
a random field Ising model (RFIM) at zero temperature.
  Considering the optimisation of profit by the seller within the McFadden/RFIM
model in the mean field limit, we exhibit a new first order phase transition:
if the social influence is strong enough, there is a regime where, if the mean
willingness to pay increases, or if the production costs decrease, the optimal
solution for the seller jumps from one with a high price and a small number of
buyers, to another one with a low price and a large number of buyers.

show that the corresponding wave fronts of the classical solutions propagate
causally. Furthermore, for (s,0)+(0,s) representations, the formalism predicts
the correct gyromagnetic factor, g_{s}=1/s. The advocated method allows to
describe any higher spin without auxiliary conditions and by one covariant

the zero momentum modes enhancement effect in the true QCD vacuum. Its
existence exhibits a characteristic mass (the so-called mass gap), which is
responsible for the scale of nonperturbative dynamics in the QCD ground state.
The theory of distributions, complemented by the dimensional regularization
method, allows one to put severe infrared singularities under firm mathematical
control. By an infrared renormalization of a mass gap only, the infrared
structure of the full gluon propagator is exactly reduced to the simplest
severe infrared singularity, the famous $(q^2)^{-2}$. So, the smooth in the
infrared limit the full gluon propagator is to be ruled out. Collective motion
of all the purely transverse $virtual$ gluon field configurations with
low-frequency components/large scale amplitudes is solely responsible for the
color confinement phenomenon within our approach. At the microscopic, dynamical
level these field configurations are saturated by the nonlinear fundamental
four-gluon interaction. It just makes the full gluon propagator inevitably so
singular in the infrared. The amplitudes of all the purely transversre severely
singular $actual$ gluon field configurations are totally suppressed, leading
thus to the confinement of gluons. We formulate exactly the gluon confinement

their generating function is obtained. These polynomials are also martingales

the Kailath-Segall polynomials. These are multivariate polynomials, which share
with the Appell polynomials nice combinatorial properties, but are always

model, the conditional probability that a particular gate fails, given the
failure status of any subset of gates preceding it in the network, is bounded
from above by some $\epsilon$. We show that if we pick a Boolean network with
$n$ gates at random according to the Barak-Erd\H{o}s model of a random acyclic
digraph, such that the expected edge density is $c n^{-1}\log n$, and if
$\epsilon$ is equal to a certain function of the size of the largest reflexive,
transitive closure of a vertex (with respect to a particular realization of the
random digraph), then Pippenger's model exhibits a phase transition at $c=1$.
Namely, with probability $1-o(1)$ as $n\to\infty$, we have the following: for
$0 \le c \le 1$, the minimum of the probability that no gate has failed, taken
over all probability distributions of gate failures consistent with Pippenger's
model, is equal to $o(1)$, whereas for $c >1$ it is equal to
$\exp(-\frac{c}{e(c-1)}) + o(1)$. We also indicate how a more refined analysis
of Pippenger's model, e.g., for the purpose of estimating probabilities of

arbitrary groups is the so-called conjugacy search problem (sometimes
erroneously called just the conjugacy problem): given two elements a, b of a
group G and the information that a^x=b for some x \in G, find at least one
particular element x like that. Here a^x stands for xax^{-1}. The computational
difficulty of this problem in some particular groups has been used in several
group based cryptosystems. Recently, a few preprints have been in circulation
that suggested various ""neighbourhood search"" type heuristic attacks on the
conjugacy search problem. The goal of the present survey is to stress a
(probably well known) fact that these heuristic attacks alone are not a threat
to the security of a cryptosystem, and, more importantly, to suggest a more
credible approach to assessing security of group based cryptosystems. Such an
approach should be necessarily based on the concept of the average case
complexity (or expected running time) of an algorithm.
  These arguments support the following conclusion: although it is generally
feasible to base the security of a cryptosystem on the difficulty of the
conjugacy search problem, the group G itself (the ""platform"") has to be chosen
very carefully. In particular, experimental as well as theoretical evidence
collected so far makes it appear likely that braid groups are not a good choice
for the platform. We also reflect on possible replacements.

In particular, we characterize the star operations of a domain arising from a
pullback of ``a general type'' by introducing new techniques for ``projecting''
and ``lifting'' star operations under surjective homomorphisms of integral
domains. We study the transfer in a pullback (or with respect to a surjective
homomorphism) of some relevant classes or distinguished properties of star
operations such as $v-, t-, w-, b-, d-,$ finite type, e.a.b., stable, and
spectral operations. We apply part of the theory developed here to give a
complete positive answer to a problem posed by D. F. Anderson in 1992
concerning the star operations on the ``$D+M$'' constructions.

to complex periodic or non periodic orbits. Performing the long time limit, we
can define ergodic averages such as Lyapunov exponents, where a negative
maximal Lyapunov exponent corresponds to a stable periodic orbit. By this,
extremely complicated periodic orbits composed of contracting and expanding
phases appear in a natural way. Employing the technique of $\epsilon$-uncertain
points, we find that values of the control parameters supporting such periodic
motion are densely embedded in a set of values for which the motion is chaotic.
When a tiny amount of noise is coupled to the system, dynamics with positive
and with negative non-trivial Lyapunov exponents are indistinguishable. We
discuss two physical systems, an oscillatory flow inside a duct and a dripping
faucet with variable water supply, where such a mechanism seems to be
responsible for a complicated alternation of laminar and turbulent phases.

rotating strange stars in general relativity. A triaxial, ""bar shaped"" compact
star could be an efficient source of continuous wave gravitational radiation in
the frequency range of the forthcoming interferometric detectors. We locate the
secular instability point along several constant baryon mass sequences of
uniformly rotating strange stars described by the MIT bag model. Contrary to
neutron stars, strange stars with T/|W| (the ratio of the rotational kinetic
energy to the absolute value of the gravitational potential energy) much lower
than the corresponding value for the mass-shed limit can be secularly unstable
to bar mode formation if shear viscosity is high enough to damp out any
deviation from uniform rotation. The instability develops for a broad range of
gravitational masses and rotational frequencies of strange quark stars. It
imposes strong constraints on the lower limit of the frequency at the innermost
stable circular orbit around rapidly rotating strange stars. The above results
are robust for all linear self-bound equations of state assuming the growth
time of the instability is faster than the damping timescale. We discuss
astrophysical scenarios where triaxial instabilities (r-mode and viscosity
driven instability) could be relevant in strange stars described by the
standard MIT bag model of normal quark matter. Taking into account actual
values of viscosities in strange quark matter and neglecting the magnetic field
we show that Jacobi-like instability cannot develop in any astrophysicaly
interesting temperature windows. The main result is that strange quark stars
described by the MIT bag model can be accelerated to very high frequency in Low
Mass X-ray binaries if the strange quark mass is ~ 200 MeV or higher.

collimated protostellar outflow with a molecular condensation ~15000 AU from
the central protostar is clearly traced by molecular species such as HCN, SiO,
SO, CS, and CH3OH. Especially SiO traces a narrow high velocity component at
the interface between the outflow and the molecular condensation.
Multi-transition single-dish observations are used to distinguish the chemistry
of the shock from that of the molecular condensation and to address the
physical conditions therein. Statistical equilibrium calculations reveal
temperatures of 20 and 70 K for the quiescent and shocked components,
respectively, and densities near 10^6 cm^{-3}. Significant abundance
enhancements of two to four orders of magnitude are found in the shocked region
for molecules such as CH3OH, SiO and the sulfur-bearing molecules. HCO+ is seen
only in the aftermath of the shock consistent with models where it is destroyed
through release of H2O from grain mantles in the shock. N2H+ shows narrow
lines, not affected by the outflow but rather probing the ambient cloud.
Differences in abundances of HCN, H2CO and CS are seen between different
outflow regions and are suggested to be related to differences in the atomic
carbon abundance. Compared to the warm inner parts of protostellar envelopes,
higher abundances of in particular CH3OH and SiO are found in the outflows,

bulk motion. We assumed a precession period of 10.1 yr, which is one of the
B-band light curve long-term periods reported in the literature. We propose
that boosting of the underlying jet emission, which is time-dependent due to
precession, is responsible for this long-term optical variability. Jet
precession with periods of several years can be produced in super-massive black
hole binary systems, when the secondary black hole is in an orbit non-coplanar
with the primary accretion disk, inducing torques in the inner parts of the
disk. Assuming that this mechanism is responsible for the jet precession in 3C
345, we estimate upper and lower limits for the masses of the two black holes,
as well as their mean separation. We found a correlation between the formation
of jet components and the occurrence of strong optical flares, as well as a
very strong anti-correlation between the intensity of these flares and the time

non-significantly AGN-contaminated clusters: A2142, A2199, A2256, A3376, Coma,
Ophiuchus and Virgo. The data are consistent with a scenario whereby relaxed
clusters have no hard X-ray component of non-thermal origin, whereas merger
clusters do, with a 20-80 keV luminosity of 10^(43-44) erg/s. The co-added
spectrum of the above clusters indicates a power-law spectrum for the HXR with
a photon index of 2.8+0.3-0.4 in the 12-115 keV band, and we find indication
that it has extended distribution. These indications argue against significant
contamination from obscured AGN, which have harder spectra and centrally
concentrated distribution. These results are supportive of the assumption of
the merger shock acceleration of electrons in clusters. Assuming that the
Cosmic Microwave Background photons experience Inverse Compton scattering from
the merger-accelerated relativistic electrons, and thus produce the observed
HXR, the measured hard X-ray slope corresponds to a differential momentum
spectra of the relativistic electrons with a slope of mu = 3.8-5.0. The
observed slope of HXR is also consistent with that predicted by the non-thermal
bremsstrahlung, which thus cannot be ruled by the fit to the current data, even
though this model requires an extreme, untenable cluster energetics. Assuming
centrally concentrated distribution of HXR, the data requires a harder slope
for the HXR spectrum, which is consistent with secondary electron models, but
this model yields a worse fit to the PDS data and thus seems to be disfavored
over the primary electron Inverse Compton model.

is a useful quantitative measure of the strength of nonaxisymmetric
perturbations in disk galaxies. Here we consider the distribution of this
ratio, called Qg, for a statistically well-defined sample of 180 spiral
galaxies from the Ohio State University Bright Galaxy Survey and the Two Micron
All-Sky Survey. Qg is derived from gravitational potentials inferred from
near-infrared images under the assumptions of a constant mass-to-light ratio
and an exponential vertical density law. In order to derive the most reliable
maximum relative torques, orientation parameters based on blue-light isophotes
are used to deproject the galaxies, and the more spherical shapes of bulges are
taken into account using two-dimensional decompositions which allow for
analytical fits to bulges, disks, and bars. Also, vertical scaleheights hz are
derived by scaling the radial scalelengths hR from the two-dimensional
decompositions allowing for the type dependence of hR/hz indicated by optical
and near-infrared studies of edge-on spiral galaxies. The impact of dark matter
is assessed using a ""universal rotation curve"" parametrization, and is found to
be relatively insignificant for our sample. In agreement with a previous study
by Block et al. (2002), the distribution of maximum relative gravitational
torques is asymmetric towards large values and shows a deficiency of low Qg
galaxies. However, due to the above refinements, our distribution shows more
low Qg galaxies than Block et al. We also find a significant type-dependence in
maximum relative gravitational torques, in the sense that Qg is lower on
average in early-type spirals compared to late-type spirals.

the dark matter annihilation signal may be expected. We calculate the flux of
high energy gamma-rays from annihilation of neutralino dark matter in the
centre of the Milky Way and the three nearest dwarf spheroidals (Sagittarius,
Draco and Canis Major), using realistic models of the dark matter distribution.
Other investigators have used cusped dark halo profiles (such as the
Navarro-Frenk-White) to claim a significant signal. This ignores the
substantial astrophysical evidence that the Milky Way is not dark-matter
dominated in the inner regions. We show that the annihilation signal from the
Galactic Centre falls by two orders of magnitude on substituting a cored dark
matter density profile for a cusped one. The present and future generation of
high energy gamma-ray detectors, whether atmospheric Cerenkov telescopes or
space missions like GLAST, lack the sensitivity to detect any of the
monochromatic gamma-ray annihilation lines. The continuum gamma-ray signal
above 1 GeV and above 50 GeV may however be detectable either from the dwarf
spheroidals or from the Milky Way itself. If the density profiles of the dwarf
spheroidals are cusped, then the best prospects are for detecting Sagittarius
and Canis Major. However, if the dwarf spheroidals have milder, cored profiles,
then the annihilation signal is not detectable. For GLAST, an attractive
strategy is to exploit the wide field of view and observe the Milky Way at
medium latitudes, as suggested by Stoehr et al. This is reasonably robust
against changes in the density profile.

growth histories into two categories: the accretion category contains halos
whose mass has varied continuously and smoothly, while the merger category
contains halos which have undergone sudden and significant mass variations
(greater than 1/3 of their initial mass per event). We observe for the growth
of angular momentum that it continues well into the nonlinear regime, that it
is correlated with mass growth and that it occurs in two phases: a fast
followed by a slow phase. The spin parameter decreases with time for the
accretion catalog whereas slightly increases for the merger catalog, but does
not change when two catalogs are considered together, and furthermore it does
not depend on halo mass or cosmological model. We also develop a simple model
for the formation of a disk galaxy similar to Milky Way, and conclude that our
own halo must have captured satellites in order to acquire the required angular
momentum and to achieve most of the disk around z ~ 1.6. Angular momentum
distribution indicates that at z ~ 1.6 only 22% of the halos have angular
momentum of magnitude comparable to that of disk galaxies in the mass range of

matter particles. Other possible explanations for this signal are associated
with stellar objects, such as hypernovae. In order to distinguish between
annihilating light dark matter scenario and more conventional astrophysical
sources for the bulge emission, we here propose the study of dwarf spheroidals
such as Sagittarius. These galaxies have typical luminosities of $10^5 L_\odot$
but mass-to-light ratios of $\sim 100$. As there are comparatively few stars,
the prospects for 511 keV emission from standard astrophysical scenarios are
minimal. The dwarf spheroidals do, however, contain copious amounts of dark
matter. INTEGRAL/SPI has observed the Sagittarius region. Analysis of this data
for 511 keV emission will provide a test of MeV dark matter which can
distinguish between annihilating dark matter and more standard astrophysics.
The observation of such a signal from Sagittarius should be a ``smoking gun''
for MeV dark matter.

the total emission at 7 and 15 microns is diffuse, originating from the
interacting disks of the galaxies. Moreover, they indicate the presence of
large amounts of hot dust in the main infrared sources of the system and large
extinctions toward the nuclei. While the observed spectra have an overall
similar shape, mainly composed of Unidentified Infrared Bands (UIB) in the
short wavelength domain, a strong continuum at ~ 13 microns and a deep silicate
absorption band at 10 microns, their differences reveal the varying physical
conditions of each component. For each source, the spectral energy distribution
(SED) can be reproduced by a linear combination of a UIB ""canonical"" spectral
template and a hot dust continuum due to a 230-300 K black body, after
independently applying an extinction correction to both of them. We find that
the UIB extinction does not vary much throughout the system (A_V ~ 5 mag)
suggesting that most UIBs originate from less enshrouded regions. IC694 appears
to dominate the infrared emission of the system and our observations support
the interpretation of a deeply embedded nuclear starburst located behind an
absorption of about 40 mag. The central region of NGC3690 displays a hard
radiation field characterized by a [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio > 1.8. It also hosts a
strong continuum from 5 to 16 microns which can be explained as thermal
emission from a deeply embedded (A_V ~ 60 mag) compact source, consistent with
the mid-infrared signature of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), and in

  A toy model is used to study the formation of sheets of the cosmic web, from
which DM haloes form later. This model demonstrates the interplay between phase
mixing and violent relaxation that must also be characteristic of spherical
collapse. In the limit that sheets contain arbitrarily many particles, it seems
that power-law profiles are established in both distance and energy. When only
a finite number of particles is employed, relaxation is prematurely terminated
and the power laws are broken. In a given simulation, the sheets with the
highest peak phase-space densities are those that form from the longest waves.
Hence simulations with little small-scale power are expected to form the

impurities and can be described by the Anderson model. Within this model,
hybridization of d-orbitals and p-orbitals gives rise to a non-RKKY indirect
exchange mechanism, when the localized d-electrons are exchanged through both
conduction and valence bands. For semiconductors with indirect band gap the
non-RKKY part of exchange integral is antiferromagnetic, which suppresses
ferromagnetism. In case of direct band gap, this exchange mechanism can, under
certain conditions, lead to enhancement of ferromagnetism. The indirect
exchange intergral is much stronger than RKKY, and can be sufficiently long
range. Thus, a potentially new class of high-temperature magnetic
semiconductors emerges, where doped carriers are not necessary to mediate
ferromagnetism. Curie temperatures in such magnetic semiconductors are
determined mostly by the interaction between localized impurities, not Zener
mechanism. This effect could also be responsible for unusually high Curie
temperatures in some magnetic semiconductors with direct band gap, such as
GaMnAs.

this model may properly be referred to as a skeleton approximate solution of
the Einstein field equations. The approximation is based on a conformally flat
truncation, which excludes gravitational radiation, as well as a removal of
some additional gravitational field energy. After these two simplifications,
only source terms proportional to Dirac delta distributions remain in the
constraint equations. The skeleton Hamiltonian is exact in the test-body limit,
it leads to the Einsteinian dynamics up to the first post-Newtonian
approximation, and in the time-symmetric limit it gives the energy of the
Brill-Lindquist solution exactly. The skeleton model for binary systems may be
regarded as a kind of analytical counterpart to the numerical treatment of
orbiting Misner-Lindquist binary black holes proposed by Gourgoulhon,
Grandclement, and Bonazzola, even if they actually treat the corotating case.
Along circular orbits, the two-black-hole skeleton solution is quasi-stationary
and it fulfills the important property of equality of Komar and ADM masses.
Explicit calculations for the determination of the last stable circular orbit
of the binary system are performed up to the tenth post-Newtonian order within
the skeleton model.

the motion of a particle along a curvilinear trajectory is considered. The
transformations of the correlation tensor components for a system of two
spin-1/2 particles at the transition from the c.m.s. of the particle pair to
the laboratory frame are investigated. When the particle laboratory velocities
are not colinear, the relativistic spin rotation angles for these particles are
different. As a result, the relative fractions of the singlet and triplet
states in the relativistic system of two free spin-1/2 particles with a nonzero
vector of relative momentum depend on the concrete frame in which this
two-particle system is analyzed.

representation, based on a c=-2 \eta\xi ghost system, and a Lorentzian boson.
It turns out that there are several ``versions'' of the \eta\xi system,
allowing different su(2)_{-1/2} theories. This is explored here in details. In
more technical terms, we consider extensions (in the c=-2 language) from the
small to the large algebra representation and, in a further step, to the full
symplectic fermion theory. In each case, the results are expressed in terms of
su(2)_{-1/2} representations. At the first new layer (large algebra),
continuous representations appear which are interpreted in terms of relaxed
modules. At the second step (symplectic formulation), we recover a logarithmic
theory with its characteristic signature, the occurrence of indecomposable
representations. To determine whether any of these three versions of the
su(2)_{-1/2} WZW is well-defined, one conventionally requires the construction
of a modular invariant. This issue, however, is plagued with various
difficulties, as we discuss.

notable feature of the spectral triple is that its corresponding zeta functions
have multiple poles, while in the classical elliptic cases only simple poles
appear for the zeta functions.
  We show that the multiplicities of the poles of the zeta functions have an

We give a correspondence between solutions of the -1 flow equation associated
to a compact Lie group $G$ and wave maps into $G$. We use B\""acklund
transformations to construct explicit $2k$-soliton breather solutions for the
-1 flow equation and show that the corresponding wave maps are periodic and
homoclinic. The compact symmetric space $G/K$ can be embedded as a totally
geodesic submanifold of $G$ via the Cartan embedding. We prescribe the
constraint condition for the -1 flow equation associated to $G$ which insures
that the corresponding wave map into $G$ actually lies in $G/K$. For example,
when $G/K=SU(2)/SO(2)=S^2$, the constrained -1-flow equation associated to
SU(2) has the sine-Gordon equation (SGE) as a subequation and classical
breather solutions of the SGE are 2-soliton breathers. Thus our result
generalizes the result of Shatah and Strauss that a classical breather solution
of the SGE gives rise to a periodic homoclinic wave map to $S^2$. When the
group $G$ is non-compact, the bi-invariant metric on $G$ is pseudo-Riemannian
and B\""acklund transformations of a smooth solution often are singular. We use
B\""acklund transformations to show that there exist smooth initial data with
constant boundary conditions and finite energy such that the Cauchy problem for
wave maps from $R^{1,1}$ to the pseudo-Riemannian manifold $SL(2,R)$ develops

an auxiliary elliptic operator P), as determined in a joint work with Seeley
1995. The definition of TR A is extended from the cases of noninteger order, or
integer order and even-even parity on odd-dimensional manifolds, to the case of
even-odd parity on even-dimensional manifolds.
  For the generalized zeta function \zeta (A,P,s)=\Tr(AP^{-s}), extended
meromorphically to C, C_0(A,P) equals the coefficient of s^0 in the Laurent
expansion at s=0 when P is invertible. In the mentioned parity cases, \zeta
(A,P,s) is regular at all integer points. The higher Laurent coefficients
C_j(A,P) at s=0 are described as leading nonlocal coeficients C_0(B,P) in trace
expansions of resolvent expressions B(P-\lambda)^{-N}, with B
log-polyhomogeneous as defined by Lesch (here -C_1(I,P)=C_0(\log P,P) gives the

improve B3LYP functional by taking into account of high-order contributions to

a neural network whose structure and synaptic weights are determined from 116
known experimental atomization energies, ionization potentials, proton
affinities or total atomic energies which were used by Becke in his pioneer
work on the hybrid functionals [J. Chem. Phys. ${\bf 98}$, 5648 (1993)]. It
leads to better agreement between the first-principles calculation results and
these 116 experimental data. The new B3LYP functional is further tested by
applying it to calculate the ionization potentials of 24 molecules of the G2
test set. The 6-311+G(3{\it df},2{\it p}) basis set is employed in the
calculation, and the resulting root-mean-square error is reduced to 2.2
kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$ in comparison to 3.6 kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$ of

spectral density function is therefore inversely proportional to the cubes of
its wavelengths. For its energy to be finite, there must exist a minimum
wavelength, $q_\lambda$. The measurements of the apparent attraction between
two uncharged conductor plates, placed in a vacuum at a temperature close to
absolute zero, made by Sparnaay in 1958 allow us to deduce that the energy flow
of the zero-point radiation which comes of or into an area $(q_\lambda)^2$,
corresponds with the emission of one photon of wavelength $q_\lambda$ per
$q_\tau$ $(q_\tau=q_\lambda/c)$, plus one photon of wavelength $2q_\lambda$ per
$2^3q_\tau$, etc., up to one photon of wavelength $nq_\lambda$ per $n^3q_\tau$.
This energy flow is enormous, but Sparnaay's experiments implied only photons
whose wavelengths were greater than $5\times10^{-5}$ cm, and zero-point
radiation may include only photons with wavelengths greater than $xq_\lambda$,
being $x$ an integer, perhaps very great.

landscape of protein folding. Consideration of both typical range of
stabilising interactions, and folding rates themselves, leads to a model of the
energy hypersurface that is characterised by the structure of diffusive
""hypergutters"" as well as the familiar ""funnels"". Several general predictions
result: (1) intermediate subspaces of configurations will always be visited;
(2) specific but non-native interactions are important in stabilising these
low-dimensional diffusive searches on the folding pathway; (3) sequential
barriers will commonly be found, even in ""two-state""proteins; (4) very early
times will show charactreristic departures from single-exponential kinetics;
(5) contributions of non-native interactions to phi-values are calculable, and
may be significant. The example of a three-helix bundle is treated in more
detail as an illustration. The model also shows that high-dimensional
structures provide conceptual relations between the ""folding funnel"",
""diffusion-collision"", ""nucleation-condensation"" and ""topomer search"" models of
protein folding. It suggests that kinetic strategies for fast folding may be
encoded rather generally in non-native, rather than native interactions. The
predictions are related to very recent findings in experiment and simulation.

curvature in DNA can result from a geometric mismatch between the specific
backbone length and optimal base stacking orientations. It predicted that the
curvature in A-tract repeats can be relaxed by introducing single stranded
breaks (nicks). This effect has not been tested earlier and it would not be
accounted for by alternative models of DNA bending. Here the curvature in a
specifically designed series of nicked DNA fragments is tested experimentally
by gel mobility assays and, simultaneously, by free molecular dynamics
simulations. Single stranded breaks produce virtually no effect upon the gel
mobility of the random sequence DNA. In contrast, nicked A-tract fragments
reveal a regular modulation of curvature depending upon the position of the
strand break with respect to the overall bend. Maximal relaxation is observed
when nicks occur inside A-tracts. The results are partially reproduced in
simulations. Analysis of computed curved DNA conformations reveals a group of
sugar atoms that exhibit reduced backbone length within A-tracts, which can
correspond to the compression hypothesis.

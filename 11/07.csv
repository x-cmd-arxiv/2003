data that we acquired with the ISO instruments PHOT and LWS. Several previously
undetected deeply embedded sources are found in the vicinity of our targets. We
determine temperatures and luminosities of seven objects and locate them on a
Lbol-Tbol diagram - the equivalent to a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for
protostars. Their masses and ages, according to their location on tracks taken
from our evolutionary model, are derived. L1211 and CepE appear to be
intermediate mass objects which will reach final masses of about 3Mo, while the
other sources are in or below the solar mass range. The derived ages of 15000
to 30000yr are consistent with their current Class0 state. A comparison of the
luminosity of the associated outflows in the 1-0S(1) line of molecular hydrogen
with the source properties (bolometric luminosity, bolometric temperature, and
envelope mass) of 16 Class0 sources shows no statistically significant
correlations. Nevertheless, the data are consistent with a scheme in which the
outflow strength and protostar evolve simultaneously. We show that the
relationship is partially disguised, however, by the local properties of the
surrounding material, the extinction, and short-term flux variability.

required to extract information on the physical and chemical evolution of these
ices. Both laboratory simulations and line of sight studies are essential.
Examples are given for ice bands observed toward high mass protostars, fields
stars and recent work on ices in disks surrounding low mass protostars. A
number of clear trends have emerged in recent years. One prominent ice
component consists of an intimate mixture between H2O, CH3OH and CO2 molecules.
Apparently a stable balance exists between low temperature hydrogenation and
oxidation reactions on grain surfaces. In contrast, an equally prominent ice
component, consisting almost entirely of CO, must have accreted directly from
the gas phase. Thermal processing, i.e. evaporation and crystallization, proves
to be readily traceable in both these ice components. The spectroscopic
signatures of energetic processing by cosmic rays and high energy photons from
nearby protostars are weaker and not as well understood. A fundamental
limitation in detecting complex, energetically produced (and also some simple)
species is blending of weak features in the spectra of protostars.
Sophisticated techniques are required to extract information from blended
features. We conclude with a summary of key goals for future research and
prospects for observations of ices using future instrumentation, including
SIRTF/IRS.

the shape of the gravitational potential. This circumstance can be used to
constrain the total mass (including the dark matter halo) of nearly face-on
dwarf irregulars. We consider two models of Ho I, which differ by an assumed
mass of the dark matter halo M_h. The contrast in HI surface density between
the central HI depression and the ring, as well as the lack of gas expansion in
the central hole, are better reproduced by the model with a massive halo of
M_h=6.0*10^9 M_sun than by that with a small halo of M_h=4.0*10^8 M_sun,
implying that Ho I is halo-dominated. Assuming the halo mass of 6.0*10^9 M_sum,
we determine the mechanical energy required to form the observed ring equal to

code for starless molecular cloud cores heated by an external isotropic or

temperature distribution inside model clouds with specified but arbitrary

clouds, axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric toroids, and clouds heated by an
external stellar source in addition to the general interstellar field. For
these configurations, the code also computes maps of the emergent intensity at
different wavelengths and arbitrary viewing angle, that can be compared
directly with continuum maps of prestellar cores. In the approximation where
the dust temperature is independent of interactions with the gas and where the
gas is heated both by collisions with dust grains and ionization by cosmic
rays, the temperature distribution of the gas is also calculated. For cloud
models with parameters typical of dense cores, the results show that the dust
temperature decreases monotonically from a maximum value near the cloud's edge
(14-15 K) to a minimum value at the cloud's center (6-7 K). Conversely, the gas
temperature varies in a similar range, but, due to efficient dust-gas coupling
in the inner regions and inefficient cosmic-ray heating in the outer regions,
the gradient is non-monotonic and the gas temperature reaches a maximum value
at intermediate radii. The emission computed for these models (at 350 micron
and 1.3 mm) shows that deviations from spherical symmetry in the density and/or
temperature distributions are generally reduced in the simulated intensity maps

with C and N, or production of these elements in the AGB phase of a formerly
more massive companion, which is now a white dwarf. However, significant radial
velocity variations have not been detected within the 52 days covered by our

shows an interesting morphological structure within the galaxy, clearly
associated with the central regions of active star-formation. Of the two main
regions of star-formation in this galaxy, X-ray emission associated with the
older is identified whereas little is detected from the younger, providing an
insight into the evolutionary process of the formation of superbubbles around
young stellar clusters. The spectra of the diffuse emission from the galaxy can

metallicity of Complex C gas toward PG1259+593 is approximately 1/6 solar, as
inferred from the oxygen abundance [O/H] = -0.79 (+0.12, -0.16). While we
cannot rule out a value of D/H similar to that found for the local ISM, we can
confidently exclude values as low as those determined recently for extended
sight lines in the Galactic disk. Combined with the sub-solar metallicity
estimate and the low nitrogen abundance, this conclusion lends support to the
hypothesis that Complex C is located outside the Milky Way, rather than inside
in material recirculated between the Galactic disk and halo. The value of D/H
for Complex C is consistent with the primordial abundance of deuterium inferred
from recent Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe observations of the cosmic
microwave background and simple chemical evolution models that predict the
amount of deuterium astration as a function of metallicity. [Abbreviated

investigate how the distribution of star-forming regions in these galaxies is
related to galaxy interactions. Based on correlation diagrams between H-alpha
flux and continuum emission for individual galaxies, a sequence for the
distribution of star-forming regions was found: very compact (~100 pc) nuclear
starbursts with almost no star-forming activity in the outer regions (type 1),
dominant nuclear starbursts < 1 kpc in size and a negligible contribution from
the outer regions (type 2), nuclear starbursts > 1 kpc in size and a
significant contribution from the outer regions (type 3), and extended
starbursts with relatively faint nuclei (type 4). These classes of star-forming
region were found to be strongly related to global star-forming properties such
as star-formation efficiency, far-infrared color, and dust extinction. There
was a clear tendency for the objects with more compact distributions of
star-forming regions to show a higher star-formation efficiency and hotter
far-infrared color. An appreciable fraction of the sample objects were
dominated by extended starbursts (type 4), which is unexpected in the standard
scenario of interaction-induced starburst galaxies. We also found that the
distribution of star-forming regions was weakly but clearly related to galaxy
morphology: severely disturbed objects had a more concentrated distribution of
star-forming regions. This suggests that the properties of galaxy interactions,
such as dynamical phase and orbital parameters, play a more important role than
the internal properties of progenitor galaxies, such as dynamical structure or
gas mass fraction. We also discuss the evolution of the distribution of
star-forming regions in interacting galaxies.

Accuracy of the CPP during this kind of operation was about 3% and the

measured the current pumped through the array by rotating around the degeneracy

of a quantum system consisting of a non-ideal two level subspace, identified as

The whole system is under interaction with an environmental bath through a
Caldeira-Leggett type coupling. The model interaction we use can generate
nonnegligible couplings between the qubit states and the higher levels upto
$N\sim 10$. In contrast to the pure two-level system, in a multilevel system
the quantum information may leak out of the qubit subspace through nonresonant
as well as resonant excitations induced by the environment. The decoherence
properties of the qubit subspace is examined numerically using the master
equation formalism of the system's reduced density matrix. We numerically
examine the relaxation and dephasing times as the environmental frequency
spectrum, the environmental temperature, and the multilevel system parameters
are varied. We observe the influence of all energy scales in the noise spectrum
on the short time dynamics implying the dominance of nonresonant transitions at
short times. The relaxation and dephasing times calculated, strongly depend on
$N$ for $4< N<10$ and saturate for $10 <N$. We also examine double degenerate
systems with $4 \le N$ and observe a strong suppression (almost by two orders
of magnitude) of the low temperature relaxation and dephasing rates.
  An important observation for $4 \le N$ in doubly degenerate energy
configuration is that, we find a strong suppression of the RD rates for such
systems relative to the singly degenerate ones. These results are also compared
qualitatively with the relaxation rates found from the Fermi Golden Rule.

in the transverse region relative to the parallel region, which is in turn
dissipated by net motion of the boundary toward the transverse region. The
observed boundary motion is a combination of rigid advection by the flow and
order parameter diffusion. The latter includes break up and reconnection of
lamellae, as well as a weak Eckhaus instability in the boundary region for
sufficiently large strain amplitude that leads to slow wavenumber readjustment.

particular variant of this approach, known as the entropic lattice Boltzmann

dependency of the hysteresis loop on the frequency. In order to determine the
influence of the defects on the domain switching dynamics the samples were
characterized in the virgin state and after a fatigue or a depinning process.
The frequency dependence of the polarization revealed a strong relaxation of
the 90 domain walls at 100 Hz. The results also revealed a strong influence of
the kind of defect and their distribution into the ferroelectric matrix on the
domain switching dynamics, which reflected in the frequency dependence of the
coercive field and the percentage of the backswitching. Initially, it was
observed that the frequency dependence of the coercive field for the soft and
the hard PZT in the virgin state had just one rate of change per decade in all
frequency range investigated, which is the standard behavior found in the
literature. However, after the fatigue or the depinning process two rates of
changes were noticed. Consequently, an evidence of an upper frequency limit for
the coercive field changes was found. The percentage of the backswitching and
its behavior for the soft PZT was almost independent of the fatigue state in
all frequency range investigated. Nevertheless, for the hard PZT an opposite
behavior was verified. The reorientation of the domains was modeled as
occurring in a viscous medium where several forces such as viscous and
restoring forces act on them.

precession, parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$,
and the constancy of the gravitational constant {\it G}. Since the beginning of
the experiment in 1969, the uncertainties of these tests have decreased
considerably as data accuracies have improved and data time span has
lengthened. We are exploring the modeling improvements necessary to proceed
from cm to mm range accuracies enabled by the new Apache Point Observatory
Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) currently under development in New
Mexico. This facility will be able to make a significant contribution to the
solar system tests of fundamental and gravitational physics. In particular, the
Weak and Strong Equivalence Principle tests would have a sensitivity
approaching 10$^{-14}$, yielding sensitivity for the SEP violation parameter
$\eta$ of $\sim 3\times 10^{-5}$, $v^2/c^2$ general relativistic effects would
be tested to better than 0.1%, and measurements of the relative change in the
gravitational constant, $\dot{G}/G$, would be $\sim0.1$% the inverse age of the
universe. Having this expected accuracy in mind, we discusses the current
techniques, methods and existing physical models used to process the LLR data.
We also identify the challenges for modeling and data analysis that the LLR
community faces today in order to take full advantage of the new APOLLO ranging
station.

retarded-time coordinate labels forward light cones that are centered on the
world line, the radial coordinate is an affine parameter on the null generators
of these light cones, and the angular coordinates are constant on each of these
generators. The spacetime metric in the retarded coordinates is displayed as an
expansion in powers of the radial coordinate and expressed in terms of the
world line's acceleration vector and the spacetime's Riemann tensor evaluated
at the world line. The formalism is illustrated in two examples, the first
involving a comoving world line of a spatially-flat cosmology, the other
featuring an observer in circular motion in the Schwarzschild spacetime. The
main application of the formalism is presented in the second part of the
article, in which I consider the motion of a small black hole in an empty
external universe. I use the retarded coordinates to construct the metric of
the small black hole perturbed by the tidal field of the external universe, and
the metric of the external universe perturbed by the presence of the black
hole. Matching these metrics produces the MiSaTaQuWa equations of motion for
the small black hole.

in the Higgs phase of the Georgi-Glashow model is generalized to study the

yields Casimir scaling in the weakly-coupled 3-d SU(N) Georgi-Glashow model.
Corrections to the Casimir formula are considered. When k is of the order of N,
the non-diluteness effect is of the same order as the leading term, indicating
that non-diluteness can significantly change the Casimir-scaling behavior. The
correction produced by the propagating Higgs field is also studied and found to
increase, together with the non-diluteness effect, the Casimir-scaling ratio.
Furthermore, a correction due to closed k-strings is also computed and is shown
to yield the same k-dependence as the one due to non-diluteness, but with the
opposite sign and a nontrivial N-dependence. Finally, we consider the possible
implications of our analysis for the SU(N) analogue of compact QED in four

Contributions of the Breit interaction between different core and valence
shells are studied in the Dirac-Fock approximation for the uranium, plutonium,
ekathallium (Z=113), ekalead (Z=114) and other heavy atoms. It is shown that
the two-electron Breit effects between the valence electrons can be neglected
for ""chemical accuracy"" (1 kcal/mol) of calculation of spectroscopic properties
of systems containing superheavy elements and actinides whereas large core-core
and core-valence Breit contributions can be efficiently described by
one-electron RECP operators. Different versions of the generalized RECPs with
the Breit interaction taken into account are constructed for uranium and
plutonium and tested in comparison with the corresponding all-electron
four-component calculations.

Interferometer. Since the development of the causal interpretation of
relativistic boson fields there have not been any applications for which the
equations of motion for the field have been solved explicitly. Here, we provide
perhaps the first application of the causal interpretation of boson fields for
which the equations of motion are solved. Specifically, we consider the
electromagnetic field. Solving the equations of motion allows us to develop a
relativistic causal model of the Wheeler delayed-choice Mach-Zehnder
Interferometer. We show explicitly that a photon splits at a beam splitter. We
also demonstrate the inherent nonlocal nature of a relativistic quantum field.
This is particularly revealed in a which-path measurement where a quantum is
nonlocally absorbed from both arms of the interferometer. This feature explains
how when a photon is split by a beam splitter it nevertheless registers on a
detector in one arm of the interferometer. Bohm et al \cite{BDH85} have argued
that a causal model of a Wheeler delayed-choice experiment avoids the paradox
of creating or changing history, but they did not provide the details of such a
model. The relativistic causal model we develop here serves as a detailed
example which demonstrates this point, though our model is in terms of a field
picture rather than the particle picture of the Bohm-de Broglie nonrelativistic
causal interpretation.

  Hoyer, Mosca and Tapp, which approximates the arithmetic mean of a Boolean
function defined on $N$ elements. We present sharp error bounds of the QS
algorithm in the worst-average setting with the average performance measured in
the $L_q$ norm, $q \in [1,\infty]$. We prove that the QS algorithm with $M$
quantum queries, $M<N$, has the worst-average error bounds of the form
$\Theta(\ln M/M)$ for $q=1$, $\Theta(M^{-1/q})$ for $q\in (1,\infty)$, and is
equal to 1 for $q=\infty$. We also discuss the asymptotic constants of these
estimates. We improve the error bounds by using the QS algorithm with
repetitions. Using the number of repetitions which is independent of $M$ and
linearly dependent on $q$, we get the error bound of order $M^{-1}$ for any $q
\in [1,\infty)$. Since $\Omega(M^{-1})$ is a lower bound on the worst-average
error of any quantum algorithm with $M$ queries, the QS algorithm with
repetitions is optimal in the worst-average setting.

simplified analysis of its query complexity. We present several applications,

graph. One of these algorithms uses O(N^(2L/(L+1))) edge queries, and the other
uses \tilde{O}(N^((5L-2)/(2L+4))), which is an improvement for L <= 5. The
latter algorithm generalizes a recent result of Magniez, Santha, and Szegedy,

Wolfram, have argued that quantum mechanics will break down before the
factoring of large numbers becomes possible. If this is true, then there should
be a natural set of quantum states that can account for all experiments
performed to date, but not for Shor's factoring algorithm. We investigate as a
candidate the set of states expressible by a polynomial number of additions and
tensor products. Using a recent lower bound on multilinear formula size due to
Raz, we then show that states arising in quantum error-correction require
n^{Omega(log n)} additions and tensor products even to approximate, which
incidentally yields the first superpolynomial gap between general and
multilinear formula size of functions. More broadly, we introduce a complexity
classification of pure quantum states, and prove many basic facts about this
classification. Our goal is to refine vague ideas about a breakdown of quantum
mechanics into specific hypotheses that might be experimentally testable in the
near future.

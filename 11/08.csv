dormant galaxies, those containing an appreciable ISM but no star formation,
are at best rare. We have made first pass morphological surveys for starbursts,
as judged by H-alpha surface brightness, and outflows as judged by extra-planar
H-alpha. We find that about 15% of the sources contain starbursts, with little

edge-on galaxies show evidence for extra-planar H-alpha having a scale size of

flatter than the galaxy light. Using the luminosity function we derive a
distance modulus of $\mu=31.61\pm0.2$, which within the uncertainty agrees with
the distance from surface brightness fluctuations. Blue and red clusters show
similar radial concentrations and azimuthal distributions. The total number of

specific frequency of $S_{N}=1.6\pm0.3$. This value is surprisingly low for a
giant elliptical, but resembles the case of merger remnants like NGC1316, where
the low specific frequency is probably caused by the luminosity contribution of
an intermediate-age population. A further common property is the high rate of

of the main cluster. The star-formation rate of a galaxy may gradually decrease
by the stripping of warm gas (`strangulation') in a main cluster. However, we
find that ram-pressure stripping could start before the strangulation is
completed, if a field galaxy directly falls into the main cluster. Since this
conflicts with some recent observations, many galaxies might have been affected
by some environmental effects when they were in subclusters before they fell
into the main cluster (`pre-processing'). We show that strangulation and
evaporation of the cold gas by the surrounding hot ICM in subclusters are the
possible candidates. We also show that the observed morphological

consisting of local fermion pairs. Furthermore, the experiments have shown that
the resulting diatomic molecules can have surprisingly long lifetimes. Here we
report the conversion of a Fermi sea of atoms into a molecular BEC. In addition
to being the first molecular condensate in thermal equilibrium, this BEC
represents one extreme of the predicted BCS-BEC continuum.

the information growth through the scale refinement. Due to the incompleteness

normalization $\sum_ip_i^q=1$ is applied throughout the paper, where $q$ is the
fractal dimension divided by the dimension of the smooth Euclidean space in
which the fractal structure of the phase space is embedded. It is shown that
the information growth is nonadditive and is proportional to the trace-form
$\sum_ip_i-\sum_ip_i^q$ which can be connected to several nonadditive
entropies. This information growth can be extremized to give power law
distributions for these non-equilibrium systems. It can also be used for the
study of the thermodynamics derived from Tsallis entropy for nonadditive
systems which contain subsystems each having its own $q$. It is argued that,
within this thermodynamics, the Stefan-Boltzmann law of blackbody radiation can
be preserved.

effect of scattering from fermion impurities ($^3$He atoms). Thus, a
non-Markovian equation of motion for the mean value of the vortex position
operator is derived within a weak-coupling approximation. Such an equation is
shown to yield, in the Markovian and elastic scattering limits, a $^3$He
contribution to the longitudinal friction coefficient equivalent to that
arising from the Rayfield-Reif formula. Simultaneous Markov and elastic
scattering limits are found, however, to be incompatible, since an unexpected
breakdown of the Markovian approximation is detected at low cyclotron
frequencies. Then, a non-Markovian expression for the longitudinal friction
coefficient is derived and computed as a function of temperature and $^3$He
concentration. Such calculations show that cyclotron frequencies within the
range 0.01$-$0.03 ps$^{-1}$ yield a very good agreement to the longitudinal
friction figures computed from the Iordanskii and Rayfield-Reif formulas for
pure $^4$He, up to temperatures near 1 K. A similar performance is found for
nonvanishing $^3$He concentrations, where the comparison is also shown to be
very favorable with respect to the available experimental data. Memory effects

ensembles, AMM transforms original $2N$-dimensional {\it stochastic} delay
differential equations (SDDEs) to infinite-dimensional {\it deterministic} DEs
for means and correlation functions of local and global variables.
Infinite-order recursive DEs are terminated at the finite level $m$ in the
level-$m$ AMM (AMM$m$), yielding $8(m+1)$-dimensional deterministic DEs. When a
single spike is applied, the oscillation may be induced if parameters of
coupling strength, delay, noise intensity and/or ensemble size are appropriate.
Effects of these parameters on the emergence of the oscillation and on the
synchronization in FN neuron ensembles have been studied. The synchronization
shows the {\it fluctuation-induced} enhancement at the transition between
non-oscillating and oscillating states. Results calculated by AMM5 are in
fairly good agreement with those obtained by direct simulations.

and of the bundle (/\x/)(R^3) for an octet. We find doubler-free lattice Dirac
operators for above bundles. A gauge-invariant connection with Wilson lattice
gauge fields is possible for some real representations of the gauge group. The
QCD action of SU(3) is of this type.
  Application in lattice QCD seems useful: We don't have to waste time and
memory for doublers as well as for correction terms to suppress them.

effect of the threshold resummation on heavy quark production in
charged-current DIS.
  To predict the spectrum of b-flavored hadrons in top decay, we calculate at
NLO the QCD corrections for bottom production in top decay with the b-mass
fully taken into account. Using the perturbative fragmentation function
formalism we then resum with NLL accuracy large collinear logs of the ratio of
bottom-to-top mass, which leads to an essential improvement of the result. Next
we perform the threshold resummation for the coefficient function for top decay
with NLL accuracy. That resummation leads to an important improvement of the
b-spectrum in the large energy fraction region. Finally, we extract information
for the non-perturbative b-fragmentation into hadrons from e^+e^- data and make
a prediction for the spectrum of those b-flavored hadrons produced in top-quark
decay. Our second application is to charm production in charged-current DIS. We
first calculate with NLL accuracy the soft-gluon resummed coefficient function
for heavy quark production (initiated by a light quark) in DIS. Our result is
applicable for the case of low momentum transfer that is of the order of the
mass of the heavy quark. We also make a connection of this result to the known
result for massless quark production. We then apply this result for charm quark
production at NuTeV and HERA for a wide range of the transferred momentum, and
present the effect of the resummation on the charm structure functions.

  Artin-Schreier Extensions","10 pages",,,,"math.NT",,"  In this paper, we study the discrete logarithm problem in the finite fields
$\F_{q^n}$ where $n|q-1$. The field is called a Kummer field or a Kummer
extension of $\F_q$. It plays an important role in improving the AKS primality
proving algorithm. It is known that we can efficiently construct an element $g$
with order greater than $2^n$ in the fields. Let $S_q(\bullet)$ be the function
from integers to the sum of digits in their $q$-ary expansions. We present an
algorithm that given $g^e$ ($ 0\leq e < q^n $) finds $e$ in random polynomial
time, provided that $S_q (e) < n$. We then show that the problem is solvable in
random polynomial time for most of the exponent $e$ with $S_q (e) < 1.32 n $.
The main tool for the latter result is the Guruswami-Sudan list decoding
algorithm. Built on these results, we prove that in the field $\F_{q^{q-1}}$,
the bounded sum-of-digits discrete logarithm with respect to $g$ can be
computed in random time $O(f(w) \log^4 (q^{q-1}))$, where $f$ is a
subexponential function and $w$ is the bound on the $q$-ary sum-of-digits of
the exponent. Hence the problem is fixed parameter tractable. These results are
shown to be extendible to Artin-Schreier extension $\F_{p^p}$ where $p$ is a
prime. Since every finite field has an extension of reasonable degree which is
a Kummer field, our result reveals an unexpected property of the discrete
logarithm problem, namely, the bounded sum-of-digits discrete logarithm problem
in any given finite field becomes polynomial time solvable in certain low
degree extensions.

1-1/k on the k-ary tree. A related result is that in any rooted tree T, there

understand the topological change that can propagate Alzheimer and
Creutzfeld-Jakobs diseases, among others. The computational community has paid
considerable attention to this problem; however, the associated time scale,
typically on the order of milliseconds or more, represents a formidable
challenge. Ab initio protein folding from long molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations or ensemble dynamics is not feasible with ordinary computing
facilities and new techniques must be introduced. Here we present a detailed
study of the folding of a 16-residue beta-hairpin, described by a generic
energy model and using the activation-relaxation technique. From a total of 90
trajectories at 300 K, three folding pathways emerge. All involve a
simultaneous optimization of the complete hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding
interactions. The first two follow closely those observed by previous
theoretical studies. The third pathway, never observed by previous all-atom
folding, unfolding and equilibrium simulations, can be described as a reptation
move of one strand of the beta-sheet with respect to the other. This reptation
move indicates that non-native interactions can play a dominant role in the
folding of secondary structures. These results point to a more complex folding
picture than expected for a simple beta-hairpin.

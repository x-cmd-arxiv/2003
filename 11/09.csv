(MEFOS) at the 3.6-m telescope of ESO. The observations are part of a redshift
survey of partially obscured galaxies recorded in the course of a deep optical
galaxy search behind the southern Milky Way. A total of 947 galaxies have been
observed, a small percentage of the spectra (N=109, 11.5%) were contaminated by
foreground stars, and 74 galaxies (7.8%) were too faint to allow a reliable
redshift determination. With MEFOS we obtained spectra down to the faintest
galaxies of our optical galaxy survey, and hence probe large-scale structures
out to larger distances (v <~ 30000 km/s) than our other redshift follow-ups.
The most distinct large-scale structures revealed in the southern Zone of
Avoidance are discussed in context to known structures adjacent to the Milky
Way.

  Tokyo, July 2003",,,"IFUP-TH/2003/44","hep-th hep-lat",,"  Much about the confinement and dynamical symmetry breaking in QCD might be
learned from models with supersymmetry. In particular, models based on N=2
supersymmetric theories with gauge groups SU(N), SO(N) and $USp(2 N)$ and with
various number of flavors, give deep dynamical hints about these phenomena. For
instance, the BPS non-abelian monopoles can become the dominant degrees of
freedom in the infrared due to quantum effects. Upon condensation (which can be
triggered in these class of models by perturbing them with an adjoint scalar
mass) they induce confinement with calculable pattern of dynamical symmetry
breaking. This may occur either in a weakly interacting regime or in a strongly
coupled regime (in the latter, often the low-energy degrees of freedom contain
relatively non-local monopoles and dyons simultaneously and the system is near
a nontrivial fixed-point).
  Also, the existence of sytems with BPS {\it non-abelian vortices} has been
shown recently. These results point toward the idea that the ground state of
QCD is a sort of dual superconductor of non-abelian variety.

coordinates of a point in the variety, and the sum-product algorithm is an
efficient tool for evaluating specific coordinates. The question addressed here
is how the solutions to various inference problems depend on the model
parameters. The proposed answer is expressed in terms of tropical algebraic
geometry. A key role is played by the Newton polytope of a statistical model.
Our results are applied to the hidden Markov model and to the general Markov
model on a binary tree.

to the one obtained in a microcavity, and this scheme allows one to predict
significant cavity QED effects.

In v3 some corrections and precisions",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We consider the situation where a two-level atom is placed in the vicinity of
the center of a spherical cavity with a large numerical aperture. The vacuum
field at the center of the cavity is actually equivalent to the one obtained in
a microcavity, and both the dissipative and the reactive parts of the atom's
spontaneous emission are significantly modified. Using an explicit calculation
of the spatial dependence of the radiative relaxation rate and of the
associated level shift, we show that for a weakly excitating light field, the
atom can be attracted to the center of the cavity by vacuum-induced light
shifts.

thermodynamics, we review from its vantage point topics such as the information
conundrum that emerges from the ability of incipient black holes to radiate,
the various entropy bounds for non-black hole systems (holographic bound,
universal entropy bound, etc) which are most easily derived from black hole
thermodynamics, Bousso's covariant entropy bound, the holographic principle of
particle physics, and the subject of channel capacity of quantum communication
channels.

Quantum limits on communication and information storage leading to these
conclusions are here described. Quantum channel capacity theory is reviewed for
both steady state and burst communication. An analytic approximation is given
for the maximum signal information possible with occupation number signal
states as a function of mean signal energy. A theorem guaranteeing that these
states are optimal for communication is proved. A heuristic ""proof"" of the
linear bound on communication is given, followed by rigorous proofs for signals
with specified mean energy, and for signals with given energy budget. And
systems of many parallel quantum channels are shown to obey the linear bound
for a natural channel architecture. The time--energy uncertainty principle is
reformulated in information language by means of the linear bound. The quantum
bound on information storage capacity of quantum mechanical and quantum field
devices is reviewed. A simplified version of the analytic proof for the bound
is given for the latter case. Solitons as information caches are discussed, as
is information storage in one dimensional systems. The influence of signal
self--gravitation on communication is considerd. Finally, it is shown that
acceleration of a receiver acts to block information transfer.

Journal of Quantum Information 1, 465 (2003)",,,"quant-ph",,"  This article reviews and extends recent results concerning entanglement and
frustration in multipartite systems which have some symmetry with respect to
the ordering of the particles. Starting point of the discussion are Bell
inequalities: their relation to frustration in classical systems and their
satisfaction for quantum states which have a symmetric extension. It is then
discussed how more general global symmetries of multipartite systems constrain
the entanglement between two neighboring particles. We prove that maximal
entanglement (measured in terms of the entanglement of formation) is always
attained for the ground state of a certain nearest neighbor interaction
Hamiltonian having the considered symmetry with the achievable amount of
entanglement being a function of the ground state energy. Systems of Gaussian
states, i.e. quantum harmonic oscillators, are investigated in more detail and
the results are compared to what is known about ordered qubit systems.

states into a quantum memory (QM). We observe that in some general cases the
quantum state can be retrieved up to a unitary transformation depicted by the
non-Abelian Berry's geometric phase factor (holonomy). The QIS of photon with
this geometric character can be implemented with the symmetric collective
excitations of a $\Lambda$-atom ensemble, which is adiabatically controlled by
a classical light with a small detuning $\delta$. The cyclic change of the
controlled Rabi frequency $\Omega(t)$ with period $T=\frac{2n\pi}{\delta}$
accumulates additional geometric phases in different components of the final
photon state. Then, in a purely geometric way the stored state can be decoded
from the final state.

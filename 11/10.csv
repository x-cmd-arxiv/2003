transient sigmoidal (forward or reverse S-shaped) structures that brighten in
soft X rays prior to coronal eruptions. The upward-kinked loop has the opposite

older stellar population is distributed roughly following the outer contours of
the neutral hydrogen in the tidal tail; we associate these stars with material
ejected from the outer disks of the two spirals. The older stellar population
has a red giant branch tip at I=26.5+/-0.2 from which we derive a distance
modulus (m-M)_0=30.7+/-0.25. The implied distance of 13.8+/-1.7 Mpc is
significantly smaller than commonly quoted distances for NGC 4038/9. In

clusters. One might conclude that SSCs require the higher pressures found in
the central regions in order to form, while spontaneous star formation in the
tail produces the kind of O-B star associations seen in dwarf irregular
galaxies. The youngest population in the putative tidal dwarf has a total
stellar mass of ~2x10^5 Msun, while the old population has a stellar mass of
\~7x10^7 Msun. If our smaller distance modulus is correct, it has far-reaching
consequences for this proto-typical merger. Specifically, the luminous to

connects this distribution to the infall pattern of satellites along the

the peak of the SED is not well constrained, most of the energy is emitted in
the 10-100 eV regime, constituting roughly half of the emitted energy in the
optical/X-ray ranges. This is consistent with a primary spectral component
peaking in the extreme UV/soft X-ray band, and disk-corona models, hence high
accretion rates. Indeed, we estimate that \dot{m}~1. We examine the emission
lines in its spectrum, and we constrain the physical properties of the
line-emitting gas through photoionization modeling. The line-emitting gas is
characterized by log n~11 and log U~0, and is stratified around log U~0. Our
estimate of the radius of the H\beta-emitting region ~10 \pm 2 lt-days is
consistent with the radius-luminosity relationships found for Sy1 galaxies. We

The observed flux probability distribution and flux power spectrum limit the
volume filling factor of bubbles to be less than 10%. We have compared the mean
flux as a function of distance from haloes with the Adelberger etal (ASSP)
measurement. A model with bubbles of constant radius of 1.5Mpc/h surrounding
the most massive haloes matches the high transmissivity at separations
<0.5Mpc/h, but the increase of the transmissivity at small scales is more
gradual than observed. At separations <0.5Mpc/h, our estimate of the cosmic
variance error is $\Delta F\sim 0.3$, 30% higher than that of ASSP. The
difficulty in matching the rise in the transmissivity at small separations is
caused by residual absorption of neutral hydrogen lying physically outside the
bubbles but having a redshift position similar to the haloes. The flux level is
thus sensitive to the amplitude of the coherent velocity shear near haloes
which increases with halo mass in the simulation. A model where LBGs are
starbursts in small mass haloes matches the observations with smaller bubble
size than one where more massive haloes host the LBGs. A starburst model with a
bubble radius of 1Mpc/h and a volume filling factor of 2% is consistent with
the ASSP measurements at the 1-1.5$\sigma$ level. If this model is correct the
sharp rise of the transmissivity at small separation in the ASSP sample is due
to cosmic variance and is expected to become more moderate for a larger sample.

expansion. In particular, the precision of the positions of the Doppler peaks

cosmology. The available parameter space is further constrained by various high
redshift supernova datasets taken from Tonry et al. (2003), a sample of 230

extinction have been recomputed where possible and a consistent zero-point has

bulge effective scalelength and luminosity increase with increasing n, but disk
properties are independent of bulge shape. As Hubble type T increases, bulges
become less luminous and their mean effective surface brightness gets fainter;
disks shows a similar, but much weaker, trend. When bulge parameters are
compared with disk ones, they are tightly correlated for n=1 bulges. The
correlations gradually worsen with increasing n such that n=4 bulges appear
virtually independent of their disks. The Kormendy relation, surf. brightness
vs. effect. radius, is shown to depend on bulge shape; the two parameters are
tightly correlated in n=4 bulges, and increasingly less so as n decreases;
disks are well correlated .Bulge-to-disk size ratios are independent of Hubble
type, but smaller for exponential bulges. Strongly barred SB galaxies with
exponential bulges are more luminous than their unbarred counterparts.
Exponential bulges appear to be closely related to their underlying disks,

show a significant population of hot stars fainter than the zero-age horizontal
branch (``blue hook'' stars), which cannot be explained by canonical stellar
evolution. Their results suggest that stars which experience unusually large
mass loss on the red giant branch and which subsequently undergo the helium
core flash while descending the white dwarf cooling curve could populate this
region. Theory predicts that these ``late hot flashers'' should show higher
temperatures than the hottest canonical horizontal branch (HB) stars and should
have He- and C-rich atmospheres. As a test of this late hot flasher scenario,
we have obtained and analysed medium resolution spectra of a sample of blue
hook stars in NGC2808 to derive their atmospheric parameters. Using the same
procedures, we have also re-analyzed our earlier spectra of the blue hook stars
in omega Cen (Moehler et al. 2002) for comparison with the present results for
NGC2808. The blue hook stars in these two clusters are both hotter (Teff >
35,000 K) and more helium-rich than canonical extreme HB stars in agreement
with the late hot flasher scenario. Moreover, we find indications for C
enhancement in the three most He-enriched stars in NGC2808. However, the blue
hook stars still show some H in their atmospheres, perhaps indicating that some
residual H survives a late hot flash and then later diffuses to the surface
during the HB phase. We note that the presence of blue hook stars apparently
depends mostly on the total mass of the globular cluster and not so much on its
HB morphology.

control their car by a simple scheme. The acceleration $a(t)$ is held
approximately constant for a certain time interval, followed by a jump to a new
acceleration. These jumps seem to include a deterministic and a random
component; the time $T$ between subsequent jumps is random, too. This leads to
a dynamic, that never reaches a fixed-point ($a(t) \to 0$ and velocity
difference to the car in front $\Delta v \to 0$) of the car-following dynamics.
The existence of such a fixed-point is predicted by most of the existing
car-following theories. Nevertheless, the phase-space distribution is clustered
strongly at $\Delta v=0$. Here, the probability distribution in $\Delta v$ is
(for small and medium distances $\Delta x$ between the cars) described by
$p(\Delta v) \propto \exp(-|\Delta v|/\Delta v_0)$ indicating a dynamic that
attracts cars to the region with small speed differences. The corresponding
distances $\Delta x$ between the cars vary strongly. This variation might be a
possible reason for the much-discussed widely scattered states found in highway

framework for treating the uncertainties due to the higher orders. As an

the corresponding flatness of the inflaton potential are preserved in the

associated gravitational lens phenomena, require the use of the theory of
General Relativity. I consider here a classical approach, based on Newton's
equation of motion for massive particles. These particles are emitted by a
distant source and deflected by the gravitational field of a (opaque) star or
of a (transparent) galaxy. The dependence of the deviation angle $D$ on the
impact parameter $b$, and the geometry of the (source, deflector, earth)
triplet, imply that different particle trajectories may reach an earth based
observer. Since $D(b)$ does not depend on the mass of the particles, it is
tempting to set the particles' velocity equal to the speed of light to get a
(Newtonian) flavor of gravitational lenses phenomena. Orders of magnitude are
obtained through a non technical approach and can be compared to the General
Relativity results.

the excitation scheme, which could lead to a suppression of inelastic
collisions, and find that this mechanism is not present in our simulation
results due to the multistate character of the excitation process.

each other. Several studies based on entropy calculation correlating
experimental measurement of residue participation in folding nucleus and
sequence conservation have reached different conclusions. Here we report
analysis of conservation of folding nucleus using an evolutionary model
alternative to entropy based approaches. We employ a continuous time Markov
model of codon substitution to distinguish mutation fixed by evolution and
mutation fixed by chance. This model takes into account bias in codon
frequency, bias favoring transition over transversion, as well as explicit
phylogenetic information. We measure selection pressure using the ratio
$\omega$ of synonymous vs. non-synonymous substitution at individual residue
site. The $\omega$-values are estimated using the {\sc Paml} method, a
maximum-likelihood estimator. Our results show that there is little correlation
between the extent of kinetic participation in protein folding nucleus as
measured by experimental $\phi$-value and selection pressure as measured by
$\omega$-value. In addition, two randomization tests failed to show that
folding nucleus residues are significantly more conserved than the whole
protein. These results suggest that at the level of codon substitution, there
is no indication that folding nucleus residues are significantly more conserved
than other residues. We further reconstruct candidate ancestral residues of the
folding nucleus and suggest possible test tube mutation studies of ancient
folding nucleus.

this chapter, we briefly review the dynamical aspects of models of regulatory
networks, discussing their most salient features, and we also show how these
models can give clues about the way in which networks may organize their
capacity to evolve, by providing simple examples of the implementation of
robustness and modularity.

boundary is known to have happened over a (geologically) short period of time.
It involved the rapid diversification of body plans and stands as one of the
major transitions in evolution. How it took place is a controversial issue.
Here we explore this problem by considering a simple model of pattern formation
in multicellular organisms. By modeling gene network-based morphogenesis and
its evolution through adaptive walks, we explore the question of how
combinatorial explosions might have been actually involved in the Cambrian
event. Here we show that a small amount of genetic complexity including both
gene regulation and cell-cell signaling allows one to generate an extraordinary
repertoire of stable spatial patterns of gene expression compatible with
observed anteroposterior patterns in early development of metazoans. The
consequences for the understanding of the tempo and mode of the Cambrian event
are outlined.

generates an associative product of functions on the phase space. This product
is given by an integral kernel whose phase is the symplectic area of a
groupoid-consistent membrane. A symplectic phase space connection with
non-trivial curvature is extracted from the magnetic reflections associated
with the Stratonovich quantizer. Zero and constant curvature cases are
considered as examples. The quantization with both static and time dependent
electromagnetic fields is obtained. The expansion of the product by the

performs a Bell-basis measurement to draw Alice's information. The security of
this protocol is based on `High fidelity implies low entropy'. If Eve want to
eavesdrop Alice's information, she has to attack both qubits of the EPR pair,

a mixed state which is no longer a minimum uncertainty state. We establish an

fidelity for the input state is 0.85$\pm$ 0.05 which is higher than the
classical case of 0.73$\pm$0.04. We also verify that the teleportation process
operates properly for the nonclassical state input and its squeezed variance is
certainly transferred through the process. We observe the smaller variance of
the teleported squeezed state than that for the vacuum state input.

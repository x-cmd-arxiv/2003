in the frame of the decaying isotope, is determined by its kinematics when it
decays, typically 10^6 y after its ejection into the interstellar medium from
its nucleosynthesis source. Three measurements of the line width exist:
HEAO-C's 1982 value of (0+3) keV FWHM, the GRIS 1996 value of (5.4 +/- 1.3) keV
FWHM, and the recent RHESSI value of (2.0 +/- 0.8) keV FWHM, suggesting either
""cold"", ""hot"", or ""warm"" 26Al in the ISM. We model the line width as expected
from Galactic rotation, expanding supernova ejecta, and/or Wolf-Rayet winds,
and predict a value below 1 keV (FWHM) with plausible assumptions about 26Al
initial velocities and expansion history. Even though the recent RHESSI
measurement reduces the need to explain a broad line corresponding to 540 km/s
mean 26Al velocity through extreme assumptions about grain transport of 26Al or
huge interstellar cavities, our results suggest that standard 26Al ejection
models produce a line on the narrow side of what is observed by RHESSI and
INTEGRAL. Improved INTEGRAL and RHESSI spatially-resolved line width
measurements should help to disentangle the effects of Galactic rotation from
the ISM trajectories of 26Al.

with low rotation (the initial ratio of thermal to gravitational energy is

energy is $\beta_0 = 0.02 {\rm to} 0.05$). They are then subjected to a steady
increase in external pressure. Fragmentation is promoted -- in the sense that
more protostars are formed -- both by more rapid compression, and by higher
rotation (larger $\beta_0$). In general, the large-scale collapse is
non-homologous, and follows the pattern described in Paper I for non-rotating
clouds, viz. a compression wave is driven into the cloud, thereby increasing
the density and the inflow velocity. The effects of rotation become important
at the centre, where the material with low angular momentum forms a central
primary protostar (CPP), whilst the material with higher angular momentum forms
an accretion disc around the CPP. More rapid compression drives a stronger
compression wave and delivers material more rapidly into the outer parts of the

a 2-10 keV PSD covering an unprecedent frequency range of over 6.5 decades from
<10^-8 to >10^-2 Hz. This PSD is a very good match to the PSD of the galactic
black hole binary system (GBH) Cyg X-1 when in a `high', rather than `low',
state providing the first definite confirmation of an AGN in a `high' state. A
bending, rather than sharply broken, powerlaw is a better description of the
PSDs of Cyg X-1 in the high state and of NGC4051. At low frequencies the PSD of
NGC4051 has a slope of -1.1 bending, at nu_B = 8 x 10^-4 Hz, to a slope of
alpha_H ~ -2 (steeper at lower energies). If nu_B scales with mass, we imply a
black hole mass of 3 x 10^5 Msolar in NGC4051, consistent with the 5 x 10^5
Msolar reverberation value. Hence NGC4051 is emitting at ~30% L_Edd.
  NGC4051 follows the same rms-flux relationship as GBHs. Phase lags and
coherence between bands are also the same as in GBHs. The lag of soft by hard
photons increases, and coherence decreases, as band separation increases. The
lag, and coherence, are greater for variations of longer Fourier period. This
behaviour suggests that higher photon energies and shorter variability
timescales are associated with smaller radii. Using also data from the
literature, we cannot fit all AGN to the same linear scaling of break timescale
with black hole mass. However broad line AGN are consistent with a linear
scaling from Cyg X-1 in its low state and NLS1 galaxies scale better with Cyg
X-1 in its high state. We suggest that the relationship between black hole mass
and break timescale is a function of at least one other underlying parameter,
which may be accretion rate or black hole spin.

condensation of giant molecular clouds is the limiting step to star formation
within the M33 disk. The corresponding molecular Schmidt index, n_{mol}, is
1.36 +/- 0.08. The star formation rate has a steep dependence on total mass gas
surface density, (Sigma_{HI}+Sigma_{H_2}), owing to the shallow radial profile
of the atomic gas which dominates the total gas surface density for most radii.

that we have an all or nothing situation for radiation-driving: radiation
driving has to be responsible for both launching and accelerating the wind or a

of 2.308-2.317 microns and 1.553-1.559 microns were observed at a spectral

associated with the pulsar wind termination shock, a jet that may be aligned
with the rotation axis, and other regions of enhanced emission. Spectral
variations in the PWN are consistent with the expected evolution of the
postshock flow, and complex loops of emission are seen in the nebula interior.
Limits on the NS surface temperature fall below standard cooling models,
indicating that some more rapid neutrino cooling process is required. The outer

the continuum shapes at z~0.1 and z>3 similar, consistent with no significant

the Eddington rate and M is the black hole mass. This study expands our earlier
high redshift sample to lower luminosity, away from extreme objects and towards
a luminosity overlap with lower redshift samples. The distribution of
rest-frame optical/UV continuum shapes for this fainter sample is broader,
extending further to the red than that of the brighter z>3 one. Three quasars
from this fainter sample, two radio-selected and one optically-selected, have
optical continuum slopes alpha<-1 (F_{nu}~nu^{alpha}). The optically-selected
one, LBQS0056+0125, appears to be reddened by dust along the line of sight or

TXS2358+189, could derive their red continua from the contribution of a
relatively strong synchrotron component to the rest-frame optical. These

relatively young stellar population with an age of approximately 2 Gyr, though
the current data do not rule out the presence of older stars. Our preferred
interpretation is that the overdensity represents shell structure in the Fornax
dSph galaxy, a phenomenon previously unseen in dwarf galaxies. The shell may be
the remnant of a merger with Fornax of a smaller, gas-rich system that occured
approximately 2 Gyr ago. The comparitively recent star formation seen in some
dSph and dE galaxies may then also be the result of infall of small relatively
gas-rich systems.

sputtering and collisions which are extremely difficult to study

velocity: vaporization, fragmentation, atomic implantation, sticking, elastic
recoil, atomic chemisorption, H abstraction and H2 formation, etc. The
impact-velocity threshold is about 10 km/s but complete grain destruction
requires much higher velocities and nearly equal grain sizes. The main outcome
of strong collisions is vaporization, i.e. formation of small molecules rather
than solid fragments; most of the impact energy is carried away by these
molecules in the form of kinetic energy. As a consequence, the energy left in
the bulk is insufficient for shattering or even thermal processing. Grain size
distribution is hardly affected by such collisions. These results cast doubt on
the notion that collisions reduce grain lifetime so much as to require
efficient growth processes in the interstellar medium.

equations for spin-polarized electrons in a III-V semiconductor single quantum
well. Electron spin dynamics is controlled by the linear in momentum spin-orbit
interaction. In a studied transport regime an electron momentum scattering rate
is appreciably faster than spin dynamics. A set of transport equations is
defined in terms of a particle density, spin density, and respective fluxes.
The developed model allows studying of coherent dynamics of a non-equilibrium
spin polarization. As an example, we consider a stationary transport regime for
a heterostructure grown along the (0, 0, 1) crystallographic direction. Due to
the interplay of the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit terms spin dynamics
strongly depends on a transport direction. The model is consistent with results
of pulse-probe measurement of spin coherence in strained semiconductor layers.
It can be useful for studying properties of spin-polarized transport and
modeling of spintronic devices operating in the diffusive transport regime.

We show via Monte Carlo simulations that the sigma model can be disordered
while effectively forbidding these point topological defects. The resulting
paramagnetic state has gauge charged matter with half-integer spin (spinons)
and also an emergent gauge field (photons), whose existence is explicitly
demonstrated. Hence, this is an explicit realization of fractionalization in a
model with global SU(2) symmetry. The zero temperature ordering transition from
this phase is found to be continuous but distinct from the regular Heisenberg
ordering transition. We propose that these phases and this phase transition are
captured by the {\it noncompact} $CP^1$ model, which contains a pair of bosonic
fields coupled to a noncompact U(1) gauge field. Direct simulation of the
transition in this model yields critical exponents that support this claim. The
easy-plane limit of this model also displays a continuous zero temperature
ordering transition, which has the remarkable property of being self-dual. The
presence of emergent gauge charge and hence Coulomb interactions is evidenced
by the presence of a finite temperature Kosterlitz-Thouless transition
associated with the thermal ionization of the gauge charged spinons.
Generalization to higher dimensions and the effects of nonzero hedgehog
fugacity are discussed.

properties in identifying the relevant running variables describing the

due to the Ward identities, which implement the conservation laws associated
with the various symmetries, help to minimize the number of independent running
variables. This use of the Ward identities is examined both in the case of a
stable phase and of a critical phenomenon. In the first case we consider the
problems of interacting fermions and bosons. In one dimension general and
specific Ward identities are sufficient to show the non-Fermi-liquid character
of the interacting fermion system, and also allow to describe the crossover to
a Fermi liquid above one dimension. This crossover is examined both in the
absence and presence of singular interaction. On the other hand, in the case of
interacting bosons in the superfluid phase, the implementation of the Ward
identities provides the asymptotically exact description of the acoustic
low-energy excitation spectrum, and clarifies the subtle mechanism of how this
is realized below and above three dimensions. As a critical phenomenon, we
discuss the disorder-driven metal-insulator transition in a disordered
interacting Fermi system. In this case, through the use of Ward identities, one
is able to associate all the disorder effects to renormalizations of the Landau
parameters. As a consequence, the occurrence of a metal-insulator transition is
described as a critical breakdown of a Fermi liquid.

all Riemannian 3-metrics modulo diffeomorphisms. However, it has been argued
that the configuration space for gravity should be conformal superspace - the
space of all Riemannian 3-metrics modulo diffeomorphisms and conformal
transformations. Taking this conformal nature seriously leads to a new theory
of gravity which although very similar to general relativity has some very
different features particularly in cosmology and quantisation. It should
reproduce the standard tests of general relativity. The cosmology is studied in
some detail. The theory is incredibly restrictive and as a result admits an
extremely limited number of possible solutions. The problems of the standard
cosmology are addressed and most remarkably the cosmological constant problem
is resolved in a natural way. The theory also has several attractive features
with regard to quantisation particularly regarding the problem of time.

absence of electromagnetic currents, the trace of the Chevreton superenergy
tensor, $H_{ab}$ is divergence-free in four-dimensional (a) Einstein spacetimes

pointed out, in analogy with flat spaces, that for Einstein spacetimes the
trace of the Chevreton superenergy tensor $H_{ab}$ can be rearranged in the
form of a generalised wave operator $\square_L$ acting on the energy momentum
tensor $T_{ab}$ of the test fields, i.e., $H_{ab}=\square_LT_{ab}/2$. In this
letter we show, for Einstein-Maxwell spacetimes in the full non-linear theory,
that, although, the trace of the Chevreton superenergy tensor $H_{ab}$ can
again be rearranged in the form of a generalised wave operator $\square_G$
acting on the electromagnetic energy momentum tensor, in this case the result
is also crucially dependent on Einstein's equations; hence we argue that the
divergence-free property of the tensor $H_{ab}=\square_GT_{ab}/2$ has
significant independent content beyond that of the divergence-free property of
$T_{ab}$.

is possible to associate the notions of temperature and entropy with them.
Several aspects of this connection are reviewed in a manner appropriate for
broad readership. The approach uses two essential principles: (a) the physical
theories must be formulated for each observer entirely in terms of variables
any given observer can access and (b) consistent formulation of quantum field
theory requires analytic continuation to the complex plane. These two
principles, when used together in spacetimes with horizons, are powerful enough
to provide several results in a unified manner. Since spacetimes with horizons
have a generic behaviour under analytic continuation, standard results of
quantum field theory in curved spacetimes with horizons can be obtained
directly (Sections III to VII). The requirements (a) and (b) also put strong
constraints on the action principle describing the gravity and, in fact, one
can obtain the Einstein-Hilbert action from the thermodynamic considerations.
The latter part of the review (Sections VIII to X) investigates this deeper
connection between gravity, spacetime microstructure and thermodynamics of
horizons. This approach leads to several interesting results in the
semiclassical limit of quantum gravity, which are described.

  When S have holes, we defined two moduli spaces closely related to the moduli
spaces of G-local systems on S. We show that they carry a lot of interesting
structures. In particular we define a distinguished collection of coordinate
systems, equivariant under the action of the mapping class group of S. We prove
that their transition functions are subtraction free. Thus we have positive
structures on these moduli spaces. Therefore we can take their points with
values in any positive semifield. Their positive real points provide the two
higher Teichmuller spaces related to G and S, while the points with values in
the tropical semifields provide the lamination spaces. We define the motivic
avatar of the Weil-Petersson form for one of these spaces. It is related to the
motivic dilogarithm.

be homotopy equivalent to Davis and Januszkiewicz's examples. It is therefore
natural to investigate the extent to which the homotopy type of a space is

showing that the singular cochain algebra of c(K) is formal as a differential

physics is the existence of a systematic and symmetry preserving truncation
scheme. This enables the proof of exact results; e.g., the leptonic decay
constant of every pseudoscalar meson except the pion vanishes in the chiral
limit. Calculations using the scheme's leading-order truncation are reliable in
the vector and flavour nonsinglet pseudoscalar channels. In this rainbow-ladder
truncation, an impulse approximation provides the consistent current for all
six-point quark Schwinger functions. That is well illustrated via the anomalous
process pi0 -> gamma gamma. Using two-, three- and four-point Schwinger
functions calculated in rainbow-ladder truncation, the textbook value of the
width is obtained algebraically and independent of model details if, and only

the 1980-1986 dome building eruptions. The spectrum of the generalized fractal
dimensions, i.e. Dq vs q, extracted from the data, allows us to identify two
main earthquake time-distribution patterns. The first one exhibits a
multifractal clustering correlated to the intense seismic swarms of the dome
building activity. The second one is characterized by an almost constant value
of Dq 1, as for a random uniform distribution. The time evolution of Dq (for
q=0,2) calculated on a fixed number of events window and at different depths,
shows that the brittle mechanical response of the shallow layers to rapid magma
intrusions, during the eruptive periods, is revealed by sharp changes, acting
at a short time scale (order of days), and by the lowest values of Dq (0.3).
Conversely, for deeper earthquakes, characterized by intense seismic swarms, Dq
do not show obvious changes during the whole analyzed period, suggesting that
the earthquakes, related to the deep magma supply system, are characterized by
a minor degree of clustering, which is independent of the eruptive activity.

short) method are two main quantum lower bound techniques. While recently
Ambainis showed that the polynomial method is not tight, the present paper aims
at studying the power and limitation of \emph{Alb}'s. We first use known
\emph{Alb}'s to derive $\Omega(n^{1.5})$ lower bounds for
\textsc{Bipartiteness}, \textsc{Bipartiteness Matching} and \textsc{Graph
Matching}, in which the lower bound for \textsc{Bipartiteness} improves the
previous $\Omega(n)$ one. We then show that all the three known Ambainis's
lower bounds have a limitation $\sqrt{N\cdot \min\{C_0(f), C_1(f)\}}$, where
$C_0(f)$ and $C_1(f)$ are the 0- and 1-certificate complexity, respectively.
This implies that for some problems such as \textsc{Triangle},
$k$-\textsc{Clique}, and \textsc{Bipartite/Graph Matching} which draw wide
interest and whose quantum query complexities are still open, the best known
lower bounds cannot be further improved by using Ambainis's techniques. Another
consequence is that all the Ambainis's lower bounds are not tight. For total

\{\sqrt{C_0(f)C_1(f)}, \sqrt{N\cdot CI(f)}\}$, where $CI(f)$ is the size of max
intersection of a 0-and a 1-certificate set. Again this implies that $Alb$'s
cannot improve the best known lower bound for some specific problems such as
\textsc{And-Or Tree}, whose precise quantum query complexity is still open.
Finally, we generalize the three known \emph{Alb}'s and give a new \emph{Alb}

"quant-ph/0311065","Hans Halvorson","Hans Halvorson and Jeffrey Bub","Can quantum cryptography imply quantum mechanics? Reply to Smolin","4 pages, LaTeX",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Clifton, Bub, and Halvorson (CBH) have argued that quantum mechanics can be
derived from three cryptographic, or broadly information-theoretic, axioms. But
Smolin disagrees, and he has given a toy theory that he claims is a
counterexample. Here we show that Smolin's toy theory violates an independence
condition for spacelike separated systems that was assumed in the CBH argument.
We then argue that any acceptable physical theory should satisfy this
independence condition.

unconditionally secure even using weak coherent pulses instead of single-photon
signals. The distances that can be covered by these methods are limited due to
the loss in the quantum channel (e.g. loss in the optical fiber) and in the
single-photon counters of the receivers. One can argue that the loss in the
detectors cannot be changed by an eavesdropper in order to increase the covered
distance. Here we show that the security analysis of this scenario is not as
easy as is commonly assumed, since already two-photon processes allow
eavesdropping strategies that outperform the known photon-number splitting
attack. For this reason there is, so far, no satisfactory security analysis
available in the framework of individual attacks.

governed by an untunable qubit-qubit interaction is presented. By concatenating
dynamical decoupling through bang-bang (BB) pulse with decoherence-free
subspaces (DFSs) encoding, we protect the quantum computer from
environment-induced decoherence that results in quantum information dissipating
into the environment. For the inherent qubit-qubit interaction that is
untunable in the quantum system, BB control plus DFSs encoding will eliminate
its undesired effect which spoils quantum information in qubits. We show how
this quantum system can be used to implement universal quantum computation.

rules of quantum mechanics impose bounds on how multi-qubit systems can be
correlated. In this paper we utilize a concept of entangled graphs with
weighted edges in order to analyze pure quantum states of multi-qubit systems.
Here qubits are represented by vertexes of the graph while the presence of
bi-partite entanglement is represented by an edge between corresponding
vertexes. The weight of each edge is defined to be the entanglement between the
two qubits connected by the edge, as measured by the concurrence. We prove that
each entangled graph with entanglement bounded by a specific value of the
concurrence can be represented by a pure multi-qubit state. In addition we
present a logic network with O(N2) elementary gates that can be used for
preparation of the weighted entangled graphs of N qubits.

simulations spanning five decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to rich
galaxy clusters. Our analysis confirms the proposal of Navarro, Frenk & White
(NFW) that the shape of LambdaCDM halo mass profiles differs strongly from a
power law and depends little on mass. The logarithmic slope of the
spherically-averaged density profile, as measured by beta=-dln(rho)/dln(r),
decreases monotonically towards the center and becomes shallower than
isothermal (beta<2) inside a characteristic radius, r_{-2}. Although the
fitting formula proposed by NFW provides a reasonably good approximation to the
density and circular velocity profiles of individual halos, systematic
deviations from the best NFW fits are also noticeable. Inside r_{-2}, the
profile of simulated halos gets shallower with radius more gradually than
predicted and, as a result, NFW fits tend to underestimate the dark matter
density in these regions. This discrepancy has been interpreted as indicating a
steeply divergent cusp, but our results suggest a different interpretation. We
use the density and enclosed mass at our innermost resolved radii to place
strong constraints on beta_{0}: density cusps as steep as r^{-1.5} are
inconsistent with most of our simulations, although beta_{0}=1 is still
consistent with our data. Our density profiles show no sign of converging to a
well-defined asymptotic inner power law. We propose a simple formula that
reproduces the radial dependence of the slope better than the NFW profile, and
so may minimize errors when extrapolating our results inward to radii not yet
reliably probed by numerical simulations.

internal shocks in an expanding relativistic wind. Our time dependent numerical
model describes cyclo-synchrotron emission and absorption, inverse and direct
Compton scattering, and e^\pm pair production and annihilation (including the
evolution of high energy electro-magnetic cascades). It allows, in particular,
a self-consistent calculation of the energy distribution of e^\pm pairs
produced by photon annihilation, and hence a calculation of the spectra
resulting when the scattering optical depth due to pairs, \tau_\pm, is high. We
show that emission peaks at ~1MeV for moderate to large \tau_\pm, reaching
\tau_\pm ~ 10^2. In this regime of large compactness we find that (i) A large
fraction of shock energy can escape as radiation even for large \tau_\pm; (ii)
The spectrum depends only weakly on the magnetic field energy fraction; (iii)
The spectrum is hard, epsilon^2 dN/depsilon \propto epsilon^\alpha with
0.5<\alpha<1, between the self absorption (epsilon_{ssa}= 10^{0.5\pm0.5} keV)
and peak (epsilon_{peak}= 10^{0.5\pm0.5} MeV) photon energy, (iv) and shows a
sharp cutoff at ~10 MeV; (v) Thermal Comptonization leads to emission peaking
at epsilon_peak>=30 MeV, and can not therefore account for observed GRB
spectra. For small compactness, spectra extend to >10 GeV with flux detectable
by GLAST, and the spectrum at low energy depends on the magnetic field energy
fraction. Comparison of the flux at ~1 GeV and ~ 100 keV may therefore allow to
determine the magnetic field strength. For both small and large compactness,
the spectra depend only weakly on the spectral index of the energy distribution
of accelerated electrons.

star-forming molecular gas. We find two major pieces of evidence for this
result: 1) the virial mass to molecular mass ratio found from the
interferometer observations in a variety of sources shows no clear trend with
metallicity; and 2) dwarf galaxies appear to exhibit a CO-to-radio continuum
relationship that is similar to that observed in larger, presumably metal-rich,
galaxies leaving little room for a large systematic variation of the CO-to-H2
conversion factor with metallicity in the star-forming gas.

the context of hierarchical scenarios of gravitational structure formation. We
find that at any cosmic epoch the voids have a size distribution which is
well-peaked about a characteristic void size which evolves self-similarly in
time. This is in distinct contrast to the distribution of virialized halo
masses which does not have a small-scale cut-off.
  In our model, the fate of voids is ruled by two processes. The first process
affects those voids which are embedded in larger underdense regions: the
evolution is effectively one in which a larger void is made up by the mergers
of smaller voids, and is analogous to how massive clusters form from the
mergers of less massive progenitors. The second process is unique to voids, and
occurs to voids which happen to be embedded within a larger scale overdensity:
these voids get squeezed out of existence as the overdensity collapses around
them. It is this second process which produces the cut-off at small scales.
  In the excursion set formulation of cluster abundance and evolution, solution
of the cloud-in-cloud problem, i.e., counting as clusters only those objects
which are not embedded in larger clusters, requires study of random walks
crossing one barrier. We show that a similar formulation of void evolution
requires study of a two-barrier problem: one barrier is required to account for
voids-in-voids, and the other for voids-in-clouds. Thus, in our model, the void
size distribution is a function of two parameters, one of which reflects the
dynamics of void formation, and the other the formation of collapsed objects.

metallicity distribution is bimodal, and show that these two sub-populations
have different properties. Using spectral line index measurements of the
brightest clusters, the metal-poor GCs have old ages like the Milky Way
globular clusters, while the metal-rich GCs have H-beta line-strengths that
could be interpreted as a mean age of ~5 (+3/-2) Gyr. Both populations appear
to have [Mg/Fe] ratios consistent with that of the Galactic GC system, although
this quantity is not very well-constrained. The kinematics of the metal-rich
GCs are similar to those of the planetary nebulae, exhibiting significant
rotation about a misaligned axis, while the metal-poor GCs have a higher
velocity dispersion and show a weaker kinematic correlation with the field
stars. The total gravitating mass of NGC 5128 derived from the GCs is in
excellent agreement with the value derived from stellar (PN) kinematics. We
suggest that these and other data support a picture in which the main body of
NGC 5128 was formed 3-8 Gyr ago by the dissipational merger of two unequal-mass

winds, independent of hydrodynamic simulations. Our motive is to determine
whether or not line-driven disk winds can account for the wide/broad UV
resonance absorption lines seen in cataclysmic variables (CVs) and
quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). In both CVs and QSOs observations generally
indicate that the absorption arising in the outflowing winds has a steady
velocity structure on time scales exceeding years (for CVs) and decades (for
QSOs). However, published results from hydrodynamic simulations of line-driven
disk winds are mixed, with some researchers claiming that the models are
inherently unsteady, while other models produce steady winds. The analytic
investigation presented here shows that if the accretion disk is steady, then
the line-driven disk wind emanating from it can also be steady. In particular,
we show that a gravitational force initially increasing along the wind
streamline, which is characteristic of disk winds, does not imply an unsteady
wind. The steady nature of line-driven disk winds is consistent with the 1D
streamline disk-wind models of Murray and collaborators and the 2.5D
time-dependent models of Pereyra and collaborators. This paper emphasizes the
underlying physics behind the steady nature of line-driven disk winds using
mathematically simple models that mimic the disk environment

observed non-circular motions of gas and stars in circumnuclear (one
kiloparsec- scale) regions. We have shown first of all that these motions are
caused by the gravitational potential of a large-scale bar. NGC3368 and NGC3786
have nuclear bars only, their isophotal twist at larger radii being connected
with the bright spiral arms. Three cases of inner polar disks in our sample
(NGC2681, NGC3368 and NGC5850) are considered. We found ionized-gas
counter-rotation in the central kiloparsec of the lenticular galaxy NGC3945.
Seven galaxies (NGC470, NGC2273, NGC2681, NGC3945, NGC5566, NGC5905, and
NGC6951) have inner mini-disks nested in large-scale bars. Minispiral
structures occur often in these nuclear disks. It is interesting that the
majority of the observed, morphological and kinematical, features in the sample
galaxies can be explained without the secondary bar hypothesis. Thus we suggest
that a dynamically independent secondary bar is a rarer phenomenon than follows
from isophotal analysis of the images only.

temperatures cold enough to allow the formation of molecules (e.g., carbon
monoxide). Our 3-D model corroborates the finding by Carlsson & Stein (1994)

electron re-acceleration by MHD turbulence (Gitti, Brunetti & Setti 2002). The
MHD turbulence is assumed to be frozen into the flow of the thermal ICM and
thus amplified in the cooling flow region. Here we present the application of
this model to a new mini-halo candidate, the cluster A2626, and compare the
results with those obtained for the mini-halo in the Perseus cluster. We
present VLA data at 330 MHz and 1.5 GHz of the diffuse radio emission observed
in A2626, and we show that its main properties can be explained by the model.
We find that the power necessary for the re-acceleration of the relic electron
population is only a factor ~ 0.7% of the maximum power that can be extracted
by the cooling flow (as estimated on the basis of the standard model). We also
discuss the observational properties of known mini-halos in connection with
those of host clusters, showing that the radio power of mini--halos increases
with the maximum power of cooling flows. This trend is expected in the
framework of the model. Possible effects of new Chandra and XMM-Newton
estimates of $\dot{M}$ on this trend are considered: we conclude that even if
earlier derived cooling rates were overestimated, cooling flow powers are still
well above the radio powers emitted by mini-halos.

stars, in an attempt to provide constraints on theoretical models of disc
photoionisation. By treating the accretion shock as a hotspot on the stellar
surface we show that Lyman continuum photons are produced at a rate
approximately three orders of magnitude lower than that produced by a
corresponding black body, and that a strong Lyman continuum is only emitted for
high mass accretion rates. When our models are extended to include a column of
material accreting on to the hotspot we find that the accretion column is
extremely optically thick to Lyman continuum photons. Further, we find that
radiative recombination of hydrogen atoms within the column is not an efficient
means of producing photons with energies greater than 13.6eV, and find that an
accretion column of any conceivable height suppresses the emission of Lyman
continuum photons to a level below or comparable to that expected from the
stellar photosphere. The photospheric Lyman continuum is itself much too weak
to affect disc evolution significantly, and we find that the Lyman continuum
emitted by an accretion shock is similarly unable to influence disc evolution
significantly. This result has important consequences for models which use
photoionisation as a mechanism to drive the dispersal of circumstellar discs,
essentially proving that an additional source of Lyman continuum photons must
exist if disc photoionisation is to be significant.

the evolution of the spectrum of the source over three decades in frequency,

declines the high-frequency spectrum at frequency nu steepens from nu^{-0.4} to
nu^{-0.6}, after which the spectral index remains at this latter terminal
value; a trend previously observed but hitherto not satisfactorily explained.
VLBA observations, for the first time, track over several days the expansion of
a sequence of knots whose initial diameters are approximately 8
milliarcseconds. The light-crossing time within these plasmons is of the same
order as the time-scale over which the spectrum is observed to evolve. We
contend that properly accounting for light-travel time effects in and between
plasmons which are initially optically thick, but which after expansion become
optically thin, explains the key features of the spectral evolution, for
example the observed timescale. Using the VLBA images, we have directly
measured for the first time the proper motions of individual knots, analysis of
which shows a two-sided jet whose axis is precessing. The best-fit jet speed is
roughly beta = 0.63 and the precession period is about 5 days, significantly
lower than fitted for a previous flare. Extrapolation of the positions of the

of La$_{1-x}$Gd$_x$MnO$_3$ is dominated by the relatively strong Mn-Mn
exchange. The weakening of the antiferromagnetic interactions due to the
significant decrease f the Mn-O-Mn bond angles leads to the continuous
suppression of the magnetic phase-transition temperatures into the
antiferromagnetic low-temperature phase for increasing Gd doping. The
magnetization can only be explained assuming canting of the manganese spins.
The magnetic moments of Gd are weakly antiferromagnetically coupled within the
sublattice and are antiferromagnetically coupled to the Mn moments. For
intermediate concentrations compensation points are found, below which the
spontaneous magnetization becomes negative. In pure GdMnO3 the Mn spins undergo
a transition into a complex, probably incommensurate magnetic structure at 41.5
K, followed by a further ordering transition at 16-20 K revealing weak
ferromagnetism due to canting and finally by the onset of magnetic order in the

renormalization-group recursion relations always present a symmetric fixed
point, associated with the critical behavior of the underlying uniform model.
If the aperiodic interactions, defined by s ubstitution rules, lead to relevant
geometric fluctuations, this fixed point becomes fully unstable, giving rise to
novel attractors of different nature. We present an explicit example in which
this new attractor is a two-cycle, with critical indices different from the

find a surprising closed curve whose points are attractors of period two,
associated with a marginal operator. Nevertheless, a scaling analysis indicates
that this attractor may lead to a new critical universality class. In order to
provide an independent confirmation of the scaling results, we turn to a direct
thermodynamic calculation of the specific-heat exponent. The thermodynamic free

introduced for spin systems, and is now extended to the two-polymer model with

The one-particle orientational distribution function has a nontrivial
dependence on the orientation and is needed as an input. Despite some
differences, the Ornstein-Zernike equation for molecular crystals has a similar
structure as for liquids. We solve both equations for hard ellipsoids on a sc
lattice. Compared to molecular liquids, the tensorial orientational correlators
exhibit less structure. However, depending on the lengths a and b of the
rotation axis and the perpendicular axes of the ellipsoids, different behavior
is found. For oblate and prolate ellipsoids with b >= 0.35 (units of the
lattice constant), damped oscillations in distinct directions of direct space
occur for some correlators. They manifest themselves in some correlators in
reciprocal space as a maximum at the Brillouin zone edge, accompanied by maxima
at the zone center for other correlators. The oscillations indicate alternating
orientational fluctuations, while the maxima at the zone center originate from
nematic-like orientational fluctuations. For a <= 2.5 and b <= 0.35, the
oscillations are weaker. For a >= 3.0 and b <= 0.35, no oscillations occur any
longer. For many of the correlators in reciprocal space, an increase of a at
fixed b leads to a divergence at the zone center q = 0, consistent with
nematic-like long range fluctuations, and for some oblate and prolate systems
with b ~< 1.0 a simultaneous tendency to divergence of few other correlators at
the zone edge is observed. Comparison with correlators from MC simulations

concepts started in the beginning of the XX century in connection with the
investigation of non-stoichiometric compounds (the berthollides) but did not
reach a critical level until recently. Most of the HTSC materials, however, are
actually non-stoichiometric nanocomposites, whose components ""dilute"" or
""stretch"" one another. Each component resides in an ""intermediate"" state, which
still remains poorly studied. For instance, in a system of particles having two
paired electrons each, the unbroken electron pairs may start tunneling at a
certain ""medium"" concentration with the system becoming a Bose superconductor
(the state between the insulator and the metal with BCS superconductivity). For
univalent atoms (Na,Ag), however, such possibility realizes neither in
intermediate nor in the final state. Univalent metals are not superconductors.
In the berthollides, however, a possible Jahn-Teller-Peierls-type instability
may give rise to formation of diatomic molecules (Na2, Ag2)with electron pairs,
and superconductivity can set in. It is possibly such systems that were
obtained by chance in experiments with univalent components and reported to

characterized by a phase diagram with two identifiable temperatures. By
studying the modification of the phase diagrams, the SWN effect on the two

properties that are completely determined by the unnaturally large D^0 \bar
D^{*0} scattering length a. Its narrow width can be explained by the
suppression by a factor of 1/a of decay modes other than the decay of a
constituent \bar D^{*0} or D^{*0}. Its production rates are also suppressed by
a factor of 1/a. A particularly predictive mechanism for generating the large
scattering length is the accidental fine-tuning of a P-wave charmonium state to
the D^0 \bar D^{*0} threshold.

valid when the typical supersymmetric scale M_SUSY is sufficiently larger than
the electroweak scale m_weak (\sim m_W, m_t) and the mass of the charged Higgs

value of the various supersymmetric masses. These results are compared with
those of an approximate calculation, already existing in the literature, that
is at the zeroth order in the expansion parameter (m_weak^2,m_H^2)/M_SUSY^2,
and with the results of two new approximate calculations in which the first and
second order in the same expansion parameter are retained, respectively. This
comparison allows us to assess whether the results of these three approximate

derived, i.e., whether they can be used for m_H^2 \gtap M_SUSY^2 and/or
M_SUSY^2 \sim m_weak^2. It is found that the zeroth-order approximation works
well even for m_H \gtap M_SUSY, provided M_SUSY^2 >> m_weak^2. The inclusion of
the higher-order terms improves the zeroth-order approximation for m_H^2 <<

equilibrium by introducing a non-perturbative formulation of the real time
evolution of the density matrix. The main ingredient is the real time effective
action for the electromagnetic field to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{em})$ and to all
orders in $\alpha_s$. The real time evolution is completely determined by the
solution of a \emph{classical stochastic} non-local Langevin equation which
provides a Dyson-like resummation of the perturbative expansion. The Langevin
equation is solved in closed form by Laplace transform in terms of the thermal
photon polarization. A quantum kinetic description emerges directly from this
formulation. We find that photons with $k \lesssim 200 ~{Mev}$
\emph{thermalize} as plasmon quasiparticles in the plasma on time scales $t
\sim 10-20 ~{fm}/c$ which is of the order of the lifetime of the QGP expected
at RHIC and LHC. We then obtain the direct photon yield to lowest order in
$\alpha_{em}$ and to leading logarithmic order in $\alpha_s$ in a
\emph{uniform} expansion valid at all time. The yield during a QGP lifetime $t
\sim 10 ~{fm}/c$ is systematically larger than that obtained with the
equilibrium formulation and the spectrum features a distinct flattening for $k
\gtrsim 2.5 ~{Gev}$. We discuss the window of reliability of our results, the
theoretical uncertainties in \emph{any} treatment of photon emission from a QGP
in LTE and the shortcomings of the customary S-matrix approach.

modern quantum calculations are, in general, numerically more efficient than
semiclassical methods, this situation can be reversed with increasing dimension
of the problem. For the 4-sphere system with large separations between the

energy regions which are unattainable with the currently available quantum

for both quantum and semiclassical techniques. Here, semiclassical resonances
are obtained via harmonic inversion of a cross-correlated periodic orbit

medium. Stochastic reconnection is a generic effect, due to field line
wandering, in which the speed of reconnection is determined by the ability of
ejected plasma to diffuse away from the current sheet along magnetic field
lines, rather than by the details of current sheet structure. We consider the
limit of weak stochasticity, so that the mean magnetic field energy density is
greater than either the turbulent kinetic energy density or the energy density
associated with the fluctuating component of the field. We consider field line
stochasticity generated through a turbulent cascade, which leads us to consider
the effect of neutral drag on the turbulent cascade of energy. In a
collisionless plasma, neutral particle viscosity and ion-neutral drag will damp
mid-scale turbulent motions, but the power spectrum of the magnetic
perturbations extends below the viscous cutoff scale. We give a simple physical
picture of the magnetic field structure below this cutoff, consistent with
numerical experiments. We provide arguments for the reemergence of the
turbulent cascade well below the viscous cut-off scale and derive estimates for
field line diffusion on all scales. We note that this explains the persistence
of a single power law form for the turbulent power spectrum of the interstellar
medium, from scales of tens of parsecs down to thousands of kilometers. We find
that under typical conditions in the ISM stochastic reconnection speeds are
reduced by the presence of neutrals, but by no more than an order of magnitude.

logic to partial states, defined here as sub-probability measures on the
Hilbert space, equipped with the natural pointwise partial ordering. The
sub-probability measures allow a certain probability for the non-termination of
the computation. We then derive an extension of Gleason's theorem and show
that, for Hilbert spaces of dimension greater than two, the partial order of
sub-probability measures is order isomorphic with the collection of partial
density operators, i.e., trace class positive operators with trace between zero
and one, equipped with the usual partial ordering induced from positive
operators. We show that the expected value of a bounded observable with respect

objects using maser spots at the parsec-scale. We find a new spectral window
for observing the self-gravitating accretion disc in super-Eddington accreting
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This window is determined by calculating the
outermost radius (rsg) of a non self-gravitating disc and the corresponding
emission wavelength (lsg) as a function of various disc parameters. We find
that lsg reaches ~ 4000 AA for alpha=0.1, when Mdot > 70 (M_BH / 10^7 M_Sun)^-1
L_Edd/c^2 (where alpha, Mdot, M_BH and L_Edd are, respectively, the viscosity
parameter, gas accretion rate onto the central black hole (BH), the BH mass and
the Eddington luminosity). Moreover, lsg is as small as 1500 AA for alpha =
0.001, which is the smallest alpha case in this study. Therefore, the window
for observing the self-gravitating part of an AGN accretion disc is from 2
micron to lsg. Incidentally, rsg can be less than the photon trapping radius
for Mdot >~ 10^3.3 L_Edd/c^2. Namely, a self-gravitating, optically-thick,
advection-dominated accretion disc is expected to appear in the extremely high
accretion rate regime.
  Next, we demonstrate that the Mid-Infrared to X-ray spectrum of a bright,
well-studied Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy, Ton S 180, is indeed well fitted by
the spectrum arising from the following three components: an inner slim disc
(with a corona), an outer, self-gravitating non-Keplerian disc and a dusty
torus. The total mass, BH mass plus the entire disc mass, is found to be about
(1.4 - 8.0) M_BH. If the surface density varies with radius r in proportion to
r^-0.6, the total mass is consistent with the central mass estimated by H_beta
and [O III] widths.

clusters. X-ray spectra show that very little of the hot intracluster medium is
cooler than about 1 keV, despite having short cooling times. In an increasing
number of cooling flow clusters, the lobes of a central radio source are found
to have created cavities in the hot gas. Generally, the cavities are not
overpressured relative to the intracluster gas, but act as buoyant bubbles of
radio emitting plasma that drive circulation as they rise, mixing and heating
the intracluster gas. All this points to the radio source, i.e. an active
galactic nucleus, as the heat source that prevents gas from cooling to low
temperatures. However, heating due to bubbles alone seems to be insufficient,
so the energetics of cooling flows remain obscure. We briefly review the data
and theory supporting this view and discuss the energetics of cooling flows.

proceeds from an initially unbound molecular cloud core. The turbulent motions,
which dominate the dynamics, dissipate in shocks leaving a quiescent region
which becomes gravitationally bound and collapses to form a small multiple
system. Meanwhile, the bulk of the cloud escapes due to its initial supersonic
velocities. In this simulation, the process naturally results in a star
formation efficiency of 50%. The mass involved in star formation depends on the
gas fraction that dissipates sufficient kinetic energy in shocks. Thus, clouds
with larger turbulent motions will result in lower star formation efficiencies.
This implies that globally unbound, and therefore transient giant molecular
clouds (GMCs), can account for the low efficiency of star formation observed in
our Galaxy without recourse to magnetic fields or feedback processes.
Observations of the dynamic stability in molecular regions suggest that GMCs
may not be self-gravitating, supporting the ideas presented in this letter.

existence of a faint, hard X-ray source population. While the nature of this
population is unknown, it is likely that several types of stellar objects
contribute. For sources involving binary systems, accreting white dwarfs and
accreting neutron stars with main sequence companions have been proposed. Among
the accreting neutron star systems, previous studies have focused on stellar
wind-fed sources. In this paper, we point out that binary systems in which mass
transfer occurs via Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) can also contribute to this
X-ray source population.
  A binary population synthesis study of the Galactic center region has been
carried out, and it is found that evolutionary channels for neutron star
formation involving the accretion induced collapse of a massive ONeMg white
dwarf, in addition to the core collapse of massive stars, can contribute to
this population. The RLOF systems would appear as transients with quiescent
luminosities, above 2 keV, in the range from 10^31-10^32 ergs/s. The results
reveal that RLOF systems primarily contribute to the faint X-ray source
population in the Muno et al. (2003) survey and wind-fed systems can contribute
to the less sensitive Wang et al. (2002) survey. However, our results suggest
that accreting neutron star systems are not likely to be the major contributor
to the faint X-ray source population in the Galactic center.

significant portion of the stellar disk. The remaining 2 stars also have blue
absorption extending below the continuum although here the profiles are

that the short period and an assumed main sequence companion constrain the mass

during one of the Chandra observations and a subsequent XMM-Newton observation
constrains the mass of the compact object to less than about 60 solar masses.
If such a system lies in the Circinus galaxy, then the accreting object must
either radiate anisotropically or strongly violate the Eddington limit. Even if
the emission is beamed, then the companion star which intercepts this flux
during eclipse will be driven out of thermal equilibrium and evaporate within
about 1000 years. We find that the observations cannot rule out an AM Her
system in the Milky Way and that such a system can account for the variations

derive colours and luminosity functions of galaxies at z=3 after applying local

the simulated galaxies have U-G and G-R colours consistent with observations,

properties of LBGs, including their number density, colours, and luminosity
functions, can be explained if LBGs are identified with the most massive
galaxies at z=3, having typical stellar mass of M_{star} ~ 1e10 Msun/h, a
conclusion broadly consistent with earlier studies based on hydrodynamic
simulations of the Lamda CDM model. We also find that most simulated LBGs were

an association between their jets and regions of active star formation. The
standard picture is that shocks generated by the jet propagate through an
inhomogeneous medium and trigger the collapse of overdense clouds, which then
become active star-forming regions. In this contribution, we report on recent
hydrodynamic simulations of radiative shock-cloud interactions using two
different cooling models: an equilibrium cooling-curve model assuming solar
metallicities and a non-equilibrium chemistry model appropriate for primordial
gas clouds. We consider a range of initial cloud densities and shock speeds in
order to quantify the role of cooling in the evolution. Our results indicate
that for moderate cloud densities (>1 cm^{-3}) and shock Mach numbers (<20),
cooling processes can be highly efficient and result in more than 50% of the
initial cloud mass cooling to below 100 K. We also use our results to estimate
the final H_2 mass fraction for the simulations that use the non-equilibrium
chemistry package. This is an important measurement, since H_2 is the dominant
coolant for a primordial gas cloud. We find peak H_2 mass fractions of >0.01
and total H_2 mass fractions of >10^{-5} for the cloud gas. Finally, we compare
our results with the observations of jet-induced star formation in
``Minkowski's Object.'' We conclude that its morphology, star formation rate (~

interaction of a 90,000 km/s jet with an ensemble of moderately dense (~ 10

narrowly collimated into jets. After correcting for this jet geometry there is
a remarkable constancy of both the energy radiated by the burst and the kinetic
energy carried by the outflow. Gamma-ray bursts are still the most luminous
explosions in the Universe, but they release energies that are comparable to
supernovae. The diversity of cosmic explosions appears to be governed by the
fraction of energy that is coupled to ultra-relativistic ejecta.

intermediate mass black hole accreting at sub-Eddington rates, but other
scenarios which require high advection efficiencies from a hollowed-out disk
might be possible. The emission from X10 can be characterised by a single
power-law. This source can be interpreted either as an intermediate mass black
hole, or as a stellar-mass black hole with relativistically-beamed Comptonised
emission. There are four optical counterparts in the error circle of X7. No
counterparts are evident in the error circle for X10.

their galactic centers. The galaxy spectra are roughly flat from 1.7 to 43 GHz,
rather than steepening to classical optically thin synchrotron spectra at high

advection-dominated accretion flows, the luminosities are too high for the
black hole masses of the galaxies and the slight spectral steepening at high
frequencies cannot be explained by standard simple models of such accretion
flows. In contrast, compact jets can accommodate the average spectral index,
the relatively high radio luminosity, and the unresolved appearance, but only
if the jets in all six galaxies are fairly close to our line of sight. This
constraint is in agreement with inclination angle predictions for five of the

optically bright bipolar nebula, the Homunculus and a fainter but much larger
nebula, the so-called outer ejecta. As images from the EINSTEIN and ROSAT
satellites have shown, the outer ejecta is also visible in soft X-rays, while
the central source is present in the harder X-ray bands. With our CHANDRA
observations we show that the morphology and properties of the X-ray nebula are
the result of shocks from fast clumps in the outer ejecta moving into a
pre-existing denser circumstellar medium. An additional contribution to the
soft X-ray flux results from mutual interactions of clumps within the ejecta.
Spectra extracted from the CHANDRA data yield gas temperatures kT of 0.6-0.76
keV. The implied pre-shock velocities of 670-760 km/s are within the scatter of
the velocities we measure for the majority of the clumps in the corresponding
regions. Significant nitrogen enhancements over solar abundances are needed for
acceptable fits in all parts of the outer ejecta, consistent with CNO processed
material and non-uniform enhancement. The presence of a diffuse spot of hard
X-ray emission at the S condensation shows some contribution of the highest
velocity clumps and further underlines the multicomponent, non-equilibrium
nature of the X-ray nebula. The detection of an X-ray ``bridge'' between the
northern and southern part of the X-ray nebula and an X-ray shadow at the
position of the NN bow can be attributed to a large expanding disk, which would
appear as an extension of the equatorial disk. No soft emission is seen from
the Homunculus, or from the NN bow or the ``strings''.

after subtraction of the red giant contribution. Based on our new radial

masses of T CrB. It is found that the hot component is most likely a massive
white dwarf. We estimate the inclination and the component masses to be i~67
deg, Mwd = 1.37 +/-0.13 Msun and Msec=1.12 +/-0.23 Msun, respectively. The
radial velocity of the central dip in the H-alpha profile changes nearly in
phase with that of the red giant's absorption lines. This suggests that the dip
is most likely produced by absorption in the giant's wind.
  Our observations cover an interval when the H-alpha and the U-band flux vary
by a factor of ~6, while the variability in B and V is much smaller. Based on
our observations, and archival ultraviolet and optical data we show that the
optical, ultraviolet and H-alpha fluxes strongly correlate. We argue that the

the consequences if starspot areas were similarly distributed. The solar data

  Models","submitted to ApJ, 79pp with 17 figs",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present a flexible framework for constructing physical models of quasar
evolution that can incorporate a variety of observational constraints, such as
multi-wavelength luminosity functions, estimated masses and accretion rates of
active black holes, space densities of quasar hosts, and the local black hole
mass function. We focus on the accretion rate distribution p(mdot|M,z), the
probability that a black hole of mass M at redshift z accretes at a rate mdot
in Eddington units. Given the radiative efficiency as a function of mdot, the
quasar luminosity function (QLF) is determined by a convolution of p(mdot|M,z)
with the black hole mass function n(M,z). In the absence of mergers p(mdot|M,z)
also determines the full evolution of n(M,z), given a ""boundary value"" of n(M)
at some redshift. Matching the observed decline of the QLF break luminosity at
z<2 requires either a shift towards lower characteristic accretion rates or an
evolving mass dependence of p(mdot) that preferentially shuts off accretion
onto high mass black holes. These two scenarios make different predictions for
the masses and accretion rates of active black holes. If the first mechanism
dominates, then the QLF changes character between z=2 and z=0, shifting from a
sequence of black hole mass towards a sequence of L/Ledd. We construct and
compare five models that illustrate different assumptions about the quasar
population: short and long lifetime models dominated by unobscured thin-disk
accretion, a model with a high fraction of obscured quasars, and models in
which mergers or ADAF accretion produce substantial black hole growth at low
redshift. We discuss the observational advances that would be most valuable for
distinguishing such models and for pinning down the physics that drives black
hole and quasar evolution. (Abridged)

clear sign that the collective behavior of investors loses some of its

generating distribution $\mu$ of the sequences $x_1x_2x_3...$ is known. If
$\mu$ is unknown, but known to belong to a countable or continuous class $\M$
one can base ones prediction on the Bayes-mixture $\xi$ defined as a
$w_\nu$-weighted sum or integral of distributions $\nu\in\M$. The cumulative
expected loss of the Bayes-optimal universal prediction scheme based on $\xi$
is shown to be close to the loss of the Bayes-optimal, but infeasible
prediction scheme based on $\mu$. We show that the bounds are tight and that no
other predictor can lead to significantly smaller bounds. Furthermore, for
various performance measures, we show Pareto-optimality of $\xi$ and give an
Occam's razor argument that the choice $w_\nu\sim 2^{-K(\nu)}$ for the weights
is optimal, where $K(\nu)$ is the length of the shortest program describing
$\nu$. The results are applied to games of chance, defined as a sequence of
bets, observations, and rewards. The prediction schemes (and bounds) are
compared to the popular predictors based on expert advice. Extensions to
infinite alphabets, partial, delayed and probabilistic prediction,
classification, and more active systems are briefly discussed.

the quark and lepton mass matrices and the bilarge neutrino oscillations. In

recently discovered X(3872). Taking the experimental mass as input, we give
numerical results for the E1 radiative widths as well as the three principal
types of strong decays; open-charm, ccbar annihilation and closed-charm
hadronic transitions. We find that many assignments may be immediately
eliminated due to the small observed total width. The remaining viable ccbar
assignments are 3D3, 3D2, 1D2, 2 3P1 and 2 1P1. A search for the mode J/psi pi0
pi0 can establish the C-parity of the X(3872), which will eliminate many of
these possibilities. Radiative transitions can then be used to test the
remaining assignments, as they populate characteristic final states. The 3D2
and 1D2 states are predicted to have large (ca.50%) radiative branching
fractions to chi_1 gamma and h_c gamma respectively. We predict that the 3D3
will also be relatively narrow and will have a significant (ca.10%) branching
fraction to chi_2 gamma, and should also be observable in B decay. Tests for
non-ccbar X(3872) assignments are also discussed.

analysis of stochastic queueing networks, specifically for the analysis of
stability. It is known that stability of a fluid model implies positive
(Harris) recurrence (stability) of a corresponding stochastic queueing network,
and weak stability implies rate stability of a corresponding stochastic
network. These results have been established both for cases of specific
scheduling policies and for the class of all work conserving policies.
  However, only partial converse results have been established and in certain
cases converse statements do not hold. In this paper we close one of the
existing gaps. For the case of networks with two stations we prove that if the
fluid model is not weakly stable under the class of all work conserving
policies, then a corresponding queueing network is not rate stable under the
class of all work conserving policies. We establish the result by building a
particular work conserving scheduling policy which makes the associated
stochastic process transient. An important corollary of our result is that the
condition $\rho^*\leq 1$, which was proven in \cite{daivan97} to be the exact
condition for global weak stability of the fluid model, is also the exact
global rate stability condition for an associated queueing network. Here

assume that the perturbation is time independent, random and orthogonally
invariant. This allows to use a basis in which the unperturbed Hamiltonian is
diagonal and its properties are thus largely determined by its spectral
statistics. We concentrate on the effect of spectral correlations usually
associated to chaos and disregard secular variations in spectral density. We
obtain analytic results for the fidelity decay in the linear response regime.
To extend the domain of validity, we heuristically exponentiate the linear
response result. The resulting expressions, exact in the perturbative limit,
are accurate approximations in the transition region between the ``Fermi golden
rule'' and the perturbative regimes, as examplarily verified for a
deterministic chaotic system. To sense the effect of spectral stiffness, we
apply our model also to the extreme cases of random spectra and equidistant
spectra. In our analytical approximations as well as in extensive Monte Carlo
calculations, we find that fidelity decay is fastest for random spectra and
slowest for equidistant ones, while the classical ensembles lie in between. We
conclude that spectral stiffness systematically enhances fidelity.

such scaling can be used to estimate high energy neutrino cross sections from
low energy neutrino cross sections. This argument has lead to questions on the

factors at high momentum transfer. When wave functions that reproduce the

smaller than expected. As a consequence, that experiment was taken as an
evidence that there is no ether and, as such, played a crucial role for
deciding between Lorentzian Relativity and Einstein's Special Relativity.
However, according to some authors, the observed Earth's velocity was not
negligibly small. To provide an independent check, we have re-analyzed the
fringe shifts observed in each of the six different sessions of the
Michelson-Morley experiment. They are consistent with a non-zero observable
Earth's velocity $v_{\rm obs} = 8.4 \pm 0.5 km/s$. Assuming the existence of a
preferred reference frame and using Lorentz transformations, this $v_{\rm obs}$
corresponds to a real velocity, in the plane of the interferometer, $v_{\rm
earth} = 201 \pm 12 km/s$. This value, which is remarkably consistent with 1932
Miller's cosmic solution, suggests that the magnitude of the fringe shifts is
determined by the typical velocity of the solar system within our galaxy. This
conclusion is consistent with the results of all classical experiments

of kinetic parameters, which suggests that the steady states are determined by
the topology of the network and the type of regulatory interactions between
components, not the detailed form of the rate laws. To investigate this, we
propose and analyze a Boolean model of this network which is based on a binary
ON/OFF representation of transcription and protein levels, and in which the
interactions are formulated as logical functions. In this model the spatial and
temporal patterns of gene expression are determined by the topology of the
network and whether components are present or absent, rather than the absolute
levels of the mRNAs and proteins and the functional details of their
interactions. The model is able to reproduce the wild type gene expression
patterns, as well as the ectopic expression patterns observed in
over-expression experiments and various mutants. Furthermore, we compute
explicitly all steady states of the network and identify the basin of
attraction of each steady state. The model gives important insights into the
functioning of the segment polarity gene network, such as the crucial role of
the wingless and sloppy paired genes, and the network's ability to correct
errors in the prepattern.

reduced time evolution. In contrast to the frequently considered case of an
initial preparation where the total density matrix factorizes into a product of
a system density matrix and a bath density matrix the time evolution generally
is no longer governed by a linear map nor is this map affine. Put differently,
the evolution is truly nonlinear and cannot be cast into the form of a linear
map plus a term that is independent of the initial density matrix of the open
quantum system. As a consequence, the inhomogeneity that emerges in formally
exact generalized master equations is in fact a nonlinear term that vanishes
for a factorizing initial state. The general results are elucidated with the
example of two interacting spins prepared at thermal equilibrium with one spin
subjected to an external field. The second spin represents the environment. The
field allows the preparation of mixed density matrices of the first spin that
can be represented as a convex combination of two limiting pure states, i.e.
the preparable reduced density matrices make up a convex set. Moreover, the map
from these reduced density matrices onto the corresponding density matrices of
the total system is affine only for vanishing coupling between the spins. In
general, the set of the accessible total density matrices is nonconvex.

short-time phenomenon with decay rates typically much smaller than typical
dissipative decay rates. We discuss two approaches to the problem both of which
use a quantum Langevin equation (QLE) as a starting-point: (a) use of a reduced
WDF but in the context of an exact master equation (b) use of a WDF for the
complete system corresponding to entanglement at all times.

problem for a given time-independent potential, for each state of the whole
quantum ensemble of identically prepared particles, there is an unique pair of
(subensemble's) solutions to the Schr\""odinger equation, which, as we
postulate, describe separately transmission and reflection: in the case of
nonstationary states, for any instant of time, these functions are orthogonal
and their sum describes the state of all particles; evolving with constant
norms, one of them approaches at late times the transmitted wave packet and
another approaches the reflected packet. Both for transmission and reflection,
1) well before and after the scattering event, the average kinetic energy of
particles is the same, 2) the average starting point differs, in the general
case, from that for all particles. It is shown that for reflection, in the case
of symmetric potential barriers, the domain of the motion of particles is
bounded by the midpoint of the barrier region. We define (exact and asymptotic)
transmission and reflection times and show that the basic results of our
formalism can be, in principle, checked experimentally.

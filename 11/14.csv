brighter than the peak of the luminosity function of Milky Way globular

a minimum normal, compared to spiral galaxies. However, since only a small

progenitors, interacting with either the freely expanding wind of the
progenitor or the shocked wind. We present models for the afterglows of GRB
020405 and GRB 021211, which are a challenge to wind interaction models.
Considering sources for which wind interaction models are acceptable, a range
of wind densities is required, from values typical of Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars
to values ~100 times smaller. The reason for the low densities is unclear, but
may involve low progenitor masses and/or low metallicities. If mass is a
factor, a low density event should be associated with a low mass supernova. The
interpretation of bursts apparently interacting with constant density media as
interaction with a shocked wind requires both a range of mass loss densities
and a range of external pressures. The highest pressures, p/k > 10^8 cm^{-3} K,
may be due to an extreme starburst environment, which would imply that the
burst is superposed on an active star forming region. Although the range of
observed events can be accomodated by the shocked wind theory, special
circumstances are necessary to bring this about. Finally, we consider the high
velocity, high ionization absorption features observed in some afterglow
spectra. If the features are circumstellar, the presence of the burst in a
starburst region may be important for the formation of clumps near the burst.

one another on a time scale of 10^7yr. The supersonic collisions result in
spatially distributed star formation with high efficiency. We then show that
most, subsequent star formation in cold atomic clouds may be triggered by
shockwaves launched from the first stars formed in collisions. Those
shockwave-compressed clouds are even more widespread spatially because of large
imparted velocities and some can possibly escape into the intergalactic medium.
More importantly, with respect to cosmological reionization, widespread star
formation would allow a much higher ionizing photon escape fraction. These
favorable conditions may form the physical basis to enable the standard
cosmological model to produce a reasonably high Thomson optical depth
\tau_e=0.10-0.14. A chain reaction of star formation in minihalos in the
intergalactic space may be triggered by explosions in the intergalactic medium,
if minihalos are strongly clustered. In this case, a still higher \tau_e would
be achievable.

rate density history from local observations and in doing so to gain insight
into how galaxies might have formed and evolved. A new chemical evolution model
is described which accounts for the formation of globular clusters as well as
the accompanying field stars. When this model is used in conjunction with the
observed age metallicity relations for the clusters and with input which allows
for the formation of the nearly universally observed bimodal distribution of
globular clusters, star formation rates are obtained. By confining attention to
a representative volume of the local universe, these rates allow a successful
reconstruction of the Madau plot while complementary results similtaneously
satisfy many local cosmological constraints. A physical framework for galaxy
formation is presented which incorporates the results from this chemical
evolution model and assumes an anisotropic collapse. In addition to providing
the `classical' halo, bulge and disk components, the model also predicts a new
stellar halo component with peak [Fe/H] ~ -0.8 and disk-like angular momentum
and allows for the formation of a thick disk as outlined by the group of metal
rich globular clusters. Milky Way counterparts of the latter two components are

genetic anomalies were reported in the plants, insects and people of the

found not only within the epicenter area, but also along the trajectory of the
Tunguska Space Body (TSB). At that no traces of radioactivity were found, which
could be reliably associated with the Tunguska event. The main hypotheses about
the nature of the TSB, a stony asteroid, a comet nucleus or a carbonaceous
chondrite, readily explain the absence of radioactivity but give no clues how
to deal with the genetic anomaly. A choice between these hypotheses, as far as
the genetic anomaly is concerned, is like to the choice between ``blue devil,
green devil and speckled devil'', to quote late Academician N.V. Vasilyev.
However, if another mysterious phenomenon, electrophonic meteors, is evoked,
the origin of the Tunguska genetic anomaly becomes less obscure.

Non-axisymmetric as well as axisymmetric perturbations are added to the initial
state and the subsequent evolutions are studied. The evolution is characterized
by three parameters: the amplitude of the non-axisymmetric perturbations, the
rotation speed, and the magnetic field strength. As a result, it is found that
non-axisymmetry hardly evolves in the early phase, but begins to grow after the
gas contracts and forms a thin disk. Disk formation is strongly promoted by the
rotation speed and the magnetic field strength. There are two types of
fragmentation: fragmentation from a ring and that from a bar. Thin adiabatic
cores fragment if a thickness is smaller than 1/4 of the radius. For the
fragments to survive, they should be formed in a heavily elongated barred core
or a flat round disk. In the models showing fragmentation, outflows from
respective fragments are found as well as those driven by the rotating bar or
the disk.

a few tens of TeV. To explain the observed scale lengths, we construct two
simple models with a test particle approximation, where the maximum energy of
accelerated electrons is determined by the age of SN1006 (age-limited model) or
the energy loss (energy loss-limited model), and constrain the magnetic field
configuration and the diffusion coefficients of accelerated electrons. When the
magnetic field is nearly parallel to the shock normal, the magnetic field
should be in the range of 20-85 micro Gauss and highly turbulent both in
upstream and downstream, which means that the mean free path of accelerated
electrons is on the order of their gyro-radius (Bohm limit). This situation can
be realized both in the age-limited and energy loss-limited model. On the other
hand, when the magnetic field is nearly perpendicular to the shock normal,
which can exist only in the age-limited case, the magnetic field is several
micro Gauss in the upstream and 14-20 micro Gauss in the downstream, and the
upstream magnetic field is less turbulent than the downstream.

obtained from stars at the base of the RGB is virtually the same as that
obtained from the dwarfs. Na and O abundances show a star-to-star scatter and
are anti-correlated, not unlike previous finding in more metal-poor clusters.
The extension of the anticorrelation is not as extreme as found in other
clusters, but it is clearly present in unevolved stars. Al abundances do not
show a significant spread; this could be indicative that p-captures in high
temperature regions are less likely to occur in metal-rich clusters. The
[alpha/Fe] ratios suggest a slight excess of Ti with respect to field stars of
similar metallicities. Finally, we found an enhanced odd-even effect for
Fe-group elements. In particular, the [Mn/Fe] ratio is almost 0.2 dex deficient

the solar neighborhood. While the theoretical and observational framework for

the gravitational potential is strongly correlated with the distribution of
luminosity: either the luminous mass dominates or there is a close coupling
between luminous and dark matter. In a similar way, the declining rotation
curves observed in the outer parts of high luminosity systems are a clear
signature of the stellar disk which either dominates or traces the distribution

  The notion that the baryons are dynamically important in the centres of

detachment of active strands from their junctions and merging of dangling
strands with the network. The network is assumed to be strongly heterogeneous

rearrangement of strands and the standard deviation of activation energies)

modern statistical mechanics and condensed matter theory. A central concept is
the observable `order parameter', whose non-zero average value characterizes
one or more phases and usually breaks a symmetry of the Hamiltonian. At large
distances and long times, fluctuations of the order parameter(s) are described
by a continuum field theory, and these dominate the physics near such phase
transitions. In this paper we show that near second order quantum phase
transitions, subtle quantum interference effects can invalidate this paradigm.
We present a theory of quantum critical points in a variety of experimentally
relevant two-dimensional antiferromagnets. The critical points separate phases
characterized by conventional `confining' order parameters. Nevertheless, the
critical theory contains a new emergent gauge field, and `deconfined' degrees
of freedom associated with fractionalization of the order parameters. We
suggest that this new paradigm for quantum criticality may be the key to
resolving a number of experimental puzzles in correlated electron systems.

is in its ground state, but quantum noise remains as a fundamental limit to the
accuracy of experimental measurements. Such a limitation, however, can be
mitigated by the formation of squeezed states. Quantum mechanically, a squeezed
state is a time-varying superposition of states for which the noise of a
particular observable is reduced below that of the ground state at certain
times. Quantum squeezing has been achieved for a variety of systems, including
the electromagnetic field, atomic vibrations in solids and molecules, and
atomic spins, but not so far for magnetic systems. Here we report on an
experimental demonstration of spin wave (i.e., magnon) squeezing. Our method
uses femtosecond optical pulses to generate correlations involving pairs of
magnons in an antiferromagnetic insulator, MnF2. These correlations lead to
quantum squeezing in which the fluctuations of the magnetization of a
crystallographic unit cell vary periodically in time and are reduced below that
of the ground state quantum noise. The mechanism responsible for this squeezing
is stimulated second order Raman scattering by magnon pairs. Such squeezed
states have important ramifications in the emerging fields of spintronics and
quantum computing involving magnetic spin states or the spin-orbit coupling
mechanism.

the user source code nor in the language compiler.
  We give a number of applications of the foldt operator to compute monitors

the classical gravity action with cosmological constant, we study the effect
from the dilaton on the scale factor (this corresponds to an inflationary
universe without dilaton). It is shown that, depending on the initial
conditions for the dilaton, the dilaton may slow down or accelerate the
inflation process. At late times the dilaton is decaying exponentially.
Different possible cases corresponding to a dilatonic dS Universe are analyzed
with respect to the equations of motion.

the cosmological consequences of a ""running CC"" by addressing the accelerated

slow, without fine-tuning, and is comparable to H^2 M_P^2. It can be described
by a single parameter, \nu, that can be determined from already planned
experiments using SNe Ia at high z. The range of allowed values for \nu follow
mainly from nucleosynthesis restrictions. Present samples of SNe Ia can not yet
distinguish between a ""constant"" CC or a ""running"" one. The numerical
simulations presented in this work show that SNAP can probe the predicted
variation of the CC either ruling out this idea or confirming the evolution

sector in $t\bar t$ production at a $\gamma\gamma$-collider, via the process $
\gamgam \ra \phi \ra t \bar t$ where the $\phi$ is a scalar with indeterminate
CP parity. The study is performed in a model independent way parametrising the
CP violating couplings in terms of six form factors $\{\Re(S_{\gamma}),
\Im(S_{\gamma}), \Re(P_{\gamma}), \Im(P_{\gamma}), S_t, P_t\}$. The CP
violation is reflected in the polarisation asymmetry of the produced top quark.
We use the angular distribution of the decay lepton from $t/\bar t$ as a
diagnostic of this polarisation asymmetry and hence of the CP mixing, after
showing that the asymmetries in the angular distribution are indpendent of any
CP violation in the $tbW$ vertex. We construct combined asymmetries in the
initial state lepton (photon) polarization and the final state lepton charge
and study how well different combinations of these form factors can be probed
by measurements of these asymmetries, using circularly polarized photons. We
demonstrate the feasibility of the method to probe CP violation in the Higgs
sector at the level induced by loop effects in supersymmetric theories, using
realistic photon spectra expected for a TESLA like $e^+ e^-$ collider. We
investigate the sensitivity of our method for for different widths of the
scalar as well as for the more realistic backscattered laser photon spectrum
resulting from the inlcusion of the nonlinear effects.

the sigma process of resolution of singularities. The physics described by this
model is dramatically different and much richer than that of the corresponding

is given by the regularization parameter of the butterfly state, which can be

equation of motion can be solved for an arbitrary component of the Fock space
up to a positive power of the expansion parameter. The energy density of the
solution is well-defined and remains finite even in the singular butterfly
limit, and it gives approximately 68% of the D25-brane tension for the solution
at the leading order. Moreover, it simultaneously solves the equation of motion
of vacuum string field theory, providing support for the conjecture at this
order. We further improve our ansatz by taking into account next-to-leading
terms, and find two numerical solutions which give approximately 88% and 109%,
respectively, of the D25-brane tension for the energy density. These values are
interestingly close to those by level truncation at level 2 without gauge

  The analyses of both compactness and condition (P) boil down to properties of

However, in the presence of two-body random interactions, the predominance of
$I^{\pi}=0^+$ ground states (0 g.s.) was found to be robust both for bosons and
for an even number of fermions. For simple systems, such as $d$ bosons, $sp$
bosons, $sd$ bosons, and a few fermions in single-$j$ shells for small $j$,
there are a few approaches to predict and/or explain spin $I$ ground state ($I$
g.s.) probabilities. An empirical approach to predict $I$ g.s. probabilities is
available for general cases, such as fermions in a single-$j$ ($j>7/2$) or
many-$j$ shells and various boson systems, but a more fundamental understanding
of the robustness of 0 g.s. dominance is still out of reach. Further
interesting results are also reviewed concerning other robust phenomena of
many-body systems in the presence of random two-body interactions, such as the
odd-even staggering of binding energies, generic collectivity, the behavior of
average energies, correlations, and regularities of many-body systems

accurate overall (error statistics for total atomization energies approximately
cut in half) and more robust (particularly towards systems exhibiting
significant nondynamical correlation) than W2 theory. The cardinal improvement
rests in an approximate account for post-CCSD(T) correlation effects. Iterative
T_3 (connected triple excitations) effects exhibit a basis set convergence
behavior similar to the T_3 contribution overall. They almost universally
decrease molecular binding energies. Their inclusion in isolation yields less
accurate results than CCSD(T) nearly across the board: it is only when T_4
(connected quadruple excitations) effects are included that superior
performance is achieved. $T_4$ effects systematically increase molecular
binding energies. Their basis set convergence is quite rapid, and even
CCSDTQ/cc-pVDZ scaled by an empirical factor of 1.2532 will yield a quite
passable quadruples contribution. The effect of still higher-order excitations
was gauged for a subset of molecules (notably the eight-valence electron
systems): T_5 (connected quintuple excitations) contributions reach 0.3
kcal/mol for the pathologically multireference X ^1\Sigma^+_g state of C_2 but
are quite small for other systems. A variety of avenues for achieving accuracy
beyond that of W3 theory were explored, to no significant avail. W3 thus
appears to represent a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost
for those seeking a robust method for computational thermochemistry in the
kJ/mol accuracy range on small systems.

uniqueness of boson paths can be enforced under well determined conditions.
This in turn fixes the nonrelativistic particle equations of the
nonrelativistic Schrodinger equation, which appear to correspond with the
original definitions given by de Broglie and Bohm only in the spin-0 case.
Similar to the spin-1/2 case, there appears an additional spin-dependent term
in the guidance equation in the spin-1 case. We also discuss the ambiguity
associated with the introduction of an electromagnetic coupling in the Kemmer
theory. We argue that when the minimal coupling is correctly introduced, then
the current constructed from the energy-momentum tensor is no longer conserved.
Hence this current can not serve as a particle probability four-vector.

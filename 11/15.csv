theories of star formation. It is estimated by Zeeman splitting measurements in
a few dense molecular cores, but its volume--averaged value within large
molecular clouds (over several parsecs) is still uncertain. In this work we
provide a new method to constrain the average magnetic field strength in
molecular clouds. We compare the power spectrum of gas density of molecular
clouds with that of two $350^3$ numerical simulations of supersonic MHD
turbulence. The numerical simulation with approximate equipartition of kinetic
and magnetic energies (model A) yields the column density power spectrum
$P(k)\propto k^{-2.25\pm 0.01}$, the super--Alfv\'{e}nic simulation (model B)
$P(k)\propto k^{-2.71\pm 0.01}$. The column density power spectrum of the
Perseus, Taurus and Rosetta molecular cloud complexes is found to be well
approximated by a power law, $P_{\rm o}(k)\propto k^{-a}$, with $a=2.74\pm
0.07$, $2.74\pm 0.08$ and $2.76\pm 0.08$ respectively. We conclude that the
observations are consistent with the presence of super--Alfv\'{e}nic turbulence
in molecular clouds (model B) while model A is inconsistent (more than 99%
confidence) with the observations.

concentration (C), asymmetry (A), and clumpiness (S) in the rest-frame
near-ultraviolet/optical wavelengths for 150 bright local ""normal"" Hubble type

G-M20-C, where early-types have high G and C and low M20 and late-type spirals
have lower G and C and higher M20. The majority of ULIRGs lie above the normal
galaxy G-M20 sequence, due to their high G and M20 values. Their high Gini
coefficients arise from very bright nuclei, while the high second-order moments
are produced by multiple nuclei and bright tidal tails. All of these features
are signatures of recent and on-going mergers and interactions. We also find
that in combination with A and S, G is more effective than C at distinguishing
ULIRGs from the ""normal"" Hubble-types. Finally, we measure the morphologies of
45 1.7 < z < 3.8 galaxies from HST NICMOS observations of the Hubble Deep Field

fragmentation during the formation of primordial protostars are investigated
analytically. We introduce approximations for H2 cooling rates bridging the
optically thin and thick regimes. These allow us to discuss instabilities up to
densities when protostars become optically thick to continuum radiation
(n~10^16 cm^-3). During the collapse, instability arises at two different
stages: at low density (n~10^8-10^11 cm^-3), it is due to fast 3-body reactions
converting H into H2; at high density (n>10^13 cm^-3), it is due to Collisional
Induced Emission (CIE). In agreement with the 3D simulations, we find that the
instability at low densities cannot lead to fragmentation, because fluctuations
do not survive turbulent mixing, and because their growth is slow. The
situation at high density is similar. The CIE-induced instability is as weak as
the low density one, with similar ratios of growth and dynamical time scales.
Fluctuation growth time is longer than free fall time, and fragmentation seems
unlikely. One then expects the first stars to be massive, not to form binaries
nor harbour planets. Nevertheless, full 3D simulations are required. They could
become possible using simplified estimates of radiative transfer effects, which
we show to work very well in the 1D case. This indicates that the effects of
radiative transfer during the initial stages of formation of primordial
protostars can be treated as local corrections to cooling. (Abridged)

scales non-trivially with the size of the liposome. Closure of the long-lived

behavior of the temperature dependence of the conductance is correlated with
large variations in the differential conductance as a function of the dc

interference of conduction channels corresponding to direct transmission
through the nanotube and resonant transmission through a discrete electron

that two types of screening currents occur within the high-field,

magnetic fields. The first, which gives rise to the induced Hall potential, is
a free current (${\bf j}_{\rm free}$), present at the surface of the sample.
The time constant for the decay of these currents is much longer than that
expected from the sample resistivity. The second component of the current
appears to be magnetic (${\bf j}_{\rm mag}$), in that it is a microscopic,
quasi-orbital effect; it is evenly distributed within the bulk of the sample
upon saturation. To explain these data, we propose a simple model invoking a
new type of quantum fluid comprising a CDW coexisting with a two-dimensional
Fermi-surface pocket which describes the two types of current. The model and

generated apparently contradictory interpretations in terms of the quantum Hall

Relativity (LATOR) mission uses laser interferometry between two
micro-spacecraft whose lines of sight pass close by the Sun to accurately
measure deflection of light in the solar gravity. The key element of the
experimental design is a redundant geometry optical truss provided by a
long-baseline (100 m) multi-channel stellar optical interferometer placed on
the International Space Station (ISS). The spatial interferometer is used for
measuring the angles between the two spacecraft and for orbit determination
purposes. LATOR will not only improve the value of the parameterized
post-Newtonian (PPN) $\gamma$ to unprecedented levels of accuracy of 1 part in
10e8, it will also reach ability to measure effects of the next post-Newtonian
order (1/c^4) of light deflection resulting from gravity's intrinsic
non-linearity. The solar quadrupole moment parameter, J2, will be measured with
high precision, as well as a variety of other relativistic effects including
Lense-Thirring precession. LATOR will lead to very robust advances in the tests
of Fundamental physics: this mission could discover a violation or extension of
general relativity, or reveal the presence of an additional long range
interaction in the physical law. There are no analogs to the LATOR experiment;
it is unique and is a natural culmination of solar system gravity experiments.

models. First there is a discussion of the geometries of one and two
dimensional sigma models, with rigid supersymmetry.
  For the one-dimensional case, the supersymmetry is promoted to a local one
and the required gauge fields are introduced. The most general Lagrangian,
including these gauge fields, is found. The constraints of the system are
analysed, and its Dirac quantisation is investigated.
  In the next chapter we introduce equivariant cohomology which is used later
in the thesis.
  Then actions are constructed for (p,0)- and (p,1)- supersymmetric, $1 \leq p
\leq 4$, two-dimensional gauge theories coupled to non-linear sigma model
matter with a Wess-Zumino term.
  The scalar potential for a large class of these models is derived. It is then
shown that the Euclidean actions of the (2,0) and (4,0)-supersymmetric models
without Wess-Zumino terms are bounded by topological charges which involve the
equivariant extensions of the Kahler forms of the sigma model target spaces
evaluated on the two-dimensional spacetime.
  Similar bounds for Euclidean actions of appropriate gauge theories coupled to
non-linear sigma model matter in higher spacetime dimensions are given which
now involve the equivariant extensions of the Kahler forms of the sigma model
target spaces and the second Chern character of gauge fields. It is found that
the BPS configurations are generalisations of abelian and non-abelian vortices.

new genetic information, which must be integrated into the existing regulatory
network that operates within the cell. General arguments on network control, as
well as several recent genomic observations, indicate that regulatory gene
number grows disproportionally fast with increasing genome size. We present two
models for the growth of regulatory networks. Both predict that the number of
transcriptional regulators will scale quadratically with total gene number.
This appears to be in good quantitative agreement with genomic data from 89
fully sequenced prokaryotes. Moreover, the empirical curve predicts that any
new non-regulatory gene will be accompanied by more than one additional
regulator beyond a genome size of about 20,000 genes, within a factor of two of
the observed ceiling. Our analysis places transcriptional regulatory networks
in the class of accelerating networks. We suggest that prokaryotic complexity
may have been limited throughout evolution by regulatory overhead, and
conversely that complex eukaryotes must have bypassed this constraint by novel
strategies.

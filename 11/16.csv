that the molecular hydrogen abundance exhibits a dramatic increase over a
cosmological time period corresponding to 13% to 24% of the age of the

compared to the general DLA population over the same time baseline. We argue
that this latter point is unsurprising, because the general DLA population
arises in a wide variety of galaxy types and environments, and thus a spans
broad range of ISM gas-phases and abundances at the same cosmic time. DLAs
exhibiting H2 absorption may therefore circumvent this problem, efficiently
identifying a narrower class of objects, and provide a more sensitive probe of
cosmological chemical evolution.

structure of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos. This work confirms the proposal of
Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) that the shape of LambdaCDM halo mass profiles
differs strongly from a power law and is approximately independent of mass. The
logarithmic slope of the spherically-averaged density profile, as measured by
beta=-dln(rho)/dlnr, decreases monotonically towards the center, becomes
shallower than isothermal (beta<2) inside a characteristic radius, r_{-2}, and
shows no evidence for convergence to a well-defined asymptotic value (beta_0)
at the center. The dark mass contained within the innermost radius resolved by
the simulations places strong constraints on beta_0; cusps as steep as r^{-1.5}
are clearly ruled out in our highest resolution simulations. A profile where
the radial dependence of the slope is a simple power law, beta(r)\propto
r^{\alpha}, approximates the structure of halos better than the NFW profile and
so may minimize errors when extrapolating our results inward to radii not yet
reliably probed by numerical simulations. We compare the spherically-averaged
circular velocity (V_c) profiles to the rotation curves of low surface
brightness (LSB) galaxies in the samples of de Blok et al and Swaters et al.
The V_c profiles of simulated CDM halos are generally consistent with the
rotation curves of LSB galaxies, but there are also some clearly discrepant
cases. This disagreement has been interpreted as excluding the presence of
cusps, but it may also just reflect the difference between circular velocity
and rotation speed likely to arise in gaseous disks embedded within realistic
triaxial halos.

X-ray emission from bright limbs, generally interpreted as synchrotron emission
from the loss-steepened tail of the nonthermal electron population also
responsible for radio emission, and thermal emission from elsewhere in the
remnant. In earlier work, we showed that the spatially integrated spectrum was
well described by a theoretical synchrotron model in which shock acceleration
of electrons was limited by escape, in combination with thermal models
indicating high levels of iron from ejecta. Here we use new spatially resolved
subsets of the earlier theoretical nonthermal models for the analysis. We find
that emission from the bright limbs remains well described by those models, and
refine the values for the characteristic break frequency. We show that
differences between the northeast and southwest nonthermal limbs are small, too
small to account easily for the presence of the northeast limb, but not the
southwest, in TeV gamma-rays. Comparison of spectra of the nonthermal limbs and
other regions confirms that simple cylindrically symmetric nonthermal models
cannot describe the emission, and we put limits on nonthermal contributions to
emission from the center and the northwest and southeast limbs. We can rule out
solar-abundance models in all regions, finding evidence for elevated
abundances. However, more sophisticated models will be required to accurately

material on to a condensation, coupled with a nonuniform (exponential)
distribution of accretion lifetimes. This model allows for the generation of
power-law distributions in all star-forming regions, even if condensations
start with a lognormal mass distribution, as may be expected from the central
limit theorem, and supported by some recent numerical simulations of turbulent
molecular clouds. For a condensation mass $m$ with growth rate $dm/dt \propto
m$, an analytic three-parameter probability density function is derived; it
resembles a lognormal at low mass and has a pure power-law high-mass tail. An
approximate power-law tail is also expected for other growth laws, and we
calculate the distribution for the plausible case $dm/dt \propto m^{2/3}$.
Furthermore, any single time snapshot of the masses of condensations that are
still accreting (and are of varying ages) also yields a distribution with a
power-law tail similar to that of the IMF.

nonzero parallel spinors are stable (in the direction of changes in conformal
structures) as the critical points of the total scalar curvature functional. In
fact, we show that the Lichnerowicz Laplacian, which governs the second
variation, is the square of a twisted Dirac operator. Our second result, which
is a local version of the first one, shows that any metrics of positive scalar
curvature cannot lie too close to a metric with nonzero parallel spinor. We
also prove a rigidity result for special holonomy metrics. In the case of
$SU(m)$ holonomy, the rigidity result implies that scalar flat deformations of
Calabi-Yau metric must be Calabi-Yau. Finally we explore the connection with
positive mass theorem, which presents another approach to proving these
stability and rigidity results.

complex coefficients and bounded even degree. We discover that the distribution
function associated to Mahler's measure restricted to monic reciprocal
polynomials is a reciprocal (or anti-reciprocal) Laurent polynomial on
[1,\infty) and identically zero on [0,1). Moreover, the coefficients of this
Laurent polynomial are rational numbers times a power of \pi. We are led to
this discovery by the computation of the Mellin transform of the distribution
function. This Mellin transform is an even (or odd) rational function with
poles at small integers and residues that are rational numbers times a power of
\pi. We also use this Mellin transform to show that the volume of the set of
reciprocal polynomials with complex coefficients, bounded degree and Mahler's
measure less than or equal to one is a rational number times a power of \pi.

the length l_S(x) of x relative to S to be the minimal k such that x is a
product of k elements of S. The supremum of the values l_S(x), x \in G, is
called the width of G with respect to S. Here we focus on a free group F. The
width of F relative to the set of all primitive (respectively palindromic)
elements is called the primitive (respectively palindromic) width of F. We
prove that for a free group F_n of finite rank n, both widths are infinite. A
result of independent interest is that every primitive element of F_2 is a
product of at most two palindromes.

entropy and energy accounting in the Maxwell Demon problem? and (b) How can the
efficiency of markets be measured? Here we show, in a simple model for the
Maxwell Demon, the entropy of the universe increases by an amount
eta=0.839995520 in going from a random state to an ordered state and by an
amount eta*=2.731382 in going from one sorted state to another sorted state. We
calculate the efficiency of an engine driven by the Maxwell sorting process.
The efficiency depends only on the temperatures of the particles and of the
computer the Demon uses to sort the particles. We also show the approach is
general and create a simple model of a stock market in which the Limit Trader
plays the role of the Maxwell Demon. We use this model to define and measure
market efficiency.

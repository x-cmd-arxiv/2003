luminosity L_151 and [OIII] luminosity L_[OIII]: a parameter alpha encoding the
L_151 - L_[OIII] correlation and a parameter beta encoding scatter about this
correlation. We describe methods for constructing generalized luminosity
functions (GLFs) based on alpha, beta, redshift and schemes for unifying
quasars and radio galaxies.
  Luminosity-dependent unified schemes (e.g. a receding-torus scheme) have been
invoked to explain the low quasar to radio galaxy fraction at low alpha and the
differences in emission-line luminosities of radio quasars and radio galaxies.
With the constraints of the 3CRR, 6CE and 7CRS datasets and radio source
counts, our GLF approach was used to determine whether a receding-torus-like
scheme is required if there are two populations of radio sources: one at low
alpha, consisting of 'starved AGN'; the other at high alpha consisting of
'Eddington-tuned AGN'. Because of the overlap between these two populations and
the effects of the beta parameter, schemes with or without a receding torus can
produce a low quasar fraction at low alpha and differences in [OIII] luminosity
between radio galaxies and quasars. The receding torus may be a physical
process important in one or more populations of radio sources, but this is not
yet proved either by the quasar fraction or the emission-line properties of
radio-selected samples.

affected by the illuminating continuum, and therefore a distinct achromatic

for substantial revisions in the picture of cosmic ray transport. In this paper
we use recently obtained scaling laws for MHD modes to calculate the scattering
frequency for cosmic rays in the ISM. We consider gyroresonance with MHD modes
(Alfvenic, slow and fast) and transit-time damping (TTD) by fast modes. We
provide calculations of cosmic ray scattering for various phases of
interstellar medium with realistic interstellar turbulence driving that is
consistent with the velocity dispersions observed in diffuse gas. We account
for the turbulence cutoff arising from both collisional and collisionless
damping. We obtain analytical expressions for diffusion coefficients that enter
Fokker-Planck equation describing cosmic ray evolution. We calculate the
scattering rate and parallel spatial diffusion coefficients of cosmic rays for
both Alfvenic and fast modes. We conclude that fast modes provides the dominant
contribution to cosmic ray scattering for the typical interstellar conditions
in spite of the fact that fast modes are subjected to damping. We show that the
efficiency of the scattering depends on the plasma beta since it determines the
damping of the fast modes. We also show that the streaming instability is
modified in the presence of turbulence.

to identify luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs), so as to allow comparisons
among galaxies and to study environmental effects. The focus of this paper is
on the design of the selection algorithm and on its application to simulated
data. In the companion paper we test it by applying it to sources discovered
through Chandra observations of 4 galaxies. We find that, in its application to
both simulated and real data, our procedure also selects somewhat harder
sources, which we call quasisoft. Whereas values of kT for SSSs are typically
tens of eV, some quasisoft sources (QSSs) may have kT as high as ~250-300 eV.
The dominant spectral component of other QSSs may be as soft as SSS spectra,
but the spectra may also include a low-luminosity harder component. We sketch
physical models for both supersoft and quasisoft sources. Some SSSs are likely
to be accreting white dwarfs; some of these may be progenitors of Type Ia
supernovae. Most QSSs may be too hot to be white dwarfs. They, together with a
subset of SSSs, may be neutron stars or, perhaps most likely, accreting

infalling material is deflected by the field lines towards the equatorial

pseudodisk contracts dynamically in the radial direction, dragging the field
lines threading it into a highly pinched configuration that resembles a split
monopole. The oppositely directed field lines across the midplane and the large
implied stresses may play a role in how magnetic flux is lost in the actual
situation in the presence of finite resistivity or ambipolar diffusion. The
infall rate into the central regions is given to 5% uncertainty by the formula,
$\dot M = (1+H_0)a^3/G$, where $G$ is the universal gravitational constant,
anticipated by semi-analytical studies of the self-similar gravitational
collapses of the singular isothermal sphere and isopedically magnetized disks.

cores, focusing on rotation and magnetic braking during the main accretion
phase of isolated star formation. Motivated by previous numerical work and
analytic considerations, we idealize the pre-collapse core as a magnetized
singular isothermal toroid, with a constant rotational speed everywhere. The
collapse starts from the center, and propagates outwards in an inside-out
fashion, satisfying exact self-similarity in space and time. For rotation rates
and field strengths typical of dense low-mass cores, the main feature remains
the flattening of the mass distribution along field lines -- the formation of a
pseudodisk, as in the nonrotating cases. The density distribution of the
pseudodisk is little affected by rotation. On the other hand, the rotation rate
is strongly modified by pseudodisk formation. Most of the centrally accreted
material reaches the vicinity of the protostar through the pseudodisk. The
specific angular momentum can be greatly reduced on the way, by an order of
magnitude or more, even when the pre-collapse field strength is substantially
below the critical value for dominant cloud support. The efficient magnetic
braking is due to the pinched geometry of the magnetic field in the pseudodisk,
which strengthens the magnetic field and lengthens the level arm for braking.
Both effects enhance the magnetic transport of angular momentum from inside to
outside. The excess angular momentum is carried away in a low-speed outflow
that has, despite claims made by other workers, little in common with observed
bipolar molecular outflows. We discuss the implications of our calculations for
the formation of true disks that are supported against gravity by rotation.

Sigma_5, the surface number density of galaxies determined by the projected
distance to the 5th nearest neighbour; and 2) rho1.1 and rho5.5,
three-dimensional density estimates obtained by convolving the galaxy
distribution with Gaussian kernels of dispersion 1.1 Mpc and 5.5 Mpc,
respectively. We find that star-forming and quiescent galaxies form two
distinct populations, as characterised by their H-alpha equivalent width,
EW(Ha). The relative numbers of star-forming and quiescent galaxies varies
strongly and continuously with local density. However, the distribution of
EW(Ha) amongst the star-forming population is independent of environment. The
fraction of star-forming galaxies shows strong sensitivity to the density on
large scales, rho5.5, which is likely independent of the trend with local
density, rho1.1. We use two differently-selected group catalogues to
demonstrate that the correlation with galaxy density is approximately
independent of group velocity dispersion, for sigma=200-1000 km/s. Even in the
lowest density environments, no more than ~70 per cent of galaxies show
significant H-alpha emission. Based on these results, we conclude that the
present-day correlation between star formation rate and environment is a result
of short-timescale mechanisms that take place preferentially at high redshift,
such as starbursts induced by galaxy-galaxy interactions.

counts expected for different available X-rays cluster samples, namely the

ingredients of the modeling. Therefore number counts provide a robust evidence
of an evolving population. A realistic flat low density model (Omega_M = 0.3),
normalized to the local abundance of clusters is found to overproduce cluster
abundance at high redshift (above z = 0.5) by nearly an order of magnitude.

makes it impossible to derive an accurate value of N(HI) by simply applying a
formula to the observed emission, except in directions where there is very
little interstellar matter. The 21cm line can be used to estimate the
likelihood that there is significant molecular hydrogen in a particular
direction, but carries little or no information on the amount of ionized gas,
which can be a major source of foreground effects. Considerable discussion is
devoted to the importance of small-scale angular structure in HI, with the
conclusion that it will rarely contribute significantly to the total error
compared to other factors (such as the effects of ionized gas) for
extragalactic sight lines at high Galactic latitude. The direction of the
Hubble/Chandra Deep Field North is used as an example of the complexities that
might occur even in the absence of opacity or molecular gas.

supernova remnant. The model uses a hydrodynamics code to simulate the
evolution of this system when the pulsar has a high velocity. The simulation
distinguishes four different stages of pulsar wind nebula evolution: the
supersonic expansion stage, the reverse shock interaction stage, the subsonic
expansion stage and ultimately the bow shock stage. The simulation bears out
that, due to the high velocity of the pulsar, the position of the pulsar is
off-centered with respect to its pulsar wind nebula, after the passage of the
reverse shock. Subsequently the pulsar wind nebula expands subsonically untill
the event of the bow shock formation, when the motion of the pulsar becomes
supersonic. The bow shock formation event occurs at roughly half the crossing
time, when the pulsar is positioned at 0.677 times the radius of the supernova
remnant blastwave, in complete agreement with analytical predictions. The
crossing time is defined by the age of the supernova remnant, when the pulsar
overtakes the blastwave bounding the supernova remnant.
  The results of the model are applied to three supernova remnants: N157B,
G327.1-1.1 and W44. We argue that the head of the pulsar wind nebula,
containing the active pulsar, inside the first two systems are not bounded by a
bow shock. However, in the case of W44 we argue for a scenario in which the
pulsar wind nebula is bounded by a bow shock, due to the supersonic motion of
the pulsar.

Here, we present the first results of our study on X-ray reflection spectra
from such heterogeneous density structures. We consider two cases: first, we
produce a number of toy models where a sharp increase or decrease in density of
variable width is placed at different depths in a uniform slab. Comparing the
resulting reflection spectra to those from an unaltered slab shows that the
inhomogeneity can affect the emission features, in particular the Fe K and O
VIII Lyalpha lines. The magnitude of any differences depends on both the
parameters of the density change and the ionizing power of the illuminating
radiation, but the inhomogeneity is required to be within ~2 Thomson depths of
the surface to cause an effect. However, only relatively small variations in
density (on the order of a few) are necessary for significant changes in the
reflection features to be possible. Our second test was to compute reflection
spectra from the density structure predicted by a simulation of the non-linear
outcome of the photon bubble instability. The resulting spectra also exhibited
differences from the constant density models, caused primarily by a strong 6.7
keV iron line. Nevertheless, constant density models can provide a good fit to
simulated spectra, albeit with a low reflection fraction, between 2 and 10 keV.
Below 2 keV, differences in the predicted soft X-ray line emission result in
very poor fits with a constant density ionized disk model. The results indicate
that density inhomogeneities may further complicate the relationship between
the Fe K equivalent width and the X-ray continuum.

loss. Previous analytical and numerical work shows that this mechanism can
explain cylindrically symmetric nebulae very well. However, many circumstellar

arXiv:condmat/0307554) have shown the existence of two different relaxational
processes (called stimulated and spontaneous) characterizing the relaxation
observed in structural glasses. The existence of these two processes has been
claimed to be at the roots of the intermittency phenomenon observed in recent
experiments. Here we consider a generic system put in contact with a bath at
temperature T and characterized by an adiabatic slow relaxation (i.e. by a
negligible net heat flow from the system to the bath) in the aging state. We
focus on a simplified scenario (termed as partial equilibration) characterized
by the fact that $=0 (where only the spontaneous process is observable) and
whose microscopic stochastic dynamics is ergodic when constrained to the
constant energy surface. Three different effective temperatures can be defined:
a) from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT), b) from a fluctuation
theorem describing the statistical distribution of heat exchange events between
system and bath and c) from a set of observable-dependent microcanonical
relations in the aging state. In a partial equilibration scenario we show how
all three temperatures coincide reinforcing the idea that a statistical (rather
than thermometric) definition of a non-equilibrium temperature is physically
meaningful in aging systems. These results are explicitly checked in a simple

theory, but able to produce van der Waals energies in a natural fashion. The
usual Local Density Approximation (LDA) for the exchange and correlation energy
$E_{xc}$ of an inhomogeneous electronic system can be derived by making a
quasilocal approximation for the {\it interacting} density-density response
function $\chi (\vec{r},\vec{r} ^{\prime},\omega)$, then using the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem and a Feynman coupling-constant integration to
generate $E_{xc}$. The first new idea proposed here is to use the same approach
except that one makes a quasilocal approximation for the {\it bare} response
$\chi ^{0}$, rather than for $\chi $. The interacting response is then obtained
by solving a nonlocal screening integral equation in real space. If the
nonlocal screening is done at the time-dependent Hartree level, then the
resulting energy is an approximation to the full inhomogeneous RPA energy: we
show here that the inhomogeneous RPA correlation energy contains a van der
Waals term for the case of widely-separated neutral subsystems. The second new
idea is to use a particularly simple way of introducing LDA-like local field
corrrections into the screening equations, giving a theory which should remain
reasonable for all separations of a pair of subsystems, encompassing both the
van der Waals limit much as in RPA and the bonding limit much as in LDA theory.

the half-filled repulsive Hubbard model in a uniform magnetic field coupled to

fluctuations is obtained in the hydrodynamic regime. We recover the action of a
Bose superfluid where half the fermion density is identified as the conjugate
variable of the phase of the superconducting order parameter. By integrating
out charge fluctuations, we obtain a phase-only action. In the zero-temperature
superconducting state, this action describes a collective phase mode smoothly
evolving from the Anderson-Bogoliubov mode at weak coupling to the Bogoliubov
mode of a Bose superfluid at strong coupling. At finite temperature, the
phase-only action can be used to extract an effective XY model and thus obtain
the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition temperature. We also
identify a renormalized classical regime of superconducting fluctuations above
the BKT phase transition, and a regime of incoherent pairs at higher
temperature. Special care is devoted to the nearly half-filled case where the
symmetry of the order parameter is enlarged to SO(3) due to strong ${\bf
q}=(\pi,\pi)$ charge fluctuations. The low-energy effective action is then an
SO(3) non-linear sigma model with a (symmetry breaking) magnetic field
proportional to the doping. In the strong-coupling limit, the attractive

broad feature which is spread on the scale of the plasmon energy and vanishes

$\delta$-peaks is the direct consequence of the acoustic nature of the
collective plasmon mode. This behaviour of the spectral function is in the
qualitative agreement with the angle resolved photo-emission spectra of some
Bechgaard salts. In the present work we consider the modifications in the
spectral function due to finite transverse electron dispersion. The transverse
bandwidth is responsible for the appearance of an optical gap in the long
wavelength plasmon mode. The plasmon dispersion of such kind introduces the
quasi-particle $\delta$-peak into the spectral function at the chemical
potential. The cross-over from the Fermi liquid to the non-Fermi liquid regime

  2003",,,,"cs.LO",,"  Suitable extensions of the monadic second-order theory of k successors have
been proposed in the literature to capture the notion of time granularity. In
this paper, we provide the monadic second-order theories of downward unbounded
layered structures, which are infinitely refinable structures consisting of a
coarsest domain and an infinite number of finer and finer domains, and of
upward unbounded layered structures, which consist of a finest domain and an
infinite number of coarser and coarser domains, with expressively complete and
elementarily decidable temporal logic counterparts.
  We obtain such a result in two steps. First, we define a new class of
combined automata, called temporalized automata, which can be proved to be the
automata-theoretic counterpart of temporalized logics, and show that relevant
properties, such as closure under Boolean operations, decidability, and
expressive equivalence with respect to temporal logics, transfer from component
automata to temporalized ones. Then, we exploit the correspondence between
temporalized logics and automata to reduce the task of finding the temporal
logic counterparts of the given theories of time granularity to the easier one
of finding temporalized automata counterparts of them.

study is made of a much larger family of models, which are proposed as type 0A
models of the entire superconformal minimal series coupled to gravity. This
gives many further examples of important physical phenomena, including
non-perturbative descriptions of transitions between D-branes and fluxes,
tachyon condensation, and holography. In particular, features of a large family

extracted which pertain to type 0A string theory, with D-branes and fluxes, in
this large class of backgrounds. For the entire construction to work, large
parts of the spectrum of the supergravitationally dressed superconformal
minimal models and that of the gravitationally dressed bosonic conformal
minimal models must coincide, and it is shown how this happens. The example of

on the space of 3 dimensional conformal field theories with U(1) global
symmetry and a chosen coupling of the symmetry current to a background gauge
field on a 3-fold N. He further argued that, for a class of conformal field
theories, in the nearly Gaussian limit, this SL(2,Z) action may be viewed as a
holographic image of the well-known SL(2,Z) Abelian duality of a pure U(1)
gauge theory on AdS-like 4-folds M bounded by N, as dictated by the AdS/CFT
correspondence. However, he showed that explicitly only for the generator T;
for the generator S, instead, his analysis remained conjectural. In this paper,
we propose a solution of this problem. We derive a general holographic formula
for the nearly Gaussian generating functional of the correlators of the
symmetry current and, using this, we show that Witten's conjecture is indeed
correct when N=S^3. We further identify a class of homology 3-spheres N for
which Witten's conjecture takes a particular simple form.

small number of critical cells for the order complex of any finite poset with

Specifically, if we attach facets according to the lexicographic order on
maximal chains, then each facet contributes at most one new face which is
critical, and at most one Betti number changes; facets which do not change the
homotopy type also do not contribute any critical faces. Dimensions of critical
faces as well as a description of which facet attachments change the homotopy

Geman and Yor in 1993 whose Laplace transform results were in fact regarded as
a noted advance. Unfortunately, a number of difficulties with the key results
of this last contribution have surfaced which are now addressed in this paper.
One of them in particular is of a principal nature and originates with the
Hartman-Watson approach itself: this approach is in general applicable without
modifications only if it does not involve Bessel processes of negative indices.
The main mathematical contribution of this paper is the developement of three
principal ways to overcome these restrictions, in particular by merging
stochastics and complex analysis in what seems a novel way, and the discussion

order in $k_{0}a$ ($k_{0}$ the wavenumber in the host medium, $a$ the radius of
the cylinder), only the first three terms (i.e., of orders 0, -1 and +1) in the
partial wave representation of the scattered field are non-vanishing, and the
material parameters enter into these terms in explicit manner. Moreover, the
zeroth-order term contains only two of the unknown material constants (i.e.,
the real and imaginary parts of complex compressibility of the cylinder
$\kappa_{1}$) whereas the $\pm 1$ order terms contain the other material

the knowledge of the totality of the far-zone scattered field and resulting in

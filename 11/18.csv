  Grains","20 pages, 10 figures, to appear in the proceedings of Astrophysics of
  Dust 2003, Colorado, USA",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Interstellar dust grains exhibit complex dynamics which is essential for
understanding many key interstellar processes that involve dust, including
grain alignment, grain growth, grain shattering etc. Grain rotational and
translational motions are affected not only by gaseous collisions, but also by
interactions with ions, photons, magnetic fields etc. Some of those
interactions, e.g. interactions of ions with the dipole electric moment of dust
grains, require the quantum nature of the process to be accounted for.
Similarly, coupling of rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom in a grain
happens due to relaxation processes, among which the process related to nuclear
spins frequently is the dominant one. This coupling modifies substantially both
the dynamics of rotational and translational motions by inducing grain flips.
The flipping averages our certain systematic torques and forces that act on
grains. As the rate of flipping is larger for smaller grains, these grains can
be ``thermally trapped'', i.e. rotate at a thermal rate in spite of the
presence of systematic torques. Moreover, a subset of small grains with high
dipole moments may rotate at subthermal rates due to high damping arising from
grain emission in microwave range of frequencies. Translational dynamics of
grains is mostly dominated by grain interactions with magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence. Efficient turbulent mixing of dust grains limits the degree to
which grains of different sizes may be segregated in space.

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence call for revisions of some of the
generally accepted concepts. First, MHD turbulence is not so messy as it is
usually believed. In fact, the notion of strong non-linear coupling of
compressible and incompressible motions is not tenable. Alfven, slow and fast
modes of MHD turbulence follow their own cascades and exhibit degrees of
anisotropy consistent with theoretical expectations. Second, the fast decay of
turbulence is not related to the compressibility of fluid. Rates of decay of
compressible and incompressible motions are very similar. Third, viscosity by
neutrals does not suppress MHD turbulence in a partially ionized gas. Instead,
MHD turbulence develops magnetic cascade at scales below the scale at which
neutrals damp ordinary hydrodynamic motions. The implications of those changes
of MHD turbulence paradigm for molecular clouds require further studies. Those
studies can benefit from testing of theoretical predictions using new
statistical techniques that utilize spectroscopic data. We briefly discuss
advances in development of tools using which the statistics of turbulent
velocity can be recovered from observations.

we have analyzed the stability of nonradial oscillations, finding one unstable
mode for pure helium accretion. This is a shallow surface wave which resides in
the helium atmosphere above the heavier ashes of the ocean. It is excited by
the increase in the nuclear reaction rate during the oscillations, and it grows
on the timescale of a second. For a slowly rotating star, this mode has a
frequency of approximately 20-30 Hz (for l=1), and we calculate the full
spectrum that a rapidly rotating (>>30 Hz) neutron star would support. The

the system most likely to show this unstable mode,especially when it is not

they are resonant, that is waves of wavelength comparable to their gyroradii.
These waves may be generated either by the cosmic rays themselves, if they
stream faster than the Alfven speed, or by sources of MHD turbulence. Waves
excited by streaming cosmic rays are ideally shaped for scattering, whereas the
scattering efficiency of MHD turbulence is severely diminished by its
anisotropy. We show that MHD turbulence has an indirect effect on cosmic ray
propagation by acting as a damping mechanism for cosmic ray generated waves.
The hot (``coronal'') phase of the interstellar medium is the best candidate
location for cosmic ray confinement by scattering from self-generated waves. We
relate the streaming velocity of cosmic rays to the rate of turbulent
dissipation in this medium, for the case in which turbulent damping is the
dominant damping mechanism. We conclude that cosmic rays with up to 10^2 GeV
could not stream much faster than the Alfven speed, but that 10^6 GeV cosmic
rays would stream unimpeded by self-generated waves unless the coronal gas were
remarkably turbulence-free.

The cluster emission-weighted mean temperature is 11.8+/-0.6kev, somewhat
higher than previous temperature measurements. The Chandra temperature map of
A2319 reveals substructure resembling that anticipated based on hydrodynamic

In this paper, assuming that each central BH in nearby galaxies has experienced
the QSO phase and ignoring BH mergers, we establish a relation between the QSO
luminosity function (LF) and the local BH mass function (MF). The QSOLF is
jointly controlled by the luminosity evolution of individual QSOs and the
triggering history of the accretion onto seed BHs. By comparing the time
integral of the QSOLF with that inferred from local BHs, we separate the effect
of the luminosity evolution of individual QSOs from the effect of the
triggering history. Assuming that the nuclear luminosity evolution includes two
phases (first increasing at the Eddington luminosity with growth of BHs and
then declining), we find that observations are generally consistent with the
expected relation between the QSOLF and the local BHMF and obtain the
constraints on QSO models and BH growth. We point out that it is hard to
accurately estimate the value of the QSO lifetime from the QSOLF and/or the
local BHMF, if it is longer than a certain value (e.g., four times of the
Salpeter timescale in this study). We discuss the importance of accurate
measurements of the intrinsic scatter in the BH mass and velocity dispersion
relation of local galaxies and the scatter in the bolometric correction of
QSOs. We also discuss some possible applications of the work in this paper,

dispersion relation in local galaxies, through the nuclear luminosity evolution
of individual QSOs/AGNs and the mass growth of individual BHs. In the study we
ignore the effects of BH mergers and assume that the velocity dispersion does
not change significantly during and after the nuclear activity phase. Using the
observed correlation in local galaxies and an assumed form of the QSO/AGN
luminosity evolution and BH growth, we obtain the simulated observational
appearance of the BH mass versus velocity dispersion relation in QSOs/AGNs. The
simulation results illustrate how the BH accretion history (e.g., the lifetime
of nuclear activity and the possibility that QSOs/AGNs accrete at a
super-Eddington accretion rate at the early evolutionary stage) can be inferred
from the difference between the relation in QSOs/AGNs and that in local

predominantly thermal, heavily absorbed and can be best described by an NEI
(nonequilibrium ionization) model with a temperature around 0.9keV, and an
ionization timescale of 1.1x10^10 /cm3/s. We find only marginal evidence for
non-solar abundances. Comparisons between 21 cm HI absorption data and derived
parameters from our spectral analysis strongly suggest a relatively near-by
remnant (a distance of about 2kpc). Above 4keV, we identify a small region of
emission located at the tip of the central, flat spectrum bar-like feature in
the radio image. We examine two possibilities for this emission region: a
temperature variation within the remnant or a pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The
current data do not allow us to distinguish between these possible
explanations. In the scenario where this high-energy emission region
corresponds to a PWN, our analysis suggests a rotational loss rate for the
unseen pulsar of about 7x10^35 erg/s and a ratio Lr/Lx about 3.6 for the entire
PWN, slightly above the maximum ratio (3.4 for Vela) measured in known PWN.

stars by holding up the subcritical envelope of a molecular cloud that suffers
gravitational collapse of its supercritical core. We perform an equilibrium
analysis of the initial and final states assuming perfect field freezing, no
rotation, isothermality, and a completely flattened configuration. The sheet
geometry allows us to separate the magnetic tension into a levitation
associated with the split monopole formed by the trapped flux of the central
star and a suspension associated with curved field lines that thread the static
pseudodisk and envelope of material external to the star. We find solutions
where the eigenvalue for the stellar mass is a fixed multiple of the initial
core mass of the cloud. We verify the analytically derived result by an
explicit numerical simulation of a closely related 3-D axisymmetric system.
However, with field freezing, the implied surface magnetic fields much exceed
measured values for young stars. If the pinch by the central split monopole
were to be eliminated by magnetic reconnection, then magnetic suspension alone
cannot keep the subcritical envelope (i.e., the entire model cloud) from
falling onto the star. We argue that this answer has general validity, even if
the initial state lacked any kind of symmetry, possessed rotation, and had a
substantial level of turbulence. These findings strongly support a picture for
the halt of infall that invokes dynamic levitation by YSO winds and jets, but
the breakdown of ideal magnetohydrodynamics is required to allow the appearance
in the problem of a rapidly rotating, centrifugally supported disk. We use
these results to calculate the initial mass function and star formation
efficiency for the distributed and clustered modes of star formation.

with their virial masses. A size - velocity dispersion relation is also plotted
on an extension of the relation for the Galactic GMCs. These facts suggest that
the properties of these clouds are similar to that of the Galactic GMCs. We
also found no clear systematic offset between the molecular gas and HII regions

in grand design spiral galaxies, such as M 51, GMA formations may occur only in

result is that the majority of the Hickson Compact Group galaxies lie on the
T-F relation. However, about 20% of the galaxies, including the lowest-mass
systems, have higher B luminosities for a given mass, or alternatively, a mass
which is too low for their luminosities. We favour a scenario in which outliers
have been brightened due to either enhanced star formation or merging.
Alternatively, the T-F outliers may have undergone truncation of their dark
halo due to interactions. It is possible that in some cases, both effects
contribute. The fact that the B-band T-F relation is similar for compact group
and field galaxies tells us that these galaxies show common mass-to-size
relations and that the halos of compact group galaxies have not been
significantly stripped inside R25. We find that 75% of the compact group
galaxies studied (22 out of 29) have highly peculiar velocity fields.
Nevertheless, a careful choice of inclination, position angle and center,
obtained from the velocity field, and an average of the velocities over a large
sector of the galaxy enabled the determination of fairly well-behaved rotation
curves for the galaxies. However, two of the compact group galaxies which are
the most massive members in M51--like pairs, HCG 91a and HCG 96a, have very

dimensionality dependence is weak, and show that for $d=1$, $D \sim

  fields: spin and orbital mechanisms","12 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.69.125113",,"cond-mat.str-el",,"  The charge density wave (CDW) transition temperature in the quasi-one
dimensional (Q1D) organic material of (Per)$_2$Au(mnt)$_2$ is relatively low
(TCDW = 12 K). Hence in a mean field BCS model, the CDW state should be
completely suppressed in magnetic fields of order 30 - 40 T. To explore this
possibility, the magnetoresistance of (Per)$_2$Au(mnt)$_2$ was investigated in
magnetic fields to 45 T for 0.5 K < T < 12 K. For fields directed along the Q1D
molecular stacking direction, TCDW decreases with field, terminating at about ~
37 T for temperatures approaching zero. Results for this field orientation are
in general agreement with theoretical predictions, including the field
dependence of the magnetoresistance and the energy gap, $\Delta_{CDW}$.
However, for fields tilted away from the stacking direction, orbital effects
arise above 15 T that may be related to the return of un-nested Fermi surface
sections that develop as the CDW state is suppressed. These findings are
consistent with expectations that quasi-one dimensional metallic behavior will
return outside the CDW phase boundary.

second-order Beliaev-Popov approach by allowing for the dynamical coupling
between fluctuations in the thermal cloud, and ({\it ii}) reduces to an earlier

combined normal and anomalous density fluctuations play an important role in

to yield accurate results for the quadrupolar modes of the condensate. Although
the restriction to spherical confinement prevents quantitative comparisons with

point masses in harmonic coordinates. At the third post-Newtonian (3PN)
approximation, it is found that the dimensionally regularized equations of
motion contain a pole part [proportional to 1/(d-3)] which diverges as the
space dimension d tends to 3. It is proven that the pole part can be
renormalized away by introducing suitable shifts of the two world-lines
representing the point masses, and that the same shifts renormalize away the
pole part of the ""bulk"" metric tensor g_munu(x). The ensuing, finite
renormalized equations of motion are then found to belong to the general
parametric equations of motion derived by an extended Hadamard regularization
method, and to uniquely determine the heretofore unknown 3PN parameter lambda
to be: lambda = - 1987/3080. This value is fully consistent with the recent
determination of the equivalent 3PN static ambiguity parameter, omega_s = 0, by
a dimensional-regularization derivation of the Hamiltonian in
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner coordinates. Our work provides a new, powerful check of
the consistency of the dimensional regularization method within the context of
the classical gravitational interaction of point particles.

point of view, based on a 3+1 splitting of Minkowski space-time with a
foliation whose space-like leaves are both simultaneity and Cauchy surfaces,
allows to find a solution to such problems, if we take into account M$\o$ller's
definition of allowed 4-coordinate transformations extended to radar
4-coordinates. Rigidly rotating relativistic reference frames are shown not to
exist. We give explicit foliations, with simultaneity surfaces (also space-like
hyper-planes) non orthogonal to the non-inertial observer world-line, which
correspond to a good notion of simultaneity for suitable (mutually balancing)
translational and rotational accelerations. This allows to evaluate the
simultaneity-dependent one-way speed of light and to give the 3+1 description
of both the rotating disk and the Sagnac effect. It is also shown how a GPS
system of spacecrafts may establish a grid of admissible radar 4-coordinates
and how the ACES mission can employ a variant of this method adapted to Earth's
rotation in the evaluation of the one-way time transfer to detect the deviation
from Einstein convention on the synchronization of inertial clocks implied by
such a notion of simultaneity. We show that in parametrized Minkowski theories
all the admissible notions of simultaneity are gauge equivalent ({\it
conventionality of simultaneity}) and, as an example, we describe Maxwell

momentum are eigenstates of a {\it kinematic} angular momentum operator and
satisfy all Lorentz symmetries. They are analytic functions of the invariant
mass squared of the constituents $M^2_0= (\sum k^\mu)^2$ and the light-cone
momentum fractions $x_i= {k_i\cd \omega / p \cd \omega}$ multiplied by
invariants constructed from the spin matrices, polarization vectors, and

Chung and Coester to describe static and low momentum properties of the
nucleons. They correspond to the spin-locking of a quark with the spin of its
parent nucleon, together with a positive-energy projection constraint. These
extra constraints lead to anomalous dependence of form factors on $Q$ rather
than $Q^2.$ In contrast, the dependence of LFWFs on $M^2_0$ implies that hadron
form factors are analytic functions of $Q^2$ in agreement with dispersion

being sensitive to hadronization dynamics, since the production length is
comparable with the nuclear size. This was the driving motivation to propose
measurements at HERMES using nuclear targets, and to provide predictions based
on a pQCD model of hadronization [1]. Now when the first results of the
experiment are released [2,3], one can compare the predictions with the data.
The model successfully describes with no adjustment the nuclear effects for
various energies, zh, pT, and Q2, for different flavors and different nuclei.
It turns out that the main source of nuclear suppression of the hadron
production rate is attenuation of colorless pre-hadrons in the medium. An
alternative model [4] is based upon an ad hoc assumption that the colorless
pre-hadron is produced outside the nucleus. This model has apparent problems
attempting to explain certain features of the results from HERMES. A good
understanding of the hadronization dynamics is important for proper
interpretation of the strong suppression of high-pT hadrons observed in heavy
ion collisions at RHIC. We demonstrate that the production length is even
shorter in this case and keeps contracting with rising pT.

1+1 space-time dimensions which contain unstable particles in their spectrum.
Recalling first the main features of analytic scattering theories associated to
integrable models, we subsequently propose a new bootstrap principle which
allows for the construction of particle spectra involving unstable as well as
stable particles. We describe the general Lie algebraic structure which
underlies theories with unstable particles and formulate a decoupling rule,
which predicts the renormalization group flow in dependence of the relative
ordering of the resonance parameters. We extend these ideas to theories with an
infinite spectrum of unstable particles. We provide new expressions for the
scattering amplitudes in the soliton-antisoliton sector of the elliptic
sine-Gordon model in terms of infinite products of q-deformed gamma functions.
When relaxing the usual restriction on the coupling constants, the model
contains additional bound states which admit an interpretation as breathers.
For that situation we compute the complete S-matrix of all sectors. We carry
out various reductions of the model, one of them leading to a new type of
theory, namely an elliptic version of the minimal SO(n)-affine Toda field
theory.

fluctuations give an energy density $\sim m_{susy}^2m_{Pl}^2$, but the universe
quickly cascades to an energy density $\sim m_{susy}^2m_{Pl}^2/N$. Then at
various phase transitions there are large contributions to the energy density
and rearrangement of levels, followed again by a rapid cascade to the ground
state or near it. If this mechanism is correct, the ground state of the theory
describing our world would be a superposition of a large number of connected

from molecular dynamics for a liquid with a liquid-gas or liquid-solid
interface. The standard method used in bulk fluids, based on computing the mean
square displacement as a function of time and extracting the asymptotic linear
time dependence from this, is not valid for systems with interfaces or for
confined fluids. The method proposed here is based on imposing virtual boundary
conditions on the molecular system and computing survival probabilities and
specified time correlation functions in different layers of the fluid up to and
including the interfacial layer. By running dual simulations, one based on MD
and the other based on Langevin dynamics, using the same boundary conditions,
one can fit the Langevin survival probability at long times to the MD computed
survival probability, thereby determining the diffusion coefficient as a
function of distance of the layers from the interface. We compute the elements
of the diffusion tensor of water as a function of distance from the liquid
vapor interface of water. Far from the interface the diffusion tensor is found
to be isotropic, as expected, and the diffusion coefficient has the value
$D\approx$ .22\AA$^2$/psec in agreement with what is found in the bulk liquid.
In the interfacial region the diffusion tensor is axially anisotropic, with
values of $D_{\parallel}\approx$. 8\AA$^2$/psec and $D_{\perp}\approx$.
5\AA$^2$/psec for the components parallel and normal the interface surface
respectively. We also show that diffusion in confined geometries can be
calculated by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the molecular system

operator corresponding to the same boundary conditions.

To appear in Multiscale Modeling and Simulation",,,,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  This paper extends the derivation of the Lagrangian averaged Euler
(LAE-$\alpha$) equations to the case of barotropic compressible flows. The aim
of Lagrangian averaging is to regularize the compressible Euler equations by
adding dispersion instead of artificial viscosity. Along the way, the
derivation of the isotropic and anisotropic LAE-$\alpha$ equations is
simplified and clarified.
  The derivation in this paper involves averaging over a tube of trajectories
$\eta^\epsilon$ centered around a given Lagrangian flow $\eta$. With this tube
framework, the Lagrangian averaged Euler (LAE-$\alpha$) equations are derived
by following a simple procedure: start with a given action, Taylor expand in
terms of small-scale fluid fluctuations $\xi$, truncate, average, and then
model those terms that are nonlinear functions of $\xi$. Closure of the
equations is provided through the use of \emph{flow rules}, which prescribe the
evolution of the fluctuations along the mean flow.

substrates such as DNA in response to environmental signals such as the
simultaneous binding to a small molecule. Examples are repressor proteins which
may transmit information via a conformational change in response to the ligand
binding. An alternative entropic mechanism of ``allostery'' suggests that the
inducer ligand changes the intramolecular vibrational entropy not just the
static structure. We present a quantitative, coarse-grained model of entropic
allostery that suggests design rules for internal cohesive potentials in
proteins employing this effect. It also addresses the issue of how the signal
information to bind or unbind is transmitted through the protein. The model may
be applicable to a wide range of repressors and also to signalling in
transmembrane proteins.

efficient and robust resource for key distribution. Such codes are sets of
states that are as evenly spaced throughout the vector space as possible. In
the case the two parties use qubits and face the intercept/resend eavesdropping

and momentum to be added to the classical motion. Extending into the
relativistic regime for spinless particles, this procedure leads also to a
derivation of the Klein-Gordon equation. Comparing classical Hamiltonian flow
with quantum theory, then, the essential difference is given by a vanishing
divergence of the velocity of the probability current in the former, whereas
the latter results from a much less stringent requirement, i.e., that only the
average over fluctuations and positions of the average divergence be identical
to zero.

striking different from other types of quantum walks. The present paper
explains the reason why the walker who moves according to the degree-four
Grover's operator can remain at the starting point with a high probability. It
is shown that the key factor for the localization is due to the degeneration of
eigenvalues of the time evolution operator. In fact, the global time evolution
of the quantum walk on a large lattice is mainly determined by the degree of
degeneration. The dependence of the localization on the initial state is also
considered by calculating the wave function analytically.

to centre the initial velocity distribution of the cloud at an arbitrary point

place the initial velocity distribution in a region of phase-space not
accessible to previous experiments, namely beyond the momentum boundaries
arising from the finite pulse duration of the potential. We further use the

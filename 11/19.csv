as gravitational lenses for the CMB photons. This lensing deforms the angular
distribution of the CMB maps in such a way that the induced deformations are

used in this paper, matter is evolved with a particle-mesh N-body code and,
then, an useful ray-tracing technique designed to calculate the correlations of
the lens deformations induced by nonlinear structures is applied. Our approach
is described in detail and tested. Various correlations are estimated at an
appropriate angular scale. The resulting values point out both deviations with

relationship between rms amplitude and flux, implying a multiplying-together or
`coupling' of variability on different time-scales. Such a coupling may result
from avalanches of flares, due to magnetic reconnection in an X-ray emitting
corona. Alternatively this coupling may arise directly from the coupling of
perturbations in the accretion flow, which propagate to the inner emitting
regions and so modulate the X-ray emission. Here, we demonstrate explicitly
that the component of aperiodic variability which carries the rms-flux relation

formation is caused by the quasi-classical quantization of the one- and

result in the instabilities with respect to spontaneous formation of an

become localized (a transition of the metal-insulator type). In the

Junctions with different barrier thickness d_N, showed that the distance
between adjacent peaks scales inversely with d_N. The peaks were thus
identified as due to McMillan-Rowell like oscillations in the barrier. Analysis
of the series of peaks yields an upper limit of about 3.7 meV on the value of
the energy gap along the node. We attribute this small gap to the complex s

allows to establish a quantitative distinction between central and peripheral
collisions in pbar-p and p-p collisions at Tevatron and LHC energies. Such a
trigger strongly reduces the effective impact parameters as compared to minimum
bias events. This happens because the transverse spatial distribution of hard
partons (x >~ 10^{-2}) in the proton is considerably narrower than that of soft
partons, whose collisions dominate the total cross section. In the central
collisions selected by the trigger, most of the partons with x >~ 10^{-2}
interact with a gluon field whose strength rapidly increases with energy. At
LHC (and to some extent already at Tevatron) energies the strength of this
interaction approaches the unitarity ('black-body') limit. This leads to
specific modifications of the final state, such as a higher probability of
multijet events at small rapidities, a strong increase of the transverse
momenta and depletion of the longitudinal momenta at large rapidities, and the
appearance of long-range correlations in rapidity between the forward/backward
fragmentation regions. The same pattern is expected for events with production
of new heavy particles (Higgs, SUSY). Studies of these phenomena would be
feasible with the CMS-TOTEM detector setup, and would have considerable impact
on the exploration of the physics of strong gluon fields in QCD, as well as the
search for new particles at LHC.

an example of these effects we develop a particle physics motivated model which
we recently introduced in which the D-flat direction is identified with the

correct curvature perturbations for initial values of the curvaton fields of
order the weak scale. In this model we show that the prediction for the

relation, which is valid for any arbitrary number of oscillators, displays
important differences from similar relations obtained from continuum models. We
discuss the general characteristics of the equilibrium states including their
dependencies on various system parameters. We next carry out a detailed linear
stability investigation of these states in order to delineate their actual
existence regions and to determine their parametric dependence on time delay.
Time delay is found to expand the range of possible phaselocked patterns and to
contribute favorably toward their stability. The amplitude death state is
studied in the parameter space of time delay and coupling strength. It is shown
that death island regions can exist for any number of oscillators N in the

its original scope, as a rule to assign a probability distribution, to a
full-fledged method for inductive inference. The main concept is the (relative)
entropy S[p|q] which is designed as a tool to update from a prior probability
distribution q to a posterior probability distribution p when new information
in the form of a constraint becomes available. The extended method goes beyond
the mere selection of a single posterior p, but also addresses the question of
how much less probable other distributions might be. Our approach clarifies how
the entropy S[p|q] is used while avoiding the question of its meaning.
Ultimately, entropy is a tool for induction which needs no interpretation.
Finally, being a tool for generalization from special examples, we ask whether
the functional form of the entropy depends on the choice of the examples and we
find that it does. The conclusion is that there is no single general theory of
inductive inference and that alternative expressions for the entropy are
possible.

examine the relationship between ecological and evolutionary dynamics, focusing
on a well-studied experimental aquatic predator-prey system (Fussmann et al.
2000; Shertzer et al. 2002; Yoshida et al. 2003). Major properties of
predator-prey cycles in this system are determined by ongoing evolutionary
dynamics in the prey population. Under some conditions, however, the
populations tend to apparently stable steady-state densities. These are the
subject of the present paper. We examine a previously developed model for the
system, to determine how evolution shapes properties of the equilibria, in
particular the number and identity of coexisting prey genotypes. We then apply
these results to explore how evolutionary dynamics can shape the responses of
the system to ""management"": externally imposed alterations in conditions.
Specifically, we compare the behavior of the system including evolutionary
dynamics, with predictions that would be made if the potential for rapid
evolutionary change is negelected. Finally, we posit some simple experiments to
verify our prediction that evolution can have significant qualitative effects
on observed population-level responses to changing conditions.

on this question is crucial, in particular, for consideration of brain neurons

arguments. In present paper nonlinear statistical properties of the Ventral
Tegmental Area (VTA) of genetically depressive limbic brain are studied {\it in
vivo} on the Flinders Sensitive Line of rats (FSL). VTA plays a key role in
generation of pleasure and in development of psychological drug addiction. We
found that the FSL VTA (dopaminergic) neuron signals exhibit multifractal
properties for interspike frequencies on the scales where healthy VTA
dopaminergic neurons exhibit bursting activity. For high moments the observed
multifractal (generalized dimensions) spectrum coincides with the generalized
dimensions spectrum calculated for a spectral measure of a {\it quantum} system
(so-called kicked Harper model, actively used as a model of quantum chaos).
This observation can be considered as a first experimental ({\it in vivo})

  Quantum contextuality","10 pages, 3 figures. for the proceedings of CEWQO10 workshop",,"10.1088/1464-4266/6/3/002",,"quant-ph",,"  We report a single-neutron optical experiment to demonstrate the violation of
a Bell-like inequality. Entanglement is achieved not between particles, but
between the degrees of freedom, in this case, for a single-particle. The
spin-{\small 1/2} property of neutrons are utilized. The total wave function of
the neutron is described in a tensor product Hilbert space. A Bell-like
inequality is derived not by a non-locality but by a contextuality. Joint
measurements of the spinor and the path properties lead to the violation of a
Bell-like inequality. Manipulation of the wavefunction in one Hilbert space
influences the result of the measurement in the other Hilbert space. A
discussion is given on the quantum contextuality and an entanglement-induced
correlation in our experiment.

simultaneous multi-axis spatial displacement measurements that have zero mean

with exotic transverse mode profiles. We show that, in principle, lossless
combination of these modes can be achieved using the non-degenerate Gouy phase
shift of optical resonators. When the combined squeezed beams are measured with
quadrant detectors, we experimentally demonstrate a simultaneous reduction in
the transverse x- and y- displacement fluctuations of 2.2 dB and 3.1 dB below
the quantum noise limit.

in phase locking between these two beams. As in a classical OPO, the signal and
idler waves show large quantum correlations which can be measured
experimentally due to the phase locking between the two beams. We study the
influence of the waveplate on the various criteria characterizing quantum
correlations. We show in particular that the quantum correlations can be
maximized by using optimized quadratures.

"quant-ph/0311124","Valentin Oleinik Petrovich","V.P. Oleinik","The Helmholtz Theorem and Superluminal Signals","5 pages,no figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The conventional decomposition of a vector field into longitudinal
(potential) and transverse (vortex) components (Helmholtz's theorem) is claimed
in [1] to be inapplicable to the time-dependent vector fields and, in
particular, to the retarded solutions of Maxwell's equations. Because of this,
according to [1], a number of conclusions drawn in [2] on the basis of the
Helmholtz theorem turns out to be erroneous. The Helmholtz theorem is proved in
this letter to hold for arbitrary vector field, both static and time-dependent.
Therefore, the conclusions of the paper [2] questioned in [1] are true. The
validity of Helmholtz's theorem in the general case is due to the fact that the
decomposition above of vector field does not influence the field time
coordinate, which plays, thus, a passive role in the decomposition procedure.
An analysis is given of the mistakes made in [1]. It is noted that for point
particle the longitudinal and transverse components of electric field, taken
separately, are characterized by the infinitely great velocity of propagation.
However, superluminal contributions to the expression for the total electric
field cancel each other.

protoplanetary cores in a gaseous nebula. Gas drag strongly affects the motion
of small bodies leading to the decay of their eccentricities and inclinations,
which are excited by the gravity of protoplanetary cores. Drag acting on larger
($\gtrsim 1$ km), high velocity planetesimals causes a mere reduction of their
average random velocity. By contrast, drag qualitatively changes the dynamics
of smaller ($\lesssim 0.1-1$ km), low velocity objects: (1) small planetesimals
sediment towards the midplane of the nebula forming vertically thin subdisk;
(2) their random velocities rapidly decay between successive passages of the
cores and, as a result, encounters with cores typically occur at the minimum
relative velocity allowed by the shear in the disk. This leads to a drastic
increase in the accretion rate of small planetesimals by the protoplanetary
cores, allowing cores to grow faster than expected in the simple oligarchic
picture, provided that the population of small planetesimals contains more than
roughly 1% of the solid mass in the nebula. Fragmentation of larger
planetesimals ($\gtrsim 1$ km) in energetic collisions triggered by the
gravitational scattering by cores can easily channel this amount of material
into small bodies on reasonable timescales ($< 1$ Myr in the outer Solar
System), providing a means for the rapid growth (within several Myr at 30 AU)
of rather massive protoplanetary cores. Effects of inelastic collisions between
planetesimals and presence of multiple protoplanetary cores are discussed.

of sources detected were of class 0 status. We detected a higher fraction of
class 0 sources compared with the class I and II sources, although given the
small numbers involved the significance of this result should be regarded as
tentative. Most of the detected sources showed emission either at or close to

higher-density region than the methanol previously observed. We find that the
most likely explanation for the preferential detection of SiO emission towards

that the dark matter in the halos of dSphs is composed of massive black holes

simulations to determine the long term evolution of a two-component dSph
composed of a pressure-supported stellar population in a black hole halo. The
black holes are initially distributed according to a Navarro, Frenk & White
profile. For black hole masses between 10^5 and 10^6 solar masses, the dark
matter halo evolves towards a shallower inner profile in less than a Hubble
time. This suggests that black holes in this mass range might provide an
explanation for the origin of the dark matter cores inferred from observations
of Low Surface Brightness galaxy rotation curves. We compare the simulated
evolution of the stellar population with observed data for the Draco dSph. The
dependence of the heating rate on the black hole mass is determined, and an
upper limit of 10^5 solar masses is placed on the individual black holes
comprising the dark matter halo of Draco, if its present stellar distribution
is representative of the initial one. We also present a simple scaling argument
which demonstrates that the dynamical heating of an initially compact, though

similar in extent to Draco after 10 Gyr, even for black hole masses somewhat in

photometric system has been derived from MARCS model atmospheres and SSG
synthetic spectra for cool dwarf and giant stars. At warmer temperatures this
grid has been supplemented with the synthetic uvby colors from recent Kurucz
atmospheric models without overshooting. Our transformations appear to
reproduce the observed colors of extremely metal-poor turnoff and giant stars
(i.e., [Fe/H]<-2). Due to a number of assumptions made in the synthetic color
calculations, however, our color-temperature relations for cool stars fail to
provide a suitable match to the uvby photometry of both cluster and field stars
having [Fe/H]>-2. To overcome this problem, the theoretical indices at
intermediate and high metallicities have been corrected using a set of color
calibrations based on field stars having accurate IRFM temperature estimates
and spectroscopic [Fe/H] values. Encouragingly, isochrones that employ the
transformations derived in this study are able to reproduce the observed CMDs
(involving u-v, v-b, and b-y colors) for a number of open and globular clusters
(including M92, M67, the Hyades, and 47Tuc) rather well. Moreover, our

subdwarfs, compared our ""final"" (b-y)-Teff relationship with those derived

sized dark matter halo in the CDM cosmogony in general consists of an early
fast collapse phase, during which the potential associated with a halo is
established, followed by a slow accretion phase, during which mass is added
rather gently in the outer region. Here we outline a scenario in which the fast
collapse phase is accompanied with rapid formation of cold clouds and with
starbursts that can eject a large amount of gas from the halo center.The loss
of orbital energy of the cold clouds to the dark matter and the ejection of gas
from halo center by starburst can significantly reduce the halo concentration.
The outflow from the starburst can also heat the gas in the protogalaxy region.
Subsequent formation of galaxies in the slow accretion regime is therefore in
halos that have been pre-processed by these processes and may have properties
different from that given by N-body simulations.
  This scenario can help to solve several outstanding problems in the standard
  Lambda CDM model of galaxy formation without compromising its success in
allowing structure formation at high redshift. The predicted rotation curves
are quite flat,alleviating the discrepancy of the Tully-Fisher relation
predicted in the Lambda CDM model with observations. The flattened galaxy halos
allow accreted minihalos to survive in their central regions longer, which may
be helpful in producing the flux anomalies observed in some gravitational
lensing systems. The preheating by the early starbursts effectively reduces the
amount of gas that can be accreted into galaxy halos, which may explain why the
baryon fraction in a spiral galaxy is in general much lower than the universal
baryon fraction, f_B~0.16, in the standard Lambda CDM model.

statistics on the faint, filamentary, diffuse X-ray emission. The true-color
X-ray image and the equivalent width (EW) images for the detected elemental
species demonstrate that the diffuse X-ray features have a broad range of
spatio-spectral properties. Enhancements of the low-ionization-state, or
``neutral'' Fe line emission (E~6.4 keV) to the northeast of Sgr A* can be
interpreted as fluorescence within the dense ISM resulting from irradiation by
hard, external X-ray sources. They may also be explained by emission induced by
the bombardments by high energy particles on the ISM, such as unresolved
supernova (SN) ejecta intruding into dense ISM. The detection of molecular
cloud counterparts to the 6.4 keV Fe line features indicates that these Fe line
features are associated with dense GC clouds and/or active star-forming
regions, which supports the X-ray reflection and/or SN ejecta origins for the
Fe line emission. We detect highly ionized S and Si lines which are generally
coincident with the neutral Fe line emission and the dense molecular clouds in
the northeast of Sgr A*. These hot plasmas are likely produced by massive
star-forming activities and/or SNRs. In contrast, we find that highly ionized
He-like Fe line emission (E~6.7 keV) is primarily distributed along the plane
instead of being concentrated in the northeast of Sgr A*. The implied high
temperature and the alignment along the plane are consistent with the magnetic
confinement model.

scale L in molecular clouds can be measured from size-linewidth relations,
principal component analysis, or line centroid variation. Differing values of
the power law index of the scaling relation dv = L^(g3D) in 3D are given by
these different methods: the first two give g3D=0.5, while line centroid
analysis gives g3D=0. This discrepancy has previously not been fully
appreciated, as the variation of projected velocity line centroid fluctuations
(dv_{lc} = L^(g2D)) is indeed described, in 2D, by g2D=0.5. However, if
projection smoothing is accounted for, this implies that g3D=0. We suggest that
a resolution of this discrepancy can be achieved by accounting for the effect
of density inhomogeneity on the observed g2D obtained from velocity line
centroid analysis. Numerical simulations of compressible turbulence are used to
show that the effect of density inhomogeneity statistically reverses the effect
of projection smoothing in the case of driven turbulence so that velocity line
centroid analysis does indeed predict that g2D=g3D=0.5. Using our numerical
results we can restore consistency between line centroid analysis, principal
component analysis and size-linewidth relations, and we derive g3D=0.5,
corresponding to shock-dominated (Burgers) turbulence. We find that this
consistency requires that molecular clouds are continually driven on large
scales or are only recently formed.

gamma-ray burst (GRBs) -- rotating naked helium stars presumed to have lost
their envelopes to winds or companions. Our aim is to investigate the formation
and development of single and binary systems and from this population evaluate
the rates of interesting individual species. Using a rapid binary evolution
algorithm, that enables us to model the most complex binary systems and to
explore the effect of metallicity on GRB production, we draw the following
conclusions. First we find that, if we include an approximate treatment of
angular momentum transport by mass loss, the resulting spin rates for single
stars become too low to form a centrifugally supported disc that can drive a
GRB engine. Second massive stars in binaries result in enough angular momentum
-- due to spin-orbit tidal interactions -- to form a centrifugally supported
disc and are thus capable of supplying a sufficient number of progenitors. This
holds true even if only a small fraction of bursts are visible to a given
observer and the GRB rate is several hundred times larger than the observed
rate. Third low-metallicity stars aid the formation of a rapidly rotating,
massive helium cores at collapse and so their evolution is likely to be
affected by the local properties of the ISM. This effect could increase the GRB
formation rate by a factor of 5-7 at Z=Z_solar/200. Finally we quantify the
effects of mass loss, common-envelope evolution and black-hole formation and
show that more stringent constraints to many of these evolution parameters are

matter on the spin evolution of isolated neutron stars is studied for a broad
set of hyperonic EOSs. We use a multidomain 2-D code based on a spectral
method, and show how important the precision of solving the equations of
stationary motion is for the stability analysis. For some EOSs, the hyperon
softening leads to spin-up by the angular momentum loss, in the form of the
back bending phenomenon, for a rather broad range of stellar baryon mass. We
show that large segments of the evolutionary tracks exhibiting the back bending
behaviour in the moment-of-inertia - rotation-frequency plane, are actually
unstable and therefore not astrophysically relevant. We show also that during
the spin-up - angular-momentum-loss epoch, an isolated neutron star (e.g., a
radio pulsar) can lose a sizable part of its initial angular momentum without
significantly changing its rotation period. We propose also simple arguments
and criteria allowing to connect the presence of a back bending epoch with the
mass-radius relations and the stiffness and/or softness of the nucleon and
hyperon EOSs of the neutron star core.

  Billions of galaxies produced in the big bang will also be shuttling within
the closed universe, passing the central part of the universe again and again.
They have many chances to meet each other. There are numerous black holes of
various sizes in these galaxies. A black hole absorbs matter and radiation,
even swallows in other approaching celestial bodies. These black holes provide
the mechanism of matter-re-gathering and energy-re-gathering in the universe.
All the real matter will finally gather again to form a single huge black hole.
The huge black hole absorbs energy from the heat ocean further, until its
energy overpasses certain threshold value, leading to a new big bang.
  The heat ocean has energy, hence it has mass, too. Calculations show that,
the mass of the heat ocean surpasses overwhelmingly the mass of all the real

shaped by strong Doppler and gravitational effects. In this paper the shape of
the iron line, its variability characteristics and the robustness of this
spectral interpretation are examined using the long XMM-Newton observation
taken in 2001. A variety of spectral models, both including and excluding the
effects of strong gravity, are compared to the data in a uniform fashion. The
results strongly favour models in which the spectrum is shaped by emission from
a relativistic accretion disc. It is far more difficult to explain the 3-10 keV
spectrum using models dominated by absorption (either by warm or partially
covering cold matter), emission line blends, curved continua or additional
continuum components. These provide a substantially worse fit to the data and
fail to explain other observations (such as the simultaneous BeppoSAX
spectrum). This reaffirms the veracity of the relativistic `disc line'
interpretation. The short term variability in the shape of the energy spectrum
is investigated and explained in terms of a two-component emission model. Using
a combination of spectral variability analyses the spectrum is successfully
decomposed into a variable power-law component (PLC) and a reflection dominated
component (RDC). The former is highly variable while the latter is
approximately constant throughout the observation, leading to the well-known
spectral variability patterns. (Abridged)

periodicities are nearly equally spaced, and we explore the consequences of

  The general stability of the pulsation amplitudes and phases allows us to use
the pulsation phases to constrain the timescale of evolution for this sdBV
star. Additionally, we are able to place interesting limits on any stellar or

metallic beads (slightly oxidised) under an applied stress. A transition from
an insulating to a conductive state is observed as the applied current is
increased. The voltage-current (U-I) characteristics are nonlinear and
hysteretic, and saturate to a low voltage per contact (0.4 V). Our 1D
experiment allows us to understand phenomena (such as the ""Branly effect"")
related to this conduction transition by focusing on the nature of the contacts
instead of the structure of the granular network. We show that this transition
comes from an electro-thermal coupling in the vicinity of the microcontacts
between each bead - the current flowing through these contact points generates
their local heating which leads to an increase of their contact areas, and thus
enhances their conduction. This current-induced temperature rise (up to 1050
deg C) results in the microsoldering of the contact points (even for voltages
as low as 0.4 V). Based on this self-regulated temperature mechanism, an
analytical expression for the nonlinear U-I back trajectory is derived, and is
found to be in very good agreement with the experiments. In addition, we can
determine the microcontact temperature with no adjustable parameters. Finally,
the stress dependence of the resistance is found to be strongly non-hertzian
due to the presence of the surface films. This dependence cannot be usually
distinguished from the one due to the disorder of the granular contact network

an equilibrium and nonequilibrium spin (magnetization) in the emitter, base, or
collector. The low-injection theory of spin-polarized transport through MBTs
and of a more general case of an array of magnetic {\it p-n} junctions is
developed and illustrated on several important cases. Two main physical
phenomena are discussed: electrical spin injection and spin control of current
amplification (magnetoamplification). It is shown that a source spin can be
injected from the emitter to the collector. If the base of an MBT has an
equilibrium magnetization, the spin can be injected from the base to the
collector by intrinsic spin injection. The resulting spin accumulation in the
collector is proportional to $\exp(qV_{be}/k_BT)$, where $q$ is the proton
charge, $V_{be}$ is the bias in the emitter-base junction, and $k_B T$ is the
thermal energy. To control the electrical current through MBTs both the
equilibrium and the nonequilibrium spin can be employed. The equilibrium spin
controls the magnitude of the equilibrium electron and hole densities, thereby
controlling the currents. Increasing the equilibrium spin polarization of the
base (emitter) increases (decreases) the current amplification. If there is a
nonequilibrium spin in the emitter, and the base or the emitter has an
equilibrium spin, a spin-valve effect can lead to a giant magnetoamplification
effect, where the current amplifications for the parallel and antiparallel
orientations of the the equilibrium and nonequilibrium spins differ
significantly. The theory is elucidated using qualitative analyses and is
illustrated on an MBT example with generic materials parameters.

in a host material requires the numerical treatment of the boundary in a finite
simulation domain. For the study of a self-assembled InAs dot embedded in GaAs,
three kinds of boundary conditions are examined within the empirical
tight-binding model: (i) the periodic boundary condition, (ii) raising the
orbital energies of surface atoms, and (iii) raising the energies of dangling
bonds at the surface. The periodic boundary condition requires a smooth
boundary and consequently a larger GaAs buffer than the two nonperiodic
boundary conditions. Between the nonperiodic conditions, the dangling-bond
energy shift is more efficient than the orbital-energy shift, in terms of the
elimination of nonphysical surface states in the middle of the gap. A
dangling-bond energy shift bigger than 5 eV efficiently eliminates all of the
mid-gap surface states and leads to interior states that are highly insensitive
to the change of the energy shift.

possibility of cutting off the interaction potential. Simulations on a dipolar
two-line system lead to the observation that the ferromagnetic state is much
more sensitive to the interaction cutoff $R$ than the corresponding
anti-ferromagnetic state. For $R \gtrsim 8$ (measured in particle diameters)
there is no substantial change in the energetical balance of the ferromagnetic

over the anti-ferromagnetic state, while the situation is changed rapidly for
lower interaction cutoff values, leading to the disappearance of the

anti-ferromagnetic two-line systems and we observed that the cutoff has a major
impact on the energetical balance of the ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic

reasonable choice for dipole-dipole interaction cutoff in two-dimensional

gives a semi-quantitative understanding of the doping dependences of a variety
of experimental observables in the superconducting state of the cuprates. In
this paper we revisit these issues using the ``renormalized mean field theory''
of Zhang, Gros, Rice and Shiba based on the Gutzwiller approximation in which
the kinetic and superexchange energies are renormalized by different
doping-dependent factors $g_{t}$ and $g_{S}$ respectively. We point out a
number of consequences of this early mean field theory for experimental
measurements which were not available when it was first explored, and observe
that it is able to explain the existence of the pseudogap, properties of nodal
quasiparticles and approximate spin-charge separation, the latter leading to
large renormalizations of the Drude weight and superfluid density. We use the
Lee-Wen theory of the phase transition as caused by thermal excitation of nodal
quasiparticles, and also obtain a number of further experimental confirmations.
Finally, we remark that superexchange, and not phonons, are responsible for
d-wave superconductivity in the cuprates.

frequencies for the Schwarzschild black hole are evenly spaced with a spacing
that depends only on the surface gravity. On the other hand, for massless
minimally coupled scalar fields, there exist no QNMs in the pure DeSitter
spacetime. It is not clear what the structure of the QNMs would be for the
Schwarzschild-DeSitter (SDS) spacetime, which is characterized by two different
surface gravities. We provide a simple derivation of the imaginary parts of the
QNM frequencies for the SDS spacetime by calculating the scattering amplitude
in the first Born approximation and determining its poles. We find that, for
the usual set of boundary conditions in which the incident wave is scattered
off the black hole horizon, the imaginary parts of the QNM frequencies have a
equally spaced structure with the level spacing depending on the surface
gravity of the black hole. Several conceptual issues related to the QNM are
discussed in the light of this result and comparison with previous work is
presented.

gravity-induced radiative corrections could be relevant for the trans-Planckian

radiative corrections to the self-energy of a scalar particle propagating in a
thermal bath of gravitons in Minkowski spacetime. We obtain terms which
originate from the thermal bath and which indeed break the Lorentz invariance
that possessed the propagator in the vacuum. Rather unexpectedly, however, the
terms which break Lorentz invariance vanish in the high three-momentum limit.
We also found that the imaginary part, which gives the rate of approach to
thermal equilibrium, vanishes at one loop.

loop corrections to the charged Higgs couplings which are then compared with
the supersymmetric loop corrections to the neutral Higgs couplings previously
computed. It is found that the weak isospin violations can be quite
significant, i.e, as much as 40-50% or more of the total loop correction to the
Yukawa coupling. The effects of CP phases are also studied and it is found that
these effects can either enhance or suppress the weak isospin violations. We
also investigate the weak isospin violation effects on the branching ratio
$BR(H^-\to\bar t b)/ BR(H^-\to \bar\nu_{\tau}\tau^-)$ and show that the effects
are sensitive to CP phases. Thus an accurate measurement of this branching
ratio along with the branching ratio of the neutral Higgs boson decays can
provide a measure of weak isospin violation along with providing a clue to the

spaces associated to von Neumann algebras. We find that an isometry T: Lp(M_1)
to Lp(M_2) (1 le p < infty, p not 2) can be canonically expressed in a certain
simple form whenever M_1 has variants of Watanabe's extension property.
Conversely, this form always defines an isometry provided that M_1 is
""approximately semifinite"" (defined below). Although neither of these
properties is fully understood, we show that they are enjoyed by all semifinite
algebras and hyperfinite algebras (with no summand of type I_2), plus others.
Thus the classification is stronger than Yeadon's theorem for semifinite
algebras (and its recent improvement in [JRS]), and the proof uses independent
techniques. Related to this, we examine the modular theory for positive
projections from a von Neumann algebra onto a Jordan image of another von
Neumann algebra, and use such projections to construct new Lp isometries by
interpolation. Some complementary results and questions are also presented.

necessarily a hyperplanar ball or a spherical cap, even in the simplest case of

this is true for the case of hypersurfaces in R^{n+1} with constant scalar
curvature, and more generally, hypersurfaces with constant higher order r-mean
curvature, when r>1. In this paper we deal with some aspects of the classical
problem above, by considering it in a more general context. Specifically, our
starting general ambient space is an orientable Riemannian manifold, where we
will consider a general geometric configuration consisting of an immersed
hypersurface with boundary on an oriented hypersurface P. For such a geometric
configuration, we study the relationship between the geometry of the
hypersurface along its boundary and the geometry of its boundary as a
hypersurface of P, as well as the geometry of P. Our approach allows us to
derive, among others, interesting results for the case where the ambient space
has constant curvature. In particular, we are able to extend the previous
symmetry results to the case of hypersurfaces with constant higher order r-mean
curvature in the hyperbolic space and in the sphere.

in the $^{1}S_0$ channel. It is introduced by recasting the gap equation
written in terms of the bare force into a fully equivalent pairing problem.
Within this approach, the proposed interaction reproduces the pairing
properties provided by the realistic $AV18$ force very accurately. Written in
the canonical basis of the actual Bogolyubov transformation, the force takes
the form of an off-shell in-medium two-body matrix in the superfluid phase
multiplied by a BCS occupation number $2 \rho_{m}$. This interaction is finite
ranged, non local, total-momentum dependent and density dependent. The factor
$2 \rho_{m}$ emerging from the recast of the gap equation provides a natural
cut-off and makes zero-range approximations of the effective vertex meaningful.
Performing such an approximation, the roles of the range and of the density
dependence of the interaction can be disentangled. The isoscalar and isovector
density-dependences derived ab-initio provide the pairing force with a strong
predictive power when extrapolated toward the drip-lines. Although finite
ranged and non local, the proposed interaction makes HFB calculations of finite
nuclei in coordinate space tractable. Through the two-basis method, its
computational cost is of the same order as for a zero-range force.

0.02 for the vertical displacement and 1.00 -+ 0.07 for the horizontal
displacements. For the first time horizontal displacements caused by
atmospheric pressure loading have been detected. The closeness of these
admittance factors to unity allows us to conclude that on average our model
quantitatively agrees with the observations within the error budget of the

longitudinal electric field, provides a signal breaking mirror symmetry while
preserving the cylindrical symmetry of the set-up. The excited vapor acts on
the probe beam as a linear dichroic amplifier, imprinting a very specific
signature on the detected signal. Our differential polarimeter is oriented to
yield a null result unless the excited atoms are endowed with a chirality of
some kind. Ideally, only the APV (E-odd) and the calibration (E-even) signals
contribute to a chiral atomic response, a situation highly favourable to the
detection of a tiny effect. In the present work we give a thorough analysis of
possible unwanted defects like stray transverse fields or misalignments which
would spoil the ideal set-up and lead to chiral systematics. A possible way to
suppress such effects is to perform global rotations of the experiment by
incremental steps of 45 degrees, leaving both stray fields and misalignments
unaltered. The conspiration of at least two defects is necessary to affect the
E-odd polarimeter signal. The transverse nature of the defects manifests itself
by an azimuthal cosine square modulation. The harmful systematics are those
which survive the averaging over four successive configurations. They require
the presence of a stray transverse electric field, which can be determined and
eventually minimized by auxiliary measurements of the systematic effects,
amplified by applying a known external magnetic field. Transverse stray
magnetic fields must be compensated by a similar procedure. We also propose
statistical correlation tests as diagnoses of the aforementioned systematic
effects.

minimize the length of intra-cortical wiring. Thus we attempt to understand the

neurons into two classes: left- and right-eye dominated. We find that
segregation of neurons into monocular regions reduces wire length if the number
of connections to the neurons of the same class (intraocular) differs from the
number of interocular connections. The shape of the regions depends on the
relative fraction of neurons in the two classes. We find that if both classes
are almost equally represented, the optimal ODP consists of interdigitating
stripes. If one class is less numerous than the other, the optimal ODP consists
of patches of the less abundant class surrounded by the neurons of the other
class. We predict that the transition from stripes to patches occurs when the
fraction of neurons dominated by the underrepresented eye is about 40%. This
prediction agrees with the data in macaque and Cebus monkeys. We also study the

definition, except perhaps in special cases. In contrast to statistical and

replaces the notion of conditional wave function, as the object with the same

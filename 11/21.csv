segregation in young star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. HST/WFPC2
observations on NGC 1818, NGC 2004 & NGC 2100 in the Large Magellanic Cloud and
NGC 330 in the Small Magellanic Cloud have been used for the application of
diagnostic tools for mass segregation: i) the radial density profiles of the
clusters for various mass groups and ii) their mass functions (MFs) at various
radii around their centres. All four clusters are found to be mass segregated,
but each one in a different manner. Specifically not all the clusters in the
sample show the same dependence of their density profiles on the selected
magnitude range, with NGC 1818 giving evidence of a strong such relation and
NGC 330 showing only a hint of the phenomenon. NGC 2004 did not also show any
significant signature of mass segregation in its density profiles. The MFs
radial dependence provides clear proof of the phenomenon for NGC 1818, NGC 2100
and NGC 2004, while for NGC 330 it gives only indications. An investigation on
the constraints introduced by the application of both diagnostic tools is
presented. We also discuss the problems related to the construction of a
reliable MF for a cluster and their impact on the investigation of the
phenomenon of mass segregation. We find that the MFs of these clusters as they
were constructed with two methods, are comparable to Salpeter's IMF. A
discussion is given on the dynamical status of the clusters and a test is
applied on the equipartition among several mass groups in them. Both showed
that the observed mass segregation in the clusters is of primordial nature.

supernova (SN) that exploded within a pre-existing bubble blown-up by a runaway
massive star (the SN progenitor) during the final (Wolf-Rayet) phase of its
evolution. This suggestion implies that (a) the SN blast centre was
significantly offset from the geometric centre of the wind-blown bubble (i.e.
from the centre of the future SNR), (b) the bubble was surrounded by a massive
wind-driven shell, and (c) the SN blast wave was drastically decelerated by the
interaction with the shell. Therefore, one can understand how the relatively
young and low-velocity pulsar PSR B1757-24 was able to escape from the
associated SNR G5.4-1.2 and why the inferred vector of pulsar transverse
velocity does not point away from the geometric centre of the SNR. A possible
origin of the radio source G5.27-0.9 (located between PSR B1757-24 and the SNR
G5.4-1.2) is proposed. It is suggested that G5.27-0.9 is a lobe of a low Mach
number (\simeq 1.7) jet of gas outflowing from the interior of G5.4-1.2 through
the hole bored in the SNR's shell by the escaping pulsar. It is also suggested
that the non-thermal emission of the comet-shaped pulsar wind nebula originates
in the vicinity of the termination shock and in the cylindric region of
subsonically moving shocked pulsar wind. The role of magnetized wind-driven
shells (swept-up during the Wolf-Rayet phase from the ambient interstellar
medium with the regular magnetic field) in formation of elongated axisymmetric

but their underlying energy source(s) have remained a mystery. However, there
has been evidence for some time now of an association of gamma-ray bursts with
supernovae of Type Ib and Ic, a fact which has been exploited by a number of
models, to explain the gamma-ray burst phenomenon. Here we interpret the
results of basic observations of SN 1987A and of pulsars in globular clusters,
to propose the energy source, which powers at least some long-duration
gamma-ray bursts, as core-collapse following the merger of two white dwarfs,
either as stars or stellar cores. The beaming and intrinsic differences among
gamma-ray bursts arise, at least in part, from differing amounts and
composition of the gas in the merged stellar common envelopes, with the more
energetic bursts resulting from mergers within less massive envelopes. In order
for the beams/jets associated with gamma-ray bursts to form in mergers within
massive common envelopes (as with SN 1987A), much of the intervening stellar
material in the polar directions must be cleared out by the time of
core-collapse, or the beams/jets themselves must clear their own path. The
core-collapse produces supernovae of Type Ib, Ic, or II (as with SN 1987A, a
SNa IIp), leaving a weakly magnetized neutron star remnant with a spin period
near 2 milliseconds. There is no compelling reason to invoke any other model to
account for gamma-ray bursts. Far from being an unusual event, SN 1987A is
typical, having the same merger source of initiation as 95% of all supernovae,
the rare exceptions being Ia's induced via gradual accretion from a binary
companion, and Fe catastrophe II's.

this leads to suppression of power on subgalactic scales, bringing the observed
number of Galactic substructures in line with observation. Decay times of a few

form from the lowest angular momentum gas in proto-galaxies at high redshift.
We show that this leads to a correlation between black hole masses and spheroid
properties, as observed today. We assume that gas in early-forming, rare halos
has a distribution of specific angular momentum similar to that expected for
dark matter halos. This distribution has a significant low angular momentum
tail which implies that every proto-galaxy should contain gas that ends up in a
high-density disc. In halos more massive than a critical threshold of
\~10^8Msun, the discs are gravitationally unstable, and experience an efficient
Lin-Pringle viscosity that allows mass inflow. This process continues until the
first massive stars disrupt the disc. Black holes are created with a
characteristic mass of ~10^5 Msun, independent of the redshift of formation.
This serves as a lower bound for black-hole masses in galaxies today. The
comoving mass density of black hole seeds grows with time, and saturates when
cosmic reionization stops gas cooling in these low-mass systems. By z~15, the
comoving mass density becomes comparable to that inferred from observations,
with room for appropriate additional luminous growth during a later quasar
accretion phase. Hierarchical merging after z~15 naturally leads to a linear
correlation between black-hole mass and stellar spheroid mass, with negligible
black hole masses in disc-dominated galaxies.

break angles motivates the search for a similar relation between the peak
luminosity, $L$, and the jet break angles, $L\propto\theta^{-2}$. Such a
relation implies that the GRB luminosity function determines the angular
distribution. We re-derive the GRB luminosity function using the BATSE peak
flux distribution and compare the predicted distribution with the observed
redshift distribution. The luminosity function can be approximated by a broken
power law with a break peak luminosity of $4.4 \times 10^{51}$ erg/sec, a
typical jet angle of 0.12 rad and a local GRB rate of $0.44 h_{65}^{3}$
Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. The angular distribution implied by $L\propto\theta^{-2}$
agrees well with the observed one, and implies a correction factor to the local
rate due to beaming of $75\pm25$ (instead of 500 as commonly used). The
inferred overall local GRB rate is $33\pm11 h_{65}^{3}$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$.
The luminosity function and angle distribution obtained within the universal
structured jet model, where the angular distribution is essentially $\propto

often attributed to the stellar populations of massive elliptical galaxies.
Extended over a large range of redshifts (0<z<4), it is difficult to estimate
masses at high z from galaxy evolution. In the present paper, we propose to
estimate the stellar masses of galaxies using the galaxy evolution model
PEGASE. We use star formation scenarios that successfully fit faint galaxy
counts and z=0 galaxy templates. They also allow to estimate valid photometric
redshifts. The baryonic mass of the initial gas cloud M_bar is then derived.
The K-z relation is remarkably reproduced by our scenario for elliptical
galaxies of baryonic mass M_(bar,max)=10^12 Msol, at all z up to z=4.
M_(bar,max) is also the maximum mass limit of all types of galaxies. Using
another IMF, even a top-heavy one, does not alter our conclusions. The high
value of M_(bar,max) observed at z > 4 implies that massive clouds were already
formed at early epochs. We also find that the M_(bar,max) limit is similar to
the critical mass M_crit of a self-gravitating cloud regulated by cooling (Rees
& Ostriker, 1977; Silk, 1977). Moreover, the critical size r_crit = 75 Kpc is
remarkably close to the typical diameter of Ly_alpha haloes surrounding distant
radio galaxies. This confirms the validity of the method of baryonic mass
determination based on the K-band luminosity. A puzzling question that remains
to be answered is the short time-scale of mass-accumulation required to form
such massive galaxies at z=4. We discuss the dispersion of the K-z relation and
the link between the active nucleus and a large stellar mass.

features is found, although there is a slight preference for an overall bending
of the spectrum, as well as a decrease in power at very large scales. We have
also tested the algorithm on mock high precision CMB data, calculated from
models with non-scale invariant primordial spectra. The algorithm efficiently
extracts the underlying spectrum, as well as the other cosmological parameters
in each case. Finally we have used the algorithm on a model where an artificial
glitch in the CMB spectrum has been imposed, like the ones seen in the WMAP

  intensity modulation index","Submitted to ApJ Letters",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Recent observations suggest that the level of pulse-to-pulse intensity
modulation observed in a given radio pulsar may depend on its period and period
derivative. Such a ``modulation index relationship'' (MIR) may be an important
tool for determining the physical processes behind the radio emission. In the
context of sparking gap models, the exact functional form of the MIR depends on
the physical processes occurring on the surface of the neutron star in the
region known as the ``vacuum gap.'' Several possible vacuum gap models are
studied here in order to determine the expected MIR for a given model. Current
observations are consistent with two of the four models studied: the curvature
radiation driven vacuum gap and the curvature radiation driven near threshold
vacuum gap (CR-NTVG). It is shown that the inverse Compton scattering driven
vacuum gap models are not supported by the current data. Given that the current
data best supports the CR-NTVG model, its possible that all pulsars have strong
(approx 10^13 G) surface magnetic fields.

the explanation for supernovae dimming. We point out that the loss of photons
due to this mixing will induce a strong asymmetry between the luminosity,
d_L(z), and angular-diameter distance, d_A(z), since the latter is unaffected
by mixing. In a first search for such an asymmetry we introduce a dimensionless
mixing amplitude lambda so that lambda=0 if no photons are lost and lambda = 1
if axion-photon mixing occurs. The best-fit to SNIa and radio galaxy data is
lambda = -0.3^{+0.6}_{-0.4} (95% CL), corresponding to an unphysical, negative,
mixing length. This same argument limits the attenuation of light from
supernovae due to dust. We show that future d_L and d_A data from SNAP and
galaxy surveys such as DEEP2 and KAOS will detect or rule out mixing at more
than 5-sigma, almost independently of the dark energy dynamics. Finally we
discuss the constraints from the near maximal polarisation of the gamma-ray
burst (GRB) GRB021206. Since mixing reduces the polarisation of distant
sources, future observations of high redshift GRBs may provide orthogonal
constraints on axion-photon mixing and related scenarios.

in the FR I radio galaxy 3C 31. Adiabatic models require coupling between the
variations of velocity, magnetic field and particle density. They are therefore
more tightly constrained than the models previously presented for 3C 31 by
Laing & Bridle (2002). We show that adiabatic models provide a poorer
description of the data in two crucial respects: they cannot reproduce the
observed magnetic-field structures in detail, and they also predict too steep a
brightness decline along the jets for plausible variations of the jet velocity.
We find that the innermost regions of the jets show the strongest evidence for
non-adiabatic behaviour, and that the adiabatic models provide progressively
better descriptions of the jet emission at larger distances from the galactic
nucleus. We briefly discuss physical processes which might contribute to this
non-adiabatic behaviour. In particular, we develop a parameterized description
of distributed particle injection, which we fit to the observed total
intensities. We show that particles are preferentially injected where bright
X-ray emission is observed, and where we infer that the jets are

environment monitoring. This paper investigates a strategy for energy efficient
monitoring in WSNs that partitions the sensors into covers, and then activates
the covers iteratively in a round-robin fashion. This approach takes advantage
of the overlap created when many sensors monitor a single area. Our work builds
upon previous work in ""Power Efficient Organization of Wireless Sensor
Networks"" by Slijepcevic and Potkonjak, where the model is first formulated. We
have designed three approximation algorithms for a variation of the SET K-COVER
problem, where the objective is to partition the sensors into covers such that
the number of covers that include an area, summed over all areas, is maximized.
The first algorithm is randomized and partitions the sensors, in expectation,
within a fraction 1 - 1/e (~.63) of the optimum. We present two other
deterministic approximation algorithms. One is a distributed greedy algorithm
with a 1/2 approximation ratio and the other is a centralized greedy algorithm
with a 1 - 1/e approximation ratio. We show that it is NP-Complete to guarantee
better than 15/16 of the optimal coverage, indicating that all three algorithms
perform well with respect to the best approximation algorithm possible.
Simulations indicate that in practice, the deterministic algorithms perform far
above their worst case bounds, consistently covering more than 72% of what is
covered by an optimum solution. Simulations also indicate that the increase in
longevity is proportional to the amount of overlap amongst the sensors. The
algorithms are fast, easy to use, and according to simulations, significantly
increase the longevity of sensor networks. The randomized algorithm in
particular seems quite practical.

Closed Dirac strings are stable against local gauge-fixing algorithms only due
to the torus boundary conditions of the lattice. We demonstrate that these
left-over Dirac strings are responsible for the previously observed unphysical
behavior of the propagator of space-like photons (D_T) in the deconfinement
(high temperature) phase. We show how one can monitor the number N_3 of thermal
Dirac strings which allows to separate the propagator measurements into N_3
sectors. The propagator in N_3 \neq 0 sectors is characterized by a non--zero
mass and an anomalous dimension similarly to the confinement phase. Both mass
squared and anomalous dimension are found to be proportional to N_3.
Consequently, in the N_3=0 sector the unphysical behavior of the D_T photon
propagator is cured and the deviation from the free massless propagator
disappears.

indicate BKT phase transition around the self-dual radius and the nontrivial
fixed points of the flow exhibit black hole like phases for a range of
temperatures beyond the self-dual point. One class of fixed point interpolate
between $c=1$ for $R > 1$ and $c=0$ as $R \to 0$ via black hole phase that
emerges after the phase transition. The other two classes of nontrivial fixed
points also develop black hole like behavior beyond R=1. From a thermodynamic
study of the free energy obtained from the Callan-Symanzik equations we show
that all these unstable phases do have negative specific heat. The
thermodynamic quantities indicate that the system does undergo a first order
phase transition near the Hagedorn temperature, around which the new phase is
formed, and exhibits one loop finite energy correction to the Hagedorn density
of states. The flow equations also suggest a deformation of the target space

discuss the extension of this result to a full quantum mechanical derivation of

could have observable consequences. Finally, we suggest interesting ways in

performing a semi-classical analysis we find that quantum effects alter both
the linearity of the trajectory and the vanishing classical intercept:
J:=\alpha(t)= \alpha_0 + \alpha' t +\beta\sqrt{t}. Two features of our Regge

energy to the observed value of the cosmological constant can possibly have the

the universe. The non-renormalizable, infinite contributions which have been
recently shown to occur when one physically imposes boundary conditions on

Hadamard regularization in addition to the zeta method, the ordinary, finite

equation together with an appropriate identification of RG scales with points

similar to that of Brans-Dicke theory. Its consistency imposes severe
constraints on allowed backgrounds. In the new RG-framework, $G$ and $\Lambda$
carry energy and momentum. It is tested in the setting of homogeneous-isotropic
cosmology and is compared to alternative approaches where the fields $G$ and
$\Lambda$ do not carry gravitating 4-momentum. The fixed point regime of the

integral involving the Jost function of a two dimensional scattering problem.We
perform the renormalization by subtracting the contributions from first several

polarized by magnetic string of the similar shape and spinor vacuum interacting

higher order heat kernel coefficients.

to a new chapter of representation theory - harmonic analysis for
noncommutative groups with infinite-dimensional dual space.
  I omitted detailed proofs but tried to explain the main ideas of the theory
and its connections with other fields. The fact that irreducible
representations of the groups in question depend on infinitely many parameters
leads to a number of new effects which never occurred in conventional
noncommutative harmonic analysis. A link with stochastic point processes is
especially emphasized.
  The exposition focuses on a single group, the infinite symmetric group. The
reason is that presently this particular example is worked out the most.
Furthermore, the infinite symmetric group can serve as a very good model for
more complicated groups like the infinite-dimensional unitary group.

instability in transient dynamics and cell-cell interaction. In a long time
behavior, extinction of multiple cells is repeated, which leads to itinerancy
over successive quasi-stable multi-cellular states consisting of different

that the plasticity of cells decreases before the large extinction, from which

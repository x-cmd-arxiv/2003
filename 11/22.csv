structure is mapped detail. There are temperature variations down to ~1 kpc in
the brightest regions. Globally, the strongest X-ray surface brightness
features appear to be caused by temperature changes. Density and temperature
changes conspire to give approximate azimuthal balance in pressure showing that
the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium. Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe and Ni abundance
profiles rise inward from about 100 kpc, peaking at about 30-40 kpc. Most of
these abundances drop inwards of the peak, but Ne shows a central peak, all of
which may be explained by resonance scattering. There is no evidence for a
widespread additional cooler temperature component in the cluster with a
temperature greater than a factor of two from the local temperature. There is
however evidence for a widespread hard component which may be nonthermal. The
temperature and abundance of gas in the cluster is observed to be correlated in
a manner similar to that found between clusters.

gravity waves generated from clustering matter, that is, induced tensor modes
from scalar modes; and we discuss the generation of density fluctuations
induced by gravity waves -- scalar modes from tensor perturbations. We derive a
linear system of evolution equations for second-order gauge-invariant variables
which characterise fully the induced modes of interest, with a source formed
from variables quadratic in first-order quantities; these we transform into
fully-fledged second-order gauge-invariant variables. Both the invariantly
defined variables and the key evolution equations are considerably simpler than
similar gauge-invariant results derived by other methods. By finding analytical
solutions, we demonstrate that non-linear effects can significantly amplify or
dampen modes present in standard linearised cosmological perturbation theory,
thereby providing an important source of potential error in, and refinement of,
the standard model. Moreover, these effects can dominate at late times, and on
super-Hubble scales.

  Santa Fe, NM",,"10.1063/1.1810851",,"astro-ph",,"  The essence of the ``Supercritical Pile'' model is a process for converting
the energy stored in the relativistic protons of a Relativistic Blast Wave
(RBW) of Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ into electron -- positron pairs of similar
Lorentz factor, while at the same time emitting most of the GRB luminosity at
an energy $E_p \simeq 1$ MeV. This is achieved by scattering the synchrotron
radiation emitted by the RBW in an upstream located ``mirror'' and then
re-intercepting it by the RBW. The repeated scatterings of radiation between
the RBW and the ``mirror'', along with the threshold of the pair production
reaction $p \gamma \to p e^-e^+$, lead to a maximum in the GRB luminosity at an
energy $E_p \simeq 1$ MeV, {\sl independent of the value of $\Gamma$}.
Furthermore, the same threshold implies that the prompt $\gamma-$ray emission
is only possible for $\Gamma$ larger than a minimum value, thereby providing a
``natural'' account for the termination of this stage of the GRB as the RBW
slows down. Within this model the $\gamma-$ray ($E \sim 100$ keV -- 1 MeV)
emission process is due to Inverse Compton scattering and it is thus expected
to be highly polarized if viewed at angles $\theta \simeq 1/\Gamma$ to the
RBW's direction of motion. Finally, the model also predicts lags in the light
curves of the lower energy photons with respect to those of higher energy;
these are of purely kinematic origin and of magnitude $\Delta t \simeq 10^{-2}$
s, in agreement with observation.

C depletion with advancing evolutionary state beginning at the RGB bump region.
but the overall depletion in the clusters is larger than that of the field

three stellar samples. Both M3 and M13 show evidence of high-temperature proton
capture synthesis from the ON, NeNa, and MgAl cycles, while there is no
evidence for such synthesis among halo field stars. But the degree of such
extreme proton-capture synthesis in M3 is smaller than it is in M13, and no
indication that O depletions are a function of advancing evolutionary state as
has been claimed for M13. We have also considered NGC 6752, for which Mg
isotopic abundances have been reported by Yong et al. (2003). Giants in NGC
6752 and M13 satisfy the same anticorrelation of O abundances with the ratio
(25Mg+26Mg)/24Mg. This suggests that these abundance ratios arose in the
ejected material of 3-6 solar mass cluster stars. It also suggests that the low
oxygen abundance seen among the most evolved M13 giants arose in hot-bottom O
to N processing in these same intermediate-mass cluster stars. Thus mixing is
required by the dependence of some abundance ratios on luminosity, but an
earlier nucleosynthesis process in a hotter environment than giants or
main-sequence stars is required by the variations previously seen in stars near
the main sequence.

cumulative GCVFs of the simulated clusters are very similar across a wide range

GCVF is consistent with the simulations. The slope of the observed cluster GCVF
is -2.5, independent of cluster velocity dispersion. The average slope of the

baryons on galaxy rotation curves is to flatten the simulated cluster GCVF into
better agreement with observations. Finally, we find that the field GCVF

the large cosmic variance associated with anisotropy measurements at tens of
degree angular scales only limited information related to reionization, such as
the optical depth to electron scattering, can be extracted. The inhomogeneities
in the free-electron population lead to an additional secondary polarization
anisotropy contribution at arcminute scales. While the fluctuation amplitude,
relative to dominant primordial fluctuations, is small, we suggest that a
cross-correlation between arcminute scale CMB polarization data and a tracer
field of the high redshift universe, such as through fluctuations captured by
the 21 cm neutral Hydrogen background or those in the infrared background
related to first proto-galaxies, may allow one to study additional details
related to reionization. For this purpose, we discuss an optimized higher order
correlation measurement, in the form of a three-point function, including
information from large angular scale CMB temperature anisotropies in addition
to arcminute scale polarization signal related to inhomogeneous reionization.
We suggest that the proposed bispectrum can be measured with a substantial
signal-to-noise ratio and does not require all-sky maps of CMB polarization or
that of the tracer field. A measurement such as the one proposed may allow one
to establish the epoch when CMB polarization related to reionization is

usually a galaxy acting as the main lens. Some, maybe all of these quasars are
also affected by microlensing, the effects of stellar mass objects in the
lensing galaxy. Stellar microlensing not only has photometric effects
(magnitude fluctuations of the quasar images), it also affects the observed
position of the images. This astrometric effect was first explored by Lewis and
Ibata (1998): the position of the quasar - i.e. the center-of-light of the many
microimages - can shift by tens of microarcseconds due to the relatively sudden
(dis-)appearance of a pair of microimages when a caustic is being crossed.
  We explore this effect quantitatively for different values of the surface
mass density and external shear covering most of the known multiple quasar
systems. We show examples of microlens-induced quasar motion and the
corresponding light curves for different quasar sizes. We evaluate
statistically the occurrence of large shifts in angular position and their
correlation with apparent brightness fluctuations. We also show statistical
relations between positional offsets and time from random starting points.
  As the amplitude of the astrometric offset depends on the source size,
astrometric microlensing signatures of quasars - combined with the photometric
variations - will provide very good constraints on the size of quasars as a
function of wavelength. We predict that such signatures will be detectable for
realistic microlensing scenarios with near future technology in the
infrared/optical (Keck-Interferometry, VLTI, SIM, GAIA). Such detections will
show that not even high redshift quasars define a 'fixed' coordinate system.

gaseous component associated with the hot grains. This paper employs a state of
the art grain model and shows that the gas must be very hot, with temperatures
in the neighborhood of 10^6 K. The dusty component has a covering factor of
roughly 50% and so this region also reprocesses much of the total x-ray

wave amplitude. There may then exist a mutual self-stabilisation of the waves
amplitude together with the irregular morphology of the coast. A simple model
of such stabilisation is studied. It leads, through a complex dynamics of the
earth-sea interface, to the appearance of a stationary fractal seacoast with
dimension close to 4/3. Fractal geometry plays here the role of a morphological
attractor directly related to percolation geometry.

the gauge theory. We find a rich and mathematically appealing structure of the
supersymmetric embeddings of a D5-brane probe in this background. Besides, we
compute the mass spectrum of the low energy excitations of N=1 SQCD (mesons)

relativistic particles. There it was demonstrated that, by applying a
consistent quantization scheme to a classical model of a spinless relativistic
particle as well as to the Berezin-Marinov model of 3+1 Dirac particle, it is
possible to obtain a consistent relativistic quantum mechanics of such
particles. In the present article we apply a similar approach to the problem of
quantizing the massive 2+1 Dirac particle. However, we stress that such a
problem differs in a nontrivial way from the one in 3+1 dimensions. The point
is that in 2+1 dimensions each spin polarization describes different fermion
species. Technically this fact manifests itself through the presence of a
bifermionic constant and of a bifermionic first-class constraint. In
particular, this constraint does not admit a conjugate gauge condition at the
classical level. The quantization problem in 2+1 dimensions is also interesting
from the physical viewpoint (e.g. anyons). In order to quantize the model, we
first derive a classical formulation in an effective phase space, restricted by
constraints and gauges. Then the condition of preservation of the classical
symmetries allows us to realize the operator algebra in an unambiguous way and
construct an appropriate Hilbert space. The physical sector of the constructed
quantum mechanics contains spin-1/2 particles and antiparticles without an
infinite number of negative-energy levels, and exactly reproduces the
one-particle sector of the 2+1 quantum theory of a spinor field.

algebraic system $A$ by finite algebraic systems of some class $\K$. For the
case of a discrete algebraic system this definition is equivalent to the
well-known definition of a local embedding of an algebraic system $A$ in a
class $\K$ of algebraic systems. According to this definition $A$ is locally
embedded in $K$ iff it is a subsystem of an ultraproduct of some systems in
$\K$. We obtain a similar characterization of approximation of a locally
compact system $A$ by systems in $\K$.
  We inroduce the bounded formulas of the signature of $A$ and their
approximations similar to those introduced by C.W.Henson \cite{he} for Banach
spaces. We prove that a positive bounded formula $\f$ holds in $A$ if all
precise enough approximations of $\f$ hold in all precise enough approximations
of $A$.
  We prove that a locally compact field cannot be approximated by finite
associative rings (not necessary commutative). Finite approximations of the
field $\R$ can be concedered as computer systems for reals. Thus, it is
impossible to construct a computer arithmetic for reals that is an associative
ring.

  origin of the Permian Extinction","10 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.geo-ph",,"  Recent documentation of extreme atmospheric sulfur and methane contents at
the time of the vast Permo-Triassic (P-T) extinction makes it possible to
interpret an observation that has lain unnoticed in the geological literature
for 40 years. This is the finding of microscopic metallic lead tear drops in
the fluvial strata of the early Triassic sandstones that overlie Permian coal
beds and other sedimentary deposits in the Sydney basin of Australia. Elemental
lead is almost unknown in nature, so its occurrence in these graphite-loaded
sandstones is a provocative finding. While climate change and vulcanism could
explain the carbon and sulfur anomalies, the only way to account for metallic
lead aerodynamic droplets is by massive impact and vaporization of lead
mineral-containing formations. Since lead occurs geologically as the sulfide
and since lead is an easily reduced element, its occurrence in conjunction with
sulfur and carbon count anomalies suggests a bolide impact on carbon-loaded
strata in a sulfide mineral-rich region. From these clues, and from stream
cross-bedding data, we identify a probable site for the impact, in Bass Strait
between Tasmania and Victoria. A gravitational anomaly, similar to that known
at the site of the Cretacious-Tertiary (C-T) impact site, conforms with a
central uplift. The sudden compression at an Australian impact site would
provoke tension fissuring on the opposite side of a shell- structured planet,
hence is consistent with the unprecedented flood basalts initiated in Siberia
at the P-T boundary. Our interpretation requires that lead microspheres and
graphite occur together elsewhere, possibly in Antarctic sandstones.

  Layouts of Switching Parameters","LaTeX, 30 pages, 20 pictures",,,,"q-bio.MN",,"  We consider a model of large regulatory gene expression networks where the
thresholds activating the sigmoidal interactions between genes and the signs of
these interactions are shuffled randomly. Such an approach allows for a
qualitative understanding of network dynamics in a lack of empirical data
concerning the large genomes of living organisms. Local dynamics of network
nodes exhibits the multistationarity and oscillations and depends crucially
upon the global topology of a ""maximal"" graph (comprising of all possible
interactions between genes in the network). The long time behavior observed in
the network defined on the homogeneous ""maximal"" graphs is featured by the
fraction of positive interactions ($0\leq \eta\leq 1$) allowed between genes.
There exists a critical value $\eta_c<1$ such that if $\eta<\eta_c$, the
oscillations persist in the system, otherwise, when $\eta>\eta_c,$ it tends to
a fixed point (which position in the phase space is determined by the initial
conditions and the certain layout of switching parameters). In networks defined
on the inhomogeneous directed graphs depleted in cycles, no oscillations arise
in the system even if the negative interactions in between genes present
therein in abundance ($\eta_c=0$). For such networks, the bidirectional edges
(if occur) influence on the dynamics essentially. In particular, if a number of
edges in the ""maximal"" graph is bidirectional, oscillations can arise and
persist in the system at any low rate of negative interactions between genes
($\eta_c=1$). Local dynamics observed in the inhomogeneous scalable regulatory
networks is less sensitive to the choice of initial conditions. The scale free
networks demonstrate their high error tolerance.

of displaced number states and two photon coherent states and show it to
provide an efficient method for computing and interpreting the photon number
distribution . This result is interesting in particular for the two photon
coherent states which, for high squeezing, have the probabilities of even and
odd photon numbers oscillating independently.

basic one-qubit gates and swap gate are obtained for a quantum computer based
on logical qubits. We calculated the errors caused by imperfect pulses which
implement the quantum logic gates. It is numerically demonstrated that the
probability error is proportional to $\epsilon^4$, while the phase error is
proportional to $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the characteristic deviation
from the perfect pulse duration.

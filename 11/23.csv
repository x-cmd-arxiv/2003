  Freeman",,,,"astro-ph",,"  2MASS has provided a three-dimensional map of the >360 degree, wrapped tidal
tails of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy, as traced by M giant
stars. With the inclusion of radial velocity data for stars along these tails,
strong constraints exist for dynamical models of the Milky Way-Sgr interaction.
N-body simulations of Sgr disruption with model parameters spanning a range of
initial conditions (e.g., Sgr mass and orbit, Galactic rotation curve, halo
flattening) are used to find parameterizations that match almost every extant
observational constraint of the Sgr system. We discuss the implications of the
Sgr data and models for the orbit, mass and M/L of the Sgr bound core as well
as the strength, flattening, and lumpiness of the Milky Way potential.

Combining this with the population synthesis results of Podsiadlowski,

the Be/black-hole binaries may be transient systems with very long quiescent

(CAR) in DN and (ii) formation of midgap Andreev bound state (MABS) at the
interface of d-wave superconductors, are responsible for ZBCP, their relative
importance being dependent on the angle $\alpha$ between the interface normal

to CAR in the junctions of low transparency with small Thouless energies, this
is similar to the case of diffusive normal metal / insulator /s-wave
superconductor junctions. With increase of $\alpha$ from zero to $\pi/4$, the
MABS contribution to ZBCP becomes more prominent and the effect of CAR is

back-reaction has to do with applications to theoretical models of production
of the quark-gluon plasma, though we here address practicable solutions for
back-reaction in general. We review the application of the method of adiabatic
regularization to the Klein-Gordon and Dirac fields in order to renormalize the
expectation value of the current and derive a finite coupled set of ordinary
differential equations for the time evolution of the system. Three time scales
are involved in the problem and therefore caution is needed to achieve
numerical stability for this system. Several physical features, like plasma
oscillations and plateaus in the current, appear in the solution. From the
plateau of the electric current one can estimate the number of pairs before the
onset of plasma oscillations, while the plasma oscillations themselves yield
the number of particles from the plasma frequency.
  We compare the field-theory solution to a simple model based on a
relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation, with a particle production source term
inferred from the Schwinger particle creation rate and a Pauli-blocking (or
Bose-enhancement) factor. This model reproduces very well the time behavior of
the electric field and the creation rate of charged pairs of the semiclassical
calculation. It therefore provides a simple intuitive understanding of the
nature of the solution since nearly all the physical features can be expressed

in various geologic and climatic settings. Such landscapes are characterized by
a length-scale for the lateral spacing between channels. We observe a
small-scale version of this process in the form of beach rills and reproduce
channelization in a table-top seepage experiment. On the beach as well as in
the experiments, channels are spontaneously incised by surface flow, but once
initiated, they grow due to water emerging from underground. Field observation
and experiment suggest the process can be described in terms of flow through a
homogeneous porous medium with a freely shaped water table. According to this
theory, small deformations of the underground water table amplify the flux into
the channel and lead to further growth, a phenomenon we call ``Wentworth
instability''. Piracy of groundwater can occur over distances much larger than
the channel width. Channel spacing coarsens with time, until channels reach
their maximum length.

been used to determine a temperature that has been assumed to equal that of the

Consideration of the density of states as a function of energy and total
angular momentum demonstrates that there is a small but significant bias of the
rotor populations that make the temperature extracted from a fit to its
rotational level populations slightly higher than the temperature of the
ripplons of the droplet. This bias grows with both the total angular momentum
of the droplet and with the moment of inertia of the solute molecule.

  derived. 15 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Mechanics can be founded on a principle relating the uncertainty delta-q in
the trajectory of an observable particle to its motion relative to the
observer. From this principle, p.delta-q=const., p being the q-conjugated
momentum, mechanical laws are derived and the meaning of the Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian functions are discussed. The connection between the presented
principle and Hamilton's Least Action Principle is examined.
  Wave mechanics and Schrodinger equation appear without additional assumptions
by choosing the representation for delta-q in the case the motion is not
trajectory describable. The Cramer-Rao inequality serves that purpose. For a
particle hidden from direct observation, the position uncertainty determined by
the enclosing boundaries leads to thermodynamics in a straightforward extension
of the presented formalism.
  The introduction of uncertainty in classical mechanics formulation enables
the translation of mechanical laws into the wide ranging conceptual framework
of information theory. The boundaries between classical mechanics,
thermodynamics and quantum mechanics are defined in terms of informational
changes associated with the system evolution. As a direct application of the
proposed formulation upper bounds for the rate of information transfer are
derived.

sensitive X-ray observations of TV Columbae--an intermediate polar. The
observations were carried out with the RXTE PCA, ROSAT PSPC, and ASCA. Data
were analyzed using a 1-dimensional CLEAN and Bayesian algorithms. The presence
of a nearly sinusoidal modulation due to the spin of the white dwarf is seen
clearly in all the data, confirming the previous reports based on the EXOSAT
data. An improved period of 1909.7+/-2.5s is derived for the spin from the RXTE
data.The binary period of 5.5hr is detected unambiguously in X-rays for the
first time. Several side-bands due to the interaction of these periods are
observed in the power spectra, thereby suggesting contributions from both the
disk-fed and the stream-fed accretion for TV Col. The accretion disk could
perhaps be precessing as side-bands due to the influence of 4 day period on the
orbital period are seen. The presence of a significant power at certain
side-bands of the spin frequency indicates that the emission poles are
asymmetrically located. The strong power at the orbital side-bands seen in both
the RXTE and ROSAT data gives an indication for an absorption site fixed in the
orbital frame. Both the spin and the binary modulation are found to be
energy-dependent. Increased hardness ratio during a broad dip in the intensity
at binary phase of 0.75--1.0 confirms the presence of a strong attenuation due
to additional absorbers probably from an impact site of the accretion stream
with the disk or magnetosphere. Hardness ratio variations and the energy
dependent modulation depth during the spin modulation can be explained by
partially covered absorbers in the path of X-ray emission region in the
accretion stream.

Ly alpha emitters carried out with SuprimeCam on Subaru 8.3-m telescope. Deep
narrowband imaging of the SSA22 field through a 120 A bandpass filter centered
at 8150 A was combined with deep multicolor RIz' SuprimeCam broadband imaging,
and BVRZ imaging taken with CFHT's CFH12K camera to select high-redshift galaxy
candidates. Spectroscopic observations were made using the new wide-field
multi-object DEIMOS spectrograph on Keck for 22 of the 26 candidate objects.
Eighteen objects were identified as z~5.7 Lyman alpha emitters, and a further
nineteenth candidate was identified based on an LRIS spectrum. At the 3.3 A
resolution of the DEIMOS spectra the asymmetric profile for Ly alpha emission
with its steep blue fall-off can be clearly seen. We use this to describe the
distribution of equivalent widths and the continuum color break properties for
z~5.7 Ly alpha galaxies compared with foreground objects. The large majority
(>75%) of Ly alpha lines have rest frame equivalent widths less than 240 A and
can be understood in terms of young star forming galaxies with a Salpeter
initial mass function for the stars. With narrowband selection criteria of I-N
> 0.7 and N<25.05 (AB mags) we find a surface density of Ly alpha emitters of
0.03 per square arcminute per (deltaz=0.1) to a limiting flux just under 2e-17

at lower redshifts to the lowest measurable luminosity of 1e43 ergs/s as is the
universal star formation rate based on their continuum properties. We note that
the objects are highly structured in both spatial and spectral properties on
the angular scale of the fields (~60 Mpc), and that multiple fields will have
to be averaged to accurately measure their ensemble properties.

have been determined from 19 FeII lines and zinc abundances from the 4722.2,
4810.5 ZnI lines. The abundances are based on a classical 1D, LTE model
atmosphere analysis, but effects of 3D hydrodynamical modelling on the [S/Fe],
[Zn/Fe] and [S/Zn] ratios are shown to be small. We find that most halo stars
with metallicities in the range -3.2 < [Fe/H] < -0.8 have a near-constant
[S/Fe] = +0.3; a least square fit to [S/Fe] vs. {Fe/H] shows a slope of only
-0.04 +/- 0.01. Among halo stars with -1.2 < [Fe/H] < -0.8 the majority have
[S/Fe] ~ +0.3, but two stars (previously shown to have low [alpha/Fe] ratios)
have [S/Fe] ~ 0. For disk stars with [Fe/H] > -1, [S/Fe] decreases with
increasing [Fe/H]. Hence, sulphur behaves like other typical alpha-capture
elements, Mg, Si and Ca. Zinc, on the other hand, traces iron over three orders
of magnitude in [Fe/H], although there is some evidence for a small systematic
Zn overabundance ([Zn/Fe] ~ +0.1) among metal-poor disk stars and for halo
stars with [Fe/H] < -2.0. Recent measurements of S and Zn in ten damped

in the range -2.1 < [Zn/H] < -0.15 show an offset relative to the [S/Zn] -

discussed, including low and intermittent star formation rates in DLAs.

major optical emission lines. The [O III] 5007 line provides the first direct
evidence of optical emission originating from G 82.2+5.3. Filamentary emission
is detected in the west and east areas, roughly defining an ellipsoidal shell.
The [O III] emission is rather well correlated with the radio emission
suggesting their association, while typical fluxes are found in the range of
20-30x10^{-17} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} arcsec^{-2}. Deep long-slit spectra taken at
specific positions of the remnant verify that the filamentary emission
originates from shock heated gas with shock velocities ~100 km/s and low
electron densities, while the diffuse [O III] emission in the south results
from photoionization processes. The X-ray surface brightness is quite patchy,
missing obvious limb brightening and is dominated by a bright bar-like emission
region which is off-set from the geometric center by ~9'. The X-ray emission is
thermal and requires two temperatures of 0.2 keV and 0.63 keV. The bright bar
region shows overabundant Mg, Si and Fe, which might indicate still radiating
ejecta matter. The azimuthally averaged radial surface profile is consistent
with the matter density changing with distance r from the center ~e^{-r/r_0}
with a characteristic angular length of 36', or, alternatively, with an
r^{-1/2} density profile. The matter inside the remnant is quite likely
structured like a porous cloudy medium. The average matter density is ~0.04 x
d_{1.6}^{-0.5}. Because of the low density and the long cooling times involved
the remnant is more likely to be in the adiabatic phase, which is consistent
with the densities derived for the X-ray plasma and the optical line emission,
but it is not excluded that is has reached the radiating phase.

protostellar evolution. Since they are highly obscured by an extended dusty
envelope, these objects emit mainly in the far-infrared to millimetre
wavelength range. The analysis of their spectral energy distributions with wide
wavelength coverage allows to determine the bolometric temperature and
luminosity. However, a more detailed physical interpretation of the internal
physical structure of these objects requires radiative transfer modelling. We
present modelling results of spectral energy distributions of a sample of nine
Class 0 sources in the Perseus and Orion molecular clouds. The SEDs have been
simulated using a radiative transfer code based on the Monte Carlo method. We
find that a spherically symmetric model for the youngest Class 0 sources allows
to reproduce the observed SEDs reasonably well. From our modelling we derive
physical parameters of our sources, such as their mass, density distribution,
size, etc. We find a density structure of $\rho \sim r^{-2}$ for the collapsing
cores at young ages, evolving to $\rho \sim r^{-3/2}$ at later times.

orientation of the ammonium headgroup, as well as decreasing tensile and shear
stress in the disordered phase. In 2C18-mica, the standard deviation in the z
coordinate for the chain atoms is low and does not increase remarkably on
heating. The backbones display a highly regular structure, which is slightly
obscured by rotations in the C18 backbones and minor headgroup displacements at

significant local pressure which is in part not relieved at 100 deg C. An
increase of the basal-plane spacing at higher temperature is found in both
systems due to larger separation between the two hydrocarbon layers and an
increased z spacing between adjacent chain atoms (=decreased tilt of the chains
relative to the surface normal), and, in C18-mica only, a stronger upward
orientation of the C18 chain at the ammonium headgroup. The likelihood for
chain interdigitation between the two hydrocarbon layers is 0.24 to 0.30 for

general point patterns. Contrary to the conjecture that the lattices associated
with the densest packing of congruent spheres have the smallest variance
regardless of the space dimension, we show that for $d=3$, the body-centered
cubic lattice has a smaller variance than the face-centered cubic lattice.
Finally, for certain hyperuniform disordered point patterns, we evaluate the
direct correlation function, structure factor, and associated critical
exponents exactly.

that the antiferromagnetic order is not affected by the reduction of J' down to

description of the ground state in terms of a Neel phase renormalized by
quantum fluctuations becomes inadequate, and the finite-size spectra develop
features that are not compatible with antiferromagnetic ordering. However, this

certain operators in N=4 SYM and rotating strings with two angular momenta in
the bulk of AdS5xS5. A one-loop field theory computation, which involves
solving a Heisenberg chain by means of the Bethe ansatz agrees with the large
angular momentum limit of a rotating string. We point out that the Heisenberg
chain can be equally well solved by using a sigma model approach. Moreover we
also show that a certain limit, akin to the BMN limit, leads exactly to the
same sigma model for a string rotating with large angular momentum. The
agreement is then at the level of the action. As an upshot we propose that the
rotating string should be identified with a coherent, semi-classical state
built out of the eigenstates of the spin chain. The agreement is then complete.
For example we show that the mean value of the spin <S> gives, precisely, the
position of the string in the bulk. This suggests a more precise formulation of
the AdS/CFT correspondence in the large-N limit and also indicates a way to
obtain string theory duals of other gauge theories.

Single loops in an irreducible representation are multiplicatively renormalized
without mixing, through a renormalization constant which depends upon both
representation and temperature. The values of renormalized loops in the four
lowest representations of SU(3) were measured numerically on small, coarse
lattices. We find that in magnitude, condensates for the sextet and octet loops
are approximately the square of the triplet loop. This agrees with a large $N$
expansion, where factorization implies that the expectation values of loops in
adjoint and higher representations are just powers of fundamental and
anti-fundamental loops. For three colors, numerically the corrections to the
large $N$ relations are greatest for the sextet loop, $\leq 25%$; these
represent corrections of $\sim 1/N$ for N=3. The values of the renormalized
triplet loop can be described by an SU(3) matrix model, with an effective
action dominated by the triplet loop. In several ways, the deconfining phase
transition for N=3 appears to be like that in the $N=\infty$ matrix model of
Gross and Witten.

material media (the conservation laws for energy, linear momentum, angular
momentum, and mass, that establish a balance between the variation of a
physical quantity and the corresponding external action), turn out to be
noncommutative. The noncommutativity of the conservation laws that leads to an
emergence of internal forces and an appearance of the nonequilibrium is a cause
of development of instability in material media (material systems). These
results were obtained with the help of the mathematical apparatus of
skew-symmetric differential forms. To study the causes of developing
instability it is necessary to inspect the evolutionary relation obtained from
equations of the balance conservation laws and to analyze the differential form
commutator that enters into this relation. In the present work the method of
skew-symmetric differential forms has been applied in study of the
thermodynamical and gas dynamical systems. It was shown that the principle of
thermodynamics follows from two conservation laws, namely, the balance
conservation laws for energy and linear momentum. In this case the second
principle of thermodynamics, from which the state function (which specifies a
state of the thermodynamical system) is obtained, follows from the first
principle. A mechanism of development of instability in gas dynamical systems
is described and there are explained such processes as emergence of waves,
vortices, turbulent pulsations and so on.

sequences nor is there an efficient S/M checkpoint, even though the whole
genome (3 billion bases) is completely duplicated within 10-20 minutes. This
leads to the""random-completion problem"" of DNA replication in embryos, where
one needs to find a mechanism that ensures complete, faithful, timely
reproduction of the genome without any sequence dependence of replication
origins. We analyze recent DNA replication data in Xenopus laevis egg extracts
and find discrepancies with models where replication origins are distributed
independently of chromatin structure. Motivated by these discrepancies, we have
investigated the role that chromatin looping may play in DNA replication. We
find that the loop-size distribution predicted from a wormlike-chain model of
chromatin can account for the spatial distribution of replication origins in
this system quantitatively. Together with earlier findings of increasing
frequency of origin firings, our results can explain the random-completion
problem. The agreement between experimental data (molecular combing) and
theoretical predictions suggests that the intrinsic stiffness of chromatin
loops plays a fundamental biological role in DNA replication in early-embryo
Xenopus in regulating the origin spacing.

in great detail. Recent experiments and molecular data suggest that the
individual repair enzymes do not work independently of each other, but rather
interact with each other through currents exchanged along DNA. A damaged site
in DNA hinders this exchange and this makes it possible to quickly free up
resources from error free stretches of DNA. Here the size of the speedup gained
from this current exchange mechanism is calculated and the characteristic
length and time scales are identified. In particular for Escherichia coli we
estimate the speedup to be 50000/N, where N is the number of repair enzymes
participating in the current exchange mechanism. Even though N is not exactly
known a speedup of order 10 is not entirely unreasonable. Furthermore upon over
expression of repair enzymes the detection time only varies as one over the
squareroot of N and not as 1/N. This behavior is of interest in assessing the
impact of stress full and radioactive environments on individual cell mutation
rates.

two-energy-eigenstate systems, the simplest of quantum mechanical systems,
undergoing quantum adiabatic processes and energy exchanges with heat baths,
respectively, at different stages of a cycle. Armed with this class of heat
engines and some interpretation of heat transferred and work performed at the
quantum level, we are able to clarify some important aspects of the second law
of thermodynamics. In particular, it is not sufficient to have the heat source
hotter than the sink, but there must be a minimum temperature difference
between the hotter source and the cooler sink before any work can be extracted
through the engines. The size of this minimum temperature difference is
dictated by that of the energy gaps of the quantum engines involved. Our new
quantum heat engines also offer a practical way, as an alternative to Szilard's
engine, to physically realise Maxwell's daemon. Inspired and motivated by the
Rabi oscillations, we further introduce some modifications to the quantum heat
engines with single-mode cavities in order to, while respecting the second law,
extract more work from the heat baths than is otherwise possible in thermal
equilibria. Some of the results above are also generalisable to quantum heat
engines of an infinite number of energy levels including 1-D simple harmonic

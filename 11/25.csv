  figure of published version","Astrophys.J. 608 (2004) 622-635","10.1086/386327",,"astro-ph",,"  The relatively large Thomson optical depth, tau_e, inferred recently from the
WMAP observations suggests that the Universe was reionized in a more complex
manner than previously believed. However, the value of tau_e provides only an
integral constraint on the history of reionization and, by itself, cannot be
used to determine the nature of the sources responsible for this transition.
Here, we show that the evolution of the ionization state of the intergalactic
medium at high redshifts can be measured statistically using fluctuations in 21
centimeter radiation from neutral hydrogen. By analogy with the mathematical
description of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, we develop a
formalism to quantify the variations in 21 cm emission as a function of both
frequency and angular scale. Prior to and following reionization, fluctuations
in the 21 cm signal are mediated by density perturbations in the distribution
of matter. Between these epochs, pockets of gas surrounding luminous objects
become ionized, producing large HII regions. These ``bubbles'' of ionized
material imprint features into the 21 cm power spectrum that make it possible
to distinguish them from fluctuations produced by the density perturbations.
The variation of the power spectrum with frequency can be used to infer the
evolution of this process. As has been emphasized previously by others, the
absolute 21 cm signal from neutral gas at high redshifts is undetectable owing
to contamination by foreground sources. However, we argue that this source of
noise can be suppressed by comparing maps closely spaced in frequency, i.e.
redshift, so that 21 cm fluctuations from the IGM can be measured against a
much brighter, but smoothly varying (in frequency) background.

large sample of high galactic latitude observations was used, covering a total
solid angle of 5.5 square degrees. Our study is based on a very careful
characterization and subtraction of the instrumental background, which is
crucial for a robust measurement of the faintest diffuse source of the X-ray
sky. The CXB spectrum is consistent with a power law having a photon index
Gamma=1.41+/-0.06 and a normalization of 2.46+/-0.09 photons/(cm^2 s sr keV) at
3 keV (~11.6 photons/(cm^2 s sr keV) at 1 keV), corresponding to a 2-10 keV
flux of (2.24+/-0.16)x10^(-11) erg/(cm^2 s deg) (90% confidence level,
including the absolute flux calibration uncertainty). Our results are in
excellent agreement with two of the most recent CXB measurements, performed
with BeppoSAX LECS/MECS data (Vecchi et al. 1999) and with an independent
analysis of XMM-Newton EPIC/MOS data (Lumb et al. 2002), providing a very
strong constrain to the absolute sky surface brightness in this energy range,
so far affected by a ~40% uncertainty. Our measurement immediately implies that
the fraction of CXB resolved by the recent deep X-ray observations in the 2-10
keV band is of 80+/-7% (1sigma), suggesting the existence of a new population
of faint sources, largely undetected within the current sensitivity limits of
the deepest X-ray surveys.

apart from a normalization constant, the ``true'' time dependence can be
recovered from the inversion of its probability density function. We applied
the inversion method to the observed equivalent width of Hbeta (EW(Hbeta))
distribution for objects in the Terlevich and collaborators Spectrophotometric
Catalogue of HII galaxies and found that their global history of star formation
behaves much closer to the expectations of a continuos star formation model
than to an instantaneous one. On the other hand, when the inversion method is
applied to samples within a restricted metallicity range we find that their
history of star formation behaves much closer to what the instantaneous model
predicts.
  Our main conclusion is that, globally, the evolution of HII galaxies seems
consistent with a succession of short starbursts separated by quiescent periods
and that, while the emission lines trace the properties of the present burst,
the underlying stellar continuum traces the whole star formation history of the
galaxy. Thus, observables like the EW(Hbeta) that combine an emission line
flux, i.e. a parameter pertaining to the present burst, with the continuum
flux, i.e. a parameter that traces the whole history of star formation, should
not be used alone to characterize the present burst.

are intrinsically identical and the energy per solid angle drops as the inverse
square of the angle from the jet axis. The simplicity of the USJ model gives it
a strong predictive power, including a specific prediction for the observed GRB
distribution as a function of both the redshift $z$ and the viewing angle
$\theta$. We show that the current sample of GRBs with known $z$ and estimated
$\theta$ does not agree with the predictions of the USJ model. This can be best
seen for a relatively narrow range in $z$, in which the USJ model predicts that
most GRBs should be near the upper end of the observed range in $\theta$, while
in the observed sample most GRBs are near the lower end of that range. Since
the current sample is very inhomogeneous (i.e. involves many different
detectors), it should be taken with care and cannot be used to rule out the USJ
model. Nevertheless, this sample strongly disfavors the USJ model. Comparing
the prediction for the observed GRB distribution both in $\theta$ and in $z$,
with a larger and more homogeneous GRB sample, like the one expected from
Swift, would either clearly rule out the USJ model, or alternatively, provide a
strong support for it. The test presented here is general, and can be used to
test any model that predicts both a luminosity function and a luminosity-angle

projected velocity \tilde v is of order \tilde v_j. For events toward the Large

important primarily for lenses in the Milky Way disk. In particular, it solves
the puzzle of MACHO-LMC-5, whose microlens parallax measurement had yielded
mass and distance determinations for the lens that were inconsistent with
photometric estimates. Toward the Galactic bulge, \tilde v_j ranges from about
0.2 km/s at the solstice to about 200 km/s at the equinoxes, so the effect of

into account various selection effects on high-redshift galaxies and can show
fundamental observational properties of galaxies, such as luminosity functions
and number-magnitude/redshift relations. DLA systems offer the possibilities of
measuring metal abundance more accurately than faint galaxies. For example,
recent measurements of zinc abundance can provide good evidence for
understanding the processes of metal pollution and star formation in DLA
systems because zinc is virtually unaffected by dust depletion. Here we focus
on this advantage for observation in order to explore the metallicity evolution
in DLA systems at high redshifts. We can consistently show the metallicity
evolution for reasonable models which also reproduce fundamental properties of
local galaxy population. This result suggests that the chemical evolution of
DLA systems can be consistently reconciled with the observational features of
typical galaxies. We also investigate other properties of DLA systems (column
density distribution and mass density of cold gas), and find that star
formation in massive galaxies should be more active than that in low-mass ones.
This is consistent with the results by Nagashima et al. and Cole et al. in
which the star formation timescale is set by reproducing cold gas mass fraction
in local spiral galaxies. Finally we discuss host galaxies associated with DLA
systems. We conclude that they primarily consist of sub-L* and/or dwarf

brightness, temperature and entropy distribution and confirm that the two main
clusters of the system (A1750 N and A1750 C) have just started to interact.
  From the temperature distribution, we calculate that they are likely to merge
sometime in the next 1 Gyr. The more massive cluster, A1750 C, displays a more
complicated temperature structure than expected. We detect a hot region
associated with a density jump ~450 kpc east of the cluster centre, which
appears to be a shock wave. This shock is not connected with the binary merger,
but it is intrinsic to A1750 C itself. From simple physical arguments and
comparison with numerical simulations, we argue that this shock is related to a
merging event that A1750 C has suffered in the past 1-2 Gyr. The larger scale
structure around A1750 suggests that the system belongs to a rich supercluster,
which would presumably increase the likelihood of merger events. These new
XMM-Newton data thus show that A1750 is a complex system, where two clusters
are starting to interact before having re-established equilibrium after a
previous merger. This merger within a merger indicates that the present day
morphology of clusters may depend not only on on-going interactions or the last
major merging event, but also on the more ancient merger history, especially in
dense environments.

The black--body temperatures of the irradiated poles of the white dwarf

synchronous analogues, the Polars. The temperature of the optically thin
post--shock plasma is well constrained in RXJ1712.6-2414 and in RE0751+144 (13

present in RXJ0558.0+5353 and in RE0751+144 and it is favoured in

different energies suggest accretion geometries which cannot be reconciled with
a single and simple configuration.

of the ROSAT error circle of SAX J1810.8-2609. The accurate Chandra position of
that source coincides with the position of the proposed optical counterpart,
strengthening the identification as the counterpart. We detected the neutron
star SXT system in quiescence at an unabsorbed luminosity of ~1x10^32 erg s^-1
(assuming a distance of 4.9 kpc). This luminosity is at the low-end of
quiescent luminosities found in other neutron star SXTs. This renders support
to the existence of a group of faint soft X-ray transients of which the
accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 is the most prominent
member. The quiescent spectrum of SAX J1810.8-2609 is well-fit with an absorbed
power law with photon index of 3.3+-0.5. With a value of 3.3x10^21 cm^-2 the
Galactic absorption is consistent with the value derived in outburst. Since the
spectra of quiescent neutron star SXTs are often fit with an absorbed blackbody
or neutron star atmosphere plus power-law model we also fitted the spectrum
using those fit functions. Both models provide a good fit to the data. If
cooling of the neutron star core and/or crust is responsible for the soft part
of the spectrum the time averaged mass accretion rate must have been very low
(~5.7x10^-13 Msun yr^-1; assuming standard core cooling only) or the neutron
star must be massive. We also discuss the possibility that the thermal spectral

probably as a consequence of selection effects in the SDSS sample. The oxygen
abundance 12 + log O/H of the SDSS galaxies sample lies in the range from ~7.6
(Zsun/12) to ~8.4 (Zsun/2). This sample is merged with a sample of ~100 blue
compact dwarf galaxies with high quality spectra containing some very
low-metallicity objects to study the abundance patterns of low-metallicity
emission-line galaxies. We find that the $\alpha$ element-to-oxygen abundance
ratios do not show any significant trends with the oxygen abundance, in
agreement with previous studies. The Fe/O abundance ratio is smaller than the
solar value, which we interpret as an indication that type Ia supernovae have
not yet appeared in these galaxies, implying an age of less than 1-2 Gyr.
However, a slight decrease of the Fe/O abundance ratio with increasing
metallicity suggests some depletion of iron onto dust in the galaxies with
higher metallicities. The N/O abundance ratio ranges from log N/O= -1.6 to
-0.8. The fact that no galaxy with log N/O < -1.6 was discovered implies that
local low-metallicity emission-line galaxies are of a different nature than
high-redshift damped Lyalpha systems with log N/O of ~-2.3 and that their ages
are probably larger than 100-300 Myr. Our data indicate the existence of a
gradual nitrogen enrichment on a time-scale of a few Myr.

liquid state, is suddenly brought in the glassy state, and therefore out of
equilibrium, in a four-window optical crunch cell which is able to perform
pressure jumps of 3 kbar in a time interval of ~10 ms. The main advantages of
this setup with respect to previous pressure-jump systems is that the pressure
jump is induced through a pressure transmitting fluid mechanically coupled to
the sample stage through a deformable membrane, thus avoiding any flow of the
sample itself in the pressure network and allowing to deal with highly viscous
materials. The dynamics of the sample during the aging regime is investigated

preferably above the cavities in the mica surface with an aluminum-rich

silicon-aluminum plane. With increasing temperature, rearrangements of C18 ions
on the mica surface are found, while 2C18 ions remain tethered due to geometric

very good. We propose a geometric parameter lamba for the saturation of the

tilt angles in continuous layers on mica or other surfaces. The thermal

a weakly interacting Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, and scattering matrices are
introduced at all the junctions. Using a renormalization group method developed
recently for studying the flow of scattering matrices for interacting systems
in one dimension, we compute the conductances of these systems as functions of
the temperature and the wire lengths. We present results for all three regimes
of interest, namely, high, intermediate and low temperature. These correspond
respectively to the thermal coherence length being smaller than, comparable to
and larger than the smallest wire length in the different systems, i.e., the
length of the stub or each arm of the ring or the fifth wire. The
renormalization group procedure and the formulae used to compute the
conductances are different in the three regimes. We present a
phenomenologically motivated formalism for studying the conductances in the
intermediate regime where there is only partial coherence. At low temperatures,
we study the line shapes of the conductances versus the electron energy near
some of the resonances; the widths of the resonances go to zero with decreasing
temperature. Our results show that the conductances of various systems of
experimental interest depend on the temperature and lengths in a non-trivial

random cubic-symmetric anisotropy with probability distribution vanishing

of a stable fixed point corresponding to the random-exchange Ising universality

framework of a fixed-dimension expansion in powers of appropriate quartic

that is accessible from the relevant parameter region. Therefore, if the system
undergoes a continuous transition, it belongs to the random-exchange Ising
universality class. The approach to the asymptotic critical behavior is
controlled by scaling corrections with exponent $\Delta = - \alpha_r$, where
$\alpha_r\simeq -0.05$ is the specific-heat exponent of the random-exchange

principles of hearing has been a great, but still unresolved, challenge for
physicists. Some time ago, it has been pointed out (Egu\'{\i}luz et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 84, 5232, 2000) that the generic mathematical properties of
nonlinear oscillators undergoing a Hopf bifurcation account for the salient
characteristics of hearing. Recently, M.O. Magnasco proposed a model of the
cochlea (Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 058101, 2003), which employs Hopf-type
instabilities for cochlear amplification. While this model reproduces the
input-output behaviour of the cochlea to some extent, the generated model
responses deviate significantly from physiological measurements. The reason for
the discrepancies between model and experiment are due to the critical choice
of the Hopf control parameter close to the bifurcation point ($\mu = 0$). The
question whether the bifurcation parameter has to be chosen critically or
subcritically ($\mu < 0$), is central, and has become the subject of a
scientific debate.In this contribution, we argue that, for sustained input
signals, the control parameter will assume a subcritical value. This leads to
model results that are in close agreement with reported experimental data.

phases of mu and A. Our results indicate that the atomic EDMs receive
significant corrections from four-fermion operators, especially when Im(A) is
the only CP-violating source, whereas the neutron EDM remains relatively
insensitive to these effects. As a consequence, in a large portion of the
parameter space, one cannot infer a separate bound on the electron EDM via the
experimental constraint on the thallium EDM. Furthermore, we find that the
electron EDM can be greatly reduced due to the destructive interference of one-
and two-loop contributions with the latter being dominated by virtual staus.

elementary excitations for k \to 0: a massive energy branch E_a(k) \to M_H,

E_b(k) \to 0. This is similar to the coexistence of phonons and rotons in
superfluid He-4 that, in fact, is usually considered the condensed-matter

  After previous work dedicated to the properties of the gap-less, phonon

with the energy-gap for vortex formation and a massive Higgs boson is like a
roton in superfluid He-4. Within this interpretation of the Higgs particle,
there is no ""naturalness"" problem since M_H remains a naturally intermediate,

the issue of how to treat the dominant radiative corrections in fitting models

conclude that in all but the most pathological of new physics models the
dominant radiative corrections (QED) to the tree level processes of the
standard model can be expected to hold well for new physics. This argument
follows from the fact that the phase space of indirect new physics searches is
generally restrictive (high s' events) in such a way that the factorization of
radiative corrections is expected to hold well and generally universal infrared

playing the role of the F-theory torus. As tests we reproduce the T-dualities
between NS5-branes and KK-monopoles, as well as D6 and D7-branes where we find
the desired F-theory monodromy. Using Hull's proposal for massive IIA, this
realization of T-duality allows us to confirm that the Romans mass is the
central extension of our LE_8. In addition this construction immediately
reproduces the conjectured formula for global topology change from T-duality
with H-flux.

soft terms valid for the different types of fluxes, leading to different
patterns of soft terms. Imaginary anti-selfdual fluxes with G_3 a pure
(3,0)-form lead to soft terms corresponding to dilaton-dominated SUSY-breaking.
More general SUSY-breaking patterns are discussed, arising from more general
fluxes, or from distant anti-D3-branes. The known finiteness properties of
dilaton-dominated soft terms are understood in terms of holography. The above
results are interpreted in the context of the 4d effective supergravity theory,
where flux components correspond to auxiliary fields of e.g. the 4d dilaton and
overall volume modulus. We present semirealistic Type IIB orientifold examples
with (meta)stable vacua leading to non-vanishing soft terms of the
dilaton-domination type. Such models have many of the ingredients of the recent
construction of deSitter vacua in string theory. We finally explore possible
phenomenological applications of this form of SUSY-breaking, where we show that
soft terms are of order M_s^2/M_p. Thus a string scale of order M_s=10^{10}
GeV, and compactification scale three orders of magnitude smaller could explain
the smallness of the weak scale versus the Planck mass.

single complex number $z$ and a positive integer $\rho(m)$. The requirement
that these states realize a resolution of the identity typically results in a
moment problem, where the moments form the positive sequence of real numbers
$\{\rho(m)\}_{m=0}^\infty$. In this paper we obtain new classes of vector
coherent states by simultaneously replacing the complex number $z$ and the
moments $\rho(m)$ of the canonical coherent states by $n \times n$ matrices.
Associated oscillator algebras are discussed with the aid of a generalized
matrix factorial. Two physical examples are discussed. In the first example
coherent states are obtained for the Jaynes-Cummings model in the weak coupling
limit and some physical properties are discussed in terms of the constructed
coherent states. In the second example coherent states are obtained for a
conditionally exactly solvable supersymmetric radial harmonic oscillator.

exist A, B and C in GL_n \CC with singular values alpha, beta and gamma and
ABC=1 if and only if there is a Vinnikov curve passing through the 3n points
(-1: alpha_i^2:0), (0:-1:beta_i^2) and (gamma_i^2:0:-1). Knutson and Tao proved
that another equivalent condition for such A, B and C to exist is that there is
a hive (defined within) whose boundary is (log alpha, log beta, log gamma). The
logarithms of the coefficients of F approximately form such a hive; this leads
to a new proof of Knutson and Tao's result. This paper uses no representation
theory and essentially no symplectic geometry. In their place, it uses Viro's
patchworking method and a topological description of Vinnikov curves.

is a stochastic process which takes values in the space $\Gamma$ of all locally
finite subsets (configurations) in $\Bbb R$ and which has a Gibbs measure $\mu$
as an invariant measure. We assume that $\mu$ corresponds to a symmetric pair
potential $\phi(x-y)$. An important class of stochastic dynamics of a classical
continuous system is formed by diffusions. Till now, only one type of such
dynamics--the so-called gradient stochastic dynamics, or interacting Brownian
particles--has been investigated. By using the theory of Dirichlet forms, we
construct and investigate a new type of stochastic dynamics, which we call
infinite interacting diffusion particles. We introduce a Dirichlet form ${\cal
E}_\mu^\Gamma$ on $L^2(\Gamma;\mu)$, and under general conditions on the
potential $\phi$, prove its closability. For a potential $\phi$ having a
``weak'' singularity at zero, we also write down an explicit form of the
generator of ${\cal E}_\mu^\Gamma$ on the set of smooth cylinder functions. We
then show that, for any Dirichlet form ${\cal E}_\mu^\Gamma$, there exists a
diffusion process that is properly associated with it. Finally, we study a
scaling limit of interacting diffusions in terms of convergence of the
corresponding Dirichlet forms, and we also show that these scaled processes are
tight in $C([0,\infty),{\cal D}')$, where ${\cal D}'$ is the dual space of

time-delay that takes into account the finite velocity of propagation of

element sees all other elements in its current, present state [Physica A {\bf

the effects of in-homogeneities, both in the individual maps, which are
non-identical maps evolving in period-2 orbits, and in the connection links,
which have non-uniform strengths. We find that the global synchronization
regime occurring for strong coupling is robust to heterogeneities: for strong
enough average coupling the inhomogeneous array still synchronizes in a global
state in which each element sees the other elements in positions close to its
current state. However, the clustering behaviour occurring for small coupling
is sensitive to inhomogeneities and differs from that occurring in the
homogeneous array.

left-handed material (LHM) slab. For a line source, a geometric explanation to
the reason of the thickness limitation on an ideal slab is given. For a lossy
slab, the imaging properties are determined by the wavelength, the slab
thickness, the distance from the source to the nearer boundary of the slab, and
the absorption effect. Varying the ratios between these quantities, the image
width can be changed from wavelength to subwavelength scale. In the former
situation, the energy density is mainly concentrated at the two image spots. In
the later case, though image of subwavelength width appears on the focal plane,
however, most energy is located at about the two boundaries of the slab, and
beyond the boundaries the wave amplitude decays exponentially. The relations
between the subwavelength imaging and uncertainty principle is also discussed.

terms of stability in presence of explicitly treated residual terms, as it
inevitably occurs in the reality of NWP. This sudy is restricted to the impact
of thermal and baric residual terms (metric residual terms linked to the
orography are not considered here). It is shown that conversely to what occurs
with Hydrostatic Primitive Equations, the choice of the prognostic variables
used to solve the system in time is of primary importance for the robustness
with Euler Equations. For an optimal choice of prognostic variables,
unconditionnally stable schemes can be obtained (with respect to the length of
the time-step), but only for a smaller range of reference states than in the
case of Hydrostatic Primitive Equations. This study also indicates that: (i)
vertical coordinates based on geometrical height and on mass behave similarly
in terms of stability for the problems examined here, and (ii) hybrid
coordinates induce an intrinsic instability, the practical importance of which
is however not completely elucidated in the theoretical context of this paper.

Recent experiments have shown that it is possible to reduce the thermal motion

optomechanical sensor based on a high-finesse cavity, and reduced by a feedback
loop. We show that this technique can be extended to lock the mirror at the
quantum level. In gravitational-waves interferometers with Fabry-Perot cavities
in each arms, it is even possible to use a single feedback mechanism to lock
one cavity mirror on the other. This quantum locking greatly improves the
sensitivity of the interferometric measurement. It is furthermore insensitive
to imperfections such as losses in the interferometer.

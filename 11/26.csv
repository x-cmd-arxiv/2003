derived estimates based on the existing rates for the first four ionization

row elements and Fe. For a range of ionization parameter and column density
applicable to the intrinsic absorbers detected in {\it ASCA}, {\it Chandra},

of photoionization models, with and without DR. The results show that the
ionization parameter at which the population of an Fe M-shell ion peakscan
increase in some cases by factor $>$ 2 when these rates are included. More
importantly, there are dramatic changes in the range in ionization parameter
over which individual M-shell ions contain significant fractions of the total
Fe (e.g. $>$ 10%) in the plasma. These results may explain the mismatch between
the range of Fe ionization states detected in the X-ray spectra of Seyferts,
identified by the energies of the M-Shell Unresolved Transition Array, and
those predicted by photoionization models of the X-ray absorbers that reproduce
lines of second and third row elements. The results suggest that care should be
taken in using 3rd and 4th row ions to constrain the physical conditions in
photoionized X-ray plasmas until accurate DR rates are available. This

naively surprising, since a simple estimate of the stellar microlensing rate
gives less than one in four hundred for a flat Omega_Lambda=0.7 cosmology,
whereas one event was seen in about thirty afterglows. Considering baryonic
MACHOs making up half of the baryons in the universe, the microlensing
probability per burst can be roughly 5% for a GRB at redshift z=2. We explore
two effects that may enhance the probability of observing microlensed gamma-ray
burst afterglows: binary lenses and double magnification bias. We find that the
consideration of binary lenses can increase the rate only at the ~15% level. On
the other hand, because gamma-ray bursts for which afterglow observations exist
are typically selected based on fluxes at widely separated wavebands which are
not necessarily well correlated (e.g. localization in X-ray, afterglow in
optical/infrared), magnification bias can operate at an enhanced level compared
to the usual single-bias case. We find that existing estimates of the slope of
the luminosity function of gamma-ray bursts, while as yet quite uncertain,
point to enhancement factors of more than three above the simple estimates of
the microlensing rate. We find that the probability to observe at least one
microlensing event in the sample of 27 measured afterglows can be 3-4% for
stellar lenses, or as much as 25 Omega_lens for baryonic MACHOs. We note that
the probability to observe at least one event over the available sample of
afterglows is significant only if a large fraction of the baryons in the
universe are condensed in stellar-mass objects. (ABRIDGED)

agree with the characteristic ages of the (proposed) associated magnetars. We
show quantitatively that, by taking into account the energy injected on the
supernova remnant by magnetar spin-down, a faster expansion results, improving
matches between characteristic ages and supernova remnants ages. However, the
magnetar velocities inferred from observations would inviabilize some
associations. Since characteristic ages may not be good age estimators, their
influence on the likelihood of the association may not be as important.
  In this work we present simple numerical simulations of supernova remnants
expansion with internal magnetars, and apply it to the observed objects. A
short initial spin period, thought to be important for the very generation of
the magnetic field, is also relevant for the modified expansion of the remnant.
We next analyze all proposed associations case-by-case, addressing the
likelyhood of each one, according to this perspective. We consider a larger

Kepler orbits dispersed in eccentricity and orientation, using an approximate
phase-space distribution function written in terms of the integrals of motion

abandoning the idea of a preferred reference frame, the ether, and for
replacing Lorentzian Relativity with Einstein's Special Relativity. However,
our re-analysis of the Michelson-Morley original data, consistently with the
point of view already expressed by other authors, shows that the experimental
observations have been misinterpreted. Namely, the fringe shifts point to a
non-zero observable Earth's velocity v_obs = 8.4 +/- 0.5 km/s. Assuming the
existence of a preferred reference frame, and using Lorentz transformations to
extract the kinematical Earth's velocity that corresponds to this v_obs, we
obtain a real velocity, in the plane of the interferometer, v_earth = 201 +/-
12 km/s. This value is in excellent agreement with Miller's calculated value
v_earth = 203 +/- 8 km/s and suggests that the magnitude of the fringe shifts
is determined by the typical velocity of the Solar System within our galaxy.
This conclusion, which is also consistent with the results of all other
classical experiments, leads to an alternative interpretation of the
Michelson-Morley type of experiments. Contrary to the generally accepted ideas
of last century, they provide experimental evidence for the existence of a
preferred reference frame. This point of view is also consistent with the most
recent data for the anisotropy of the two-way speed of light in the vacuum.

temperature fluctuations should be Gaussian. However, non-Gaussian signatures
can be present. They might have different origins and thus different
statistical and morphological characteristics.
  In this context and motivated by recent and future CMB experiments, we search
for, and discriminate between, different non-Gaussian signatures. We analyse
simulated maps of three cosmological sources of temperature anisotropies:
Gaussian distributed CMB anisotropies from inflation, temperature fluctuations
from cosmic strings and anisotropies due to the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)
effect both showing a non-Gaussian character. We use different multi-scale
methods, namely, wavelet, ridgelet and curvelet transforms. The sensitivity and
the discriminating power of the methods is evaluated using simulated data sets.
  We find that the bi-orthogonal wavelet transform is the most powerful for the
detection of non-Gaussian signatures and that the curvelet and ridgelet
transforms characterise quite precisely and exclusively the cosmic strings.
They allow us thus to detect them in a mixture of CMB + SZ + cosmic strings. We
show that not one method only should be applied to understand non-Gaussianity
but rather a set of different robust and complementary methods should be used.

does not vanish at zero drive, making the system non-conservative also in

excellent. Within the scheme a resonant valence bond (RVB) wavefunction is
found at half-filling to be lower in energy than the antiferromagnetic state.
If the wavefunction is expressed in fermion operators, local SU(2) and U(l)

most other debuggers did not: the ability to jump back to a previous state of

examine in detail a part of the computation that they previously stepped over.
Unfortunately, it also creates a problem: while the debugger may be able to
restore the previous values of variables, it cannot restore the part of the
program's state that is affected by I/O operations. If the part of the
computation being jumped back over performs I/O, then the program will perform
these I/O operations twice, which will result in unwanted effects ranging from
the benign (e.g. output appearing twice) to the fatal (e.g. trying to close an
already closed file). We present a simple mechanism for ensuring that every I/O
action called for by the program is executed at most once, even if the
programmer asks the debugger to travel back in time from after the action to
before the action. The overhead of this mechanism is low enough and can be
controlled well enough to make it practical to use it to debug computations
that do significant amounts of I/O.

Collider Detector at Fermilab, consists of events with two or more jets with
transverse energy $E_T \geq 15$ GeV and pseudo-rapidity $|\eta| \leq 1.5$. The
heavy flavor content of the data set is enriched by requiring that at least one
of the jets (lepton-jet) contains a lepton with transverse momentum larger than
8 GeV/c. Jets containing hadrons with heavy flavor are selected via the
identification of secondary vertices.
  The parton-level cross sections predicted by the {\sc herwig} Monte Carlo
generator program are tuned within theoretical and experimental uncertainties
to reproduce the secondary-vertex rates in the data.
  The tuned simulation provides new information on the origin of the
discrepancy between the $b\bar{b}$ cross section measurements at the Tevatron
and the next-to-leading order QCD prediction. We also compare the rate of
away-jets (jets recoiling against the lepton-jet) containing a soft lepton
($p_T \geq 2$ GeV/c) in the data to that in the tuned simulation.
  We find that this rate is larger than what is expected for the conventional
production and semileptonic decay of pairs of hadrons with heavy flavor.

Calculations show that there are no convincing candidates for the nonexotic
members of the anti-decuplet available in the baryon listings. Up to the
leading order of $m_s$ and 1/$N_c$, the width formula for the decay of the
anti-decuplet baryons to the octet depends only on SU(3) symmetry

have an anti-decuplet with negative parity and that the masses are the same as
those given by chiral soltion models, the identification of N(1650) as
$N_{\bar{10}}$ are inconsistent with experiments for $N(1650)\to N\pi$ while
the widths agree with other two decay channels involving strangeness. And

form factors is reduced to a smaller number of universal form factors up to
hard-scattering corrections. In this paper we extend our previous investigation
of heavy-to-light currents in soft-collinear effective theory to final states
with invariant mass Lambda^2 as is appropriate to exclusive B meson decays. The
effective theory contains soft modes and two collinear modes with virtualities
of order m_b*Lambda (`hard-collinear') and Lambda^2. Integrating out the
hard-collinear modes results in the hard spectator-scattering contributions to
exclusive B decays. We discuss the representation of heavy-to-light currents in
the effective theory after integrating out the hard-collinear scale, and show
that the previously conjectured factorization formula is valid to all orders in
perturbation theory. The naive factorization of matrix elements in the
effective theory into collinear and soft matrix elements may be invalidated by
divergences in convolution integrals. In the factorization proof we circumvent
the explicit regularization of endpoint divergences by a definition of the
universal form factors that includes hard-collinear, collinear and soft

two causally connected conformal boundaries, each of which is a ``null
cylinder'', namely a cylinder with a null direction identified. This spacetime
arises from three different perspectives: (i) as a non-singular, causally
regular orbifold of global AdS_3 by boosts, (ii) as a Penrose-like limit
focusing on the horizon of extremal BTZ black holes, and (iii) as an S^1
fibration over AdS_2. Each of these perspectives sheds an interesting light on
holography. Examination of the conformal boundary of the spacetime shows that
the dual to the space should involve DLCQ limits of the D1-D5 conformal field
theory. The Penrose-like limit approach leads to a similar conclusion, by
isolating a sector of the complete D1-D5 CFT that describes the physics in the
vicinity of the horizon of an extremal black hole. As such this is a
holographic description of the universal horizon dynamics of the extremal black
holes in AdS_3 and also of the four and five dimensional stringy black holes
whose states were counted in string theory. The AdS_2 perspective draws a
connection to a 0+1d quantum mechanical theory. Various dualities lead to a
Matrix model description of the spacetime. Many interesting issues that are
related to both de Sitter physics and attempts to ``see behind a horizon''
using AdS/CFT arise from (a) the presence of two disconnected components to the
boundary, and (b) the analytic structure of bulk physics in the complex
coordinate plane.

order derivatives are fractional derivatives that have been integrated over the
order of the derivative within a given range. In this paper sub-diffusive cases
are considered. That is, the order of the time derivative ranges from zero to
one. The equation is solved for Dirichlet, Neumann, and Cauchy boundary

These `elementary' relations can be subtle: for instance, there is a planar

solutions to Schr\""{o}dinger's equation are used to investigate the issue of
the tunneling time in rectangular potential barriers. In general, a time
frequency analysis shows that these transients have frequencies above the
cutoff frequency associated with the barrier height, and hence correspond to
non-tunneling processes. We find, however, a regime characterized by the
barrier opacity, where the peak maximum $t_{max}$ of the {\it time-domain
resonance} corresponds to under-the-barrier tunneling. We argue that $t_{max}$
represents the relevant tunneling time scale through the classically forbidden
region.

degrees of freedom, which we believe are poorly understood as compared with
small systems and infinite systems. We focus on pure states that do not have
the `cluster property.' Such a pure state is entangled macroscopically, and is
quite anomalous in view of many-body physics because it does not approach any
pure state in the infinite-size limit. However, we often encounter such
anomalous states when studying finite macroscopic systems, such as quantum
computers with many qubits and finite systems that will exhibit symmetry
breaking in the infinite-size limit. We study stabilities of such anomalous
states in general systems. In contrast to the previous works, we obtain general
and universal results, by making full use of the locality of the theory. Using
the general results, we discuss roles of anomalous states in quantum computers,
and the mechanism of emergence of a classical world from quantum theory.

the magnetic dipolar coupling between two neighboring fullerenes, the two-qubit

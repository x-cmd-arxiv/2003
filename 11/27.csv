specifically to RX J1347-1145 at z=0.451, the most X-ray-luminous galaxy
cluster known, for which the highest resolution SZE and X-ray images are
currently available. We demonstrate that the combined analysis yields a unique
probe of complex structures in the intracluster medium, offering determinations
of their temperature, density, and line-of-sight extent. For a subclump in RX
J1347-1145, previously discovered in our SZE map, the temperature inferred
after removing the foreground and background components is well in excess of 20
keV, indicating that the cluster has recently undergone a violent merger.
Excluding the region around this subclump, the SZE signals in submillimeter to
centimeter bands (350, 150, and 21 GHz) are all consistent with those expected
from Chandra X-ray observations. We further present a temperature deprojection
technique based on the SZE and X-ray images, without any knowledge of spatially
resolved X-ray spectroscopy. The methodology presented here will be applicable
to a statistical sample of clusters available in the future SZE surveys.

H emission indicates an interaction between the expanding SN ejecta and an

SNe 1997cy and 1999E. The three SNe also have similar luminosities, suggesting
that they are the same phenomenon and that the CSM is also similar. We propose
a new classification, Type IIa SNe, for these events. The observed line

the optical emission out to a radius of about 7' at both wavelengths. For a
detailed analysis, we carefully subtracted the line contributions and
synchrotron and free-free emission from the data, which added up to 6% at
1.23mm and 10% at 0.87mm. We combined the flux densities with FIR data to
obtain dust spectra and calculate dust temperatures, absorption cross sections,
and masses. Assuming a ``standard'' dust model, which consists of two
populations of big grains at moderate and warm temperatures, we obtained
temperatures of 18K and 50K for the both components. However, such a model
suffers from an excess of the radiation at 1.23mm, and the dust absorption
cross section seems to be enhanced by a factor 3 compared to previous results
and theoretical expectations. At large galactocentric radii, where the galaxy
shows disturbances as a result of gravitational interaction, this effect seems
to be even stronger. Some possibilities to resolve these problems are
discussed. The data could be explained by a very cold dust component at a
temperature of 4-6K, an increased abundance of very small grains, or a
component of grains with unusual optical properties. We favour the latter
possibility, since the first two lead to inconsistencies.

realistic dust grain models. For resolved disks, we find that different objects
require very different dust grain properties in order to simultaneously fit the
image data and SED. Fomalhaut and Vega require solid dust grains, whilst HR4796
and HD141569 can only be fitted using porous grains. The older stars tend to
have less porous grains than younger stars, which may indicate that collisions
have compacted the dust grains. Eps Eri appears to be deficient in small dust
grains compared to our best fitting model. This may be due to factors which
affect the size distribution of grains close to the radiation pressure blowout
limit. Alternatively, this discrepancy may be due to some external influence on
the disk (e.g. a planet). When the model is applied to unresolved targets, an
estimate of the disk size can be made. However, the large diversity in dust
composition for the resolved disks means that we cannot make a reliable
assumption as to the composition of the grains in an unresolved disk, and there
is corresponding uncertainty in the disk size. In addition, the poor fit for
Eps Eri shows that the model cannot always account for the SED even if the disk
size is known. These two factors mean that it may not be possible to determine
a disk's size without actually resolving it.

interaction of the dark matter particles with the stars are solved. Scattering
of dark matter particles by stars would substantially lower the dark matter
density near the GC SBH over 10^10 yr, due both to kinetic heating, and to
capture of dark matter particles by the SBH. This result suggests that
enhancements in the dark matter density around a SBH would be modest whether or
not the host galaxy had experienced the scouring effects of a binary SBH.

correlated pumping phenomena incorporating spin rotation in wave functions into

illustrate spin pumping in a few models where various spin configurations or
topological motors drive adiabatic pumps. In the Rashba model we find that a
topological spin pump is driven by a meron with positive one half skyrmion
charge, the size of which can be controlled by external gates or Zeeman fields.
In the Dresselhaus model on the other hand, electron spins are pumped out by a
negative meron. We examine effects of Zeeman fields on topological spin pumping
and responses of fermi seas in various pumps. The phenomena of topological
pumping are attributed to topological Stern-Gerlach splitting and occur in a
transverse direction along which charge pumping currents either vanish or are
negligible. The transport equations established here might also be applied for
the studies of anomalous Hall effect and spin Hall effect as demonstrated in

exponential, are due to the reduction of nondeterminism and to the fact that
the computations which are performed by the initial programs in different
branches of the computation trees, are performed by the specialized programs
within single branches. In order to reduce nondeterminism we also make use of

rotation assists the collapse, while shear-like distortions in the distribution
of the field's gradients resist contraction. We also show that the relativistic
coupling between magnetism and geometry, together with the tension properties
of the field, lead to a magneto-curvature stress that opposes the collapse.
This tension stress grows stronger with increasing curvature distortion, which
means that it could potentially dominate over the gravitational pull of the
matter. If this happens, a converging family of non-geodesic lines can be
prevented from focusing without violating the standard energy conditions.

drive it to prescribed values of its mass, charge and angular momentum without
the need to repeatedly measure mass or angular momentum throughout the process.
I describe the mechanism, which is based on Zel'dovich-Misner superradiance and
its analog for charged black holes. It represents a possible step in the
development of preparation procedures for quantum black holes.

immersed in an external electromagnetic field, described by an exact solution
of the Einstein-Maxwell equations found by Ernst (the ``Schwarzschild-Melvin''
metric). Following the classical method of Aichelburg and Sexl, the
gravitational field generated by a black hole moving ``with the speed of
light'' and the transformed electromagnetic field are determined. The
corresponding exact solution describes an impulsive gravitational wave
propagating in the static, cylindrically symmetric, electrovac universe of
Melvin, and for a vanishing electromagnetic field it reduces to the well known
Aichelburg-Sexl pp-wave. In the boosting process, the original Petrov type I of
the Schwarzschild-Melvin solution simplifies to the type II on the impulse, and
to the type D elsewhere. The geometry of the wave front is studied, in
particular its non-constant Gauss curvature. In addition, a more general class
of impulsive waves in the Melvin universe is constructed by means of a
six-dimensional embedding formalism adapted to the background. A coordinate
system is also presented in which all the impulsive metrics take a continuous
form. Finally, it is shown that these solutions are a limiting case of a family
of exact gravitational waves with an arbitrary profile. This family is
identified with a solution previously found by Garfinkle and Melvin. We thus
complement their analysis, in particular demonstrating that such spacetimes are
of type II and belong to the Kundt class.

for both the hardening of the spectra for low transverse momenta (Cronin

formed hadrons are found to be negligible in central Au+Au collisions at
sqrt{s}=200 GeV for pT\geq 6 GeV/c, but have some importance for the shape of
the ratio R_{AA} at lower pT values (\leq 6 GeV/c). The large suppression seen
experimentally is attributed to the inelastic interactions of 'leading'

pole term and the vector meson exchange in the $t$-channel. To explain the
observed energy dependence of the integrated cross section, two $s$ -wave

of a vigorous shaking, the bimolecular rate of the reaction exceeds the

renaturation in these conditions is known as the Phenol Emulsion Reassociation

comparison of this interfacial reaction with other approaches shows that PERT
is the most efficient technique and reveals similarities between PERT and the
renaturation performed by single-stranded nucleic acid binding proteins. Our
results lead to a better understanding of the partitioning of nucleic acids in

  13-15 October 2003",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Most modern classical processors support so-called von Neumann architecture
with program and data registers. In present work is revisited similar approach
to models of quantum processors. Deterministic programmable quantum gate arrays
are considered as an example. They are also called von Neumann quantum
processors here and use conditional quantum dynamics. Such devices have some
problems with universality, but consideration of hybrid quantum processors,
i.e., models with both continuous and discrete quantum variables resolves the
problems. It is also discussed comparison of such a model of quantum processors
with more traditional approach.

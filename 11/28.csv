Modeling photoionized plasmas in attempt to match the observed silicon and

this feature. It is suggested that the discrepancy is due to underestimation of
the low-temperature dielectronic recombination rates for iron M-shell ions.
Modified ionization balance calculations, based on new (guessed) atomic data,
support this idea. The results are shown and compared to the global properties

energetic processing of interstellar ice mantles. This interpretation is based
on the excellent fit with OCN-, which is readily formed by ultraviolet (UV) or
ion-irradiation of ices containing H2O, CO and NH3. However, the assignment
requires both qualitative and quantitative agreement in terms of the efficiency
of formation as well as the formation of additional products. Here, we present
the first quantitative results on the efficiency of laboratory formation of
OCN- from ices composed of different combinations of H2O, CO, CH3OH, HNCO and
NH3 by UV- and thermally-mediated solid state chemistry. Our results show large
implications for the use of the 4.62 micron feature as a diagnostic for
energetic ice-processing. UV-mediated formation of OCN- from H2O/CO/NH3 ice
matrices falls short in reproducing the highest observed interstellar
abundances. In this case, at most 2.7% OCN- is formed with respect to H2O under
conditions that no longer apply to a molecular cloud environment. On the other
hand, photoprocessing and in particular thermal processing of solid HNCO in the
presence of NH3 are very efficient OCN- formation mechanisms, converting
60%--85% and ~100%, respectively of the original HNCO. We propose that OCN- is
most likely formed thermally from HNCO given the ease and efficiency of this
mechanism. Upper limits on solid HNCO and the inferred interstellar ice
temperatures are in agreement with this scenario.

time-dependent, axisymmetric simulations of the runaway instability of
non-constant angular momentum thick discs around black holes. This second paper
extends earlier results where only constant angular momentum discs were
considered. All relevant aspects of the theory of stationary thick discs around
rotating black holes, necessary to build the initial state in our simulations,
are presented in great detail. The angular momentum of the discs is assumed to
increase outwards with the radial distance according to a power law. The main
simplifying assumptions of our approach are not to include magnetic fields and
self-gravity in the discs. Furthermore, the dynamics of the spacetime is
accounted for by computing the transfer of mass and angular momentum from the
disc to the black hole through the event horizon : the evolution of the central
black hole is assumed to follow a sequence of Kerr black holes of increasing
mass and spin. In agreement with previous results based on stationary models we
find that by allowing the mass and the spin of the black hole to grow, constant
angular momentum discs rapidly become unstable on a dynamical timescale. The
comparison with the results of paper I shows that the effect of the angular
momentum transfer from the torus to the black hole is to make constant angular
momentum discs less unstable, increasing the timescale of the instability.
However, we find that non-constant angular momentum discs are dramatically
stabilized for very small values of the angular momentum slope. Our
time-dependent simulations confirm, thus, the predictions of stationary studies
concerning the stabilizing effect of non-constant angular momentum
distributions.

of supermassive black holes (BH) by comparing the mass function of black holes
in the local universe with that expected from AGN relics, which are black holes
grown entirely with mass accretion during AGN phases. The local BH mass
function (BHMF) is estimated by applying the well-known correlations between BH
mass, bulge luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and
velocity functions. The density of BH's in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;
+1.9) (h/0.7)^2 10^5 Msun Mpc^-3. The relic BHMF is derived from the continuity
equation with the only assumption that AGN activity is due to accretion onto
massive BH's and that merging is not important. We find that the relic BHMF at
z=0 is generated mainly at z<3. Moreover, the BH growth is anti-hierarchical in
the sense that smaller BH's (MBH< 10^7 Msun) grow at lower redshifts (z<1) with
respect to more massive one's (z~1-3). Unlike previous work, we find that the
BHMF of AGN relics is perfectly consistent with the local BHMF indicating the
local BH's were mainly grown during AGN activity. This agreement is obtained
while satisfying, at the same time, the constraints imposed from the X-ray
background. The comparison with the local BHMF also suggests that the merging
process is not important in shaping the relic BHMF, at least at low redshifts
(z<3). Our analysis thus suggests the following scenario: local black holes
grew during AGN phases in which accreting matter was converted into radiation
with efficiencies epsilon = 0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda =
0.1-1.7 of the Eddington luminosity. The average total lifetime of these active
phases ranges from ~4.5 10^8 yr for MBH< 10^8 Msun to ~1.5 10^8 yr for MBH>

magnetohydrodynamic equations as well as all usual assumptions are then clearly
listed. The relevant physical mechanisms of steady-state accretion and ejection
from Keplerian discs are explained in a model independent way. The results of

some of the points from the first one because of large uncertainties and thus
consists of 142 points. The third data set is obtained from the second by
adding the latest 14 points observed through HST. A careful comparison of these
different data sets help us to draw the following conclusions: (i) All the data
sets strongly rule out non-accelerating models. Interestingly, the first and
the second sets favour a closed universe; i.e., the probability P(Omega_{tot} >
1) \gtrsim 0.97. Hence these sets are in mild disagreement with the
``concordance'' flat model. However, this disagreement is reduced
[P(Omega_{tot} > 1) \approx 0.9] for the third data set, which includes the
points observed by HST around 1 < z < 1.6. (ii) When the first data set is
divided into two separate subsets consisting of low (z < 0.34) and high (z >
0.34) redshift supernova, it turns out that these two subsets, individually,
admit non-accelerating models. However, these models seem to be ruled out using
only the low redshift data for the other two data sets, which have less
uncertainties. (iii) It is quite difficult to measure the evolution of the dark
energy equation of state w_X though its present value can be constrained quite
well. The best-fit value seems to mildly favour a dark energy component with
current equation of state w_X < -1, thus opening the possibility of existence
of more exotic forms of matter. However, the data is still consistent with the
the standard cosmological constant at 99% confidence level (abridged).

role. Indeed, they probably help or even channel the initial gravitational
collapse of the parent molecular cloud. But their most spectacular effect is
certainly the production of ubiquitous, powerful, bipolar self-collimated jets.
Also, in the last decade, evidence has come that in such systems a
magnetosphere links the protostar to its surrounding accretion disc.
  I will first briefly review the magnetohydrodynamic models of jets from young
stars. Then, I will discuss some constraints on the magnetospheric interaction
since accretion must proceed despite strong stellar magnetic fields. Finally, I
will introduce the ""Reconnection X-wind"" scenario that leads to episodic jet

dependence of the opacity is confirmed and for a few stars extended to
significantly longer wavelengths. For any plausible dust properties, this
requires grain growth from interstellar sizes to maximum sizes of at least a

the stars (HD34282, HD163296, CQ Tau, TW Hya), the millimeter emission has been
spatially resolved, and the large disk radii ($>100$ AU) rule out that high
optical depths play a role. The mass of dust that has been processed into large
grains is substantial, and in some cases implies a disk mass comparable to the
mass of the central star.

We present here a systematic study of these dips in a variety of contacts
between different combinations of a superconductor and a normal metal. From the
correlation between the characteristics of these dips with the contact area, we
can surmise that such dips are caused by the contact not being in the ballistic
limit. An analysis of the possible errors introduced while analysing such a

  has been submitted to the conference KR'2004",,,,"cs.AI",,"  We consider the integration of existing cone-shaped and projection-based
calculi of cardinal direction relations, well-known in QSR. The more general,
integrating language we consider is based on convex constraints of the
qualitative form $r(x,y)$, $r$ being a cone-shaped or projection-based cardinal
direction atomic relation, or of the quantitative form $(\alpha ,\beta)(x,y)$,
with $\alpha ,\beta\in [0,2\pi)$ and $(\beta -\alpha)\in [0,\pi ]$: the meaning
of the quantitative constraint, in particular, is that point $x$ belongs to the
(convex) cone-shaped area rooted at $y$, and bounded by angles $\alpha$ and
$\beta$. The general form of a constraint is a disjunction of the form
$[r_1\vee...\vee r_{n_1}\vee (\alpha_1,\beta_1)\vee...\vee (\alpha
_{n_2},\beta_{n_2})](x,y)$, with $r_i(x,y)$, $i=1... n_1$, and $(\alpha
_i,\beta_i)(x,y)$, $i=1... n_2$, being convex constraints as described above:
the meaning of such a general constraint is that, for some $i=1... n_1$,
$r_i(x,y)$ holds, or, for some $i=1... n_2$, $(\alpha_i,\beta_i)(x,y)$ holds. A
conjunction of such general constraints is a $\tcsp$-like CSP, which we will
refer to as an $\scsp$ (Spatial Constraint Satisfaction Problem). An effective
solution search algorithm for an $\scsp$ will be described, which uses (1)
constraint propagation, based on a composition operation to be defined, as the
filtering method during the search, and (2) the Simplex algorithm, guaranteeing
completeness, at the leaves of the search tree. The approach is particularly
suited for large-scale high-level vision, such as, e.g., satellite-like
surveillance of a geographic area.

relationship between fluents and evolution: since not all fluents contribute to
systems' evolution and some fluents can be derived from some others, we define
those fluents that are sufficient and necessary to determine evolutional
potential as decisive fluents, and then we prove that their successor states
wrt to deterministic complex actions satisfy Markov property. Then, within the
calculus framework we build, we introduce validity theory to model the
autonomous services with application-specific validity requirements, including:
validity fluents to axiomatize validity requirements, heuristic multiple
alternative service choices ranging from complete acceptance, partial
acceptance, to complete rejection, and validity-ensured policy to comprise such
alternative service choices into organic, autonomously-computable services. Our

in FRGG model have $N^*$ times smaller magnetic charge than in the SM, where
$N^*=N(N+1)/2$. These monopoles can appear at the high energies in the

the gauge theory reduces to non-supersymmetric, four-dimensional QCD with N_c
colours and N_f << N_c flavours. As expected, this decoupling is not fully
realised within the supergravity/Born--Infeld approximation. For N_f = 1 and
massless quarks, m_q = 0, we exhibit spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking by a
quark condensate, <\bar{psi} \psi> \neq 0, and find the associated massless
`pion' in the spectrum. The latter becomes massive for m_q > 0, obeying the
Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner relation: M_pi^2= - m_q <\bar{psi} \psi> / \f_pi^2. In
the case N_f > 1 we provide a holographic version of the Vafa--Witten theorem,
which states that the U(N_f) flavour symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken.
Further we find N_f^2 - 1 unexpectedly light pseudo-scalar mesons in the
spectrum. We argue that these are not (pseudo) Goldstone bosons and speculate
on the string mechanism responsible for their lightness. We then study the

interactions including gravity. It has an extremely difficult dynamics.
Therefore, it is useful to study some its simplifications. One of them is
non-critical string theory which can be defined in low dimensions. A particular
interesting case is 2D string theory. On the one hand, it has a very rich
structure and, on the other hand, it is solvable. A complete solution of 2D
string theory in the simplest linear dilaton background was obtained using its
representation as Matrix Quantum Mechanics. This matrix model provides a very
powerful technique and reveals the integrability hidden in the usual CFT
formulation.
  This thesis extends the matrix model description of 2D string theory to
non-trivial backgrounds. We show how perturbations changing the background are
incorporated into Matrix Quantum Mechanics. The perturbations are integrable
and governed by Toda Lattice hierarchy. This integrability is used to extract
various information about the perturbed system: correlation functions,
thermodynamical behaviour, structure of the target space. The results
concerning these and some other issues, like non-perturbative effects in
non-critical string theory, are presented in the thesis.

p-p interaction strengths) and is determined by a specific energy-weighted sum
rule. The sum rule depends only on the particle-particle residual interaction
(being linear function of $g'_{pp}$ in the QRPA) and passes through zero at the

mainly determined by the intensity of the spin-orbit interaction of the nuclear

grating amplitude on the extremely asymmetrical scattering (EAS) of bulk and
guided optical modes in non-uniform strip-like periodic Bragg arrays with
stepwise and gradual variations in the grating amplitude across the array. A
recently developed new approach based on allowance for the diffractional
divergence of the scattered wave is used for this analysis. It is demonstrated
that gradual variations in magnitude of the grating amplitude may change the
pattern of EAS noticeably but not radically. On the other hand, phase
variations in the grating may result in a radically new type of Bragg
scattering - double-resonant EAS (DEAS). In this case, a combination of two
strong simultaneous resonances (one with respect to frequency, and another with
respect to the phase variation) is predicted to take place in non-uniform
arrays with a step-like phase and gradual magnitude variations of the grating
amplitude. The tolerances of EAS and DEAS to small gradual variations in the
grating amplitude are determined. The main features of these types of
scattering in non-uniform arrays are explained by the diffractional divergence
of the scattered wave inside and outside the array.

"physics/0311139","Luis L. Sanchez. Soto","R. Alvargonzalez","Interactions between Zero-Point Radiation and Electrons","New version.Typos fixed. Comments welcome. 13 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Knowing the magnitude of the energy flow inherent to zero-point radiation
allows us to approach the question of its possible interaction with particles
of matter. Its photons are not different from the rest, and must in principle
be subject to the Compton effect and the Klein-Nishima-Tann formula for its
cross section. On this assumption, it is shown here that zero-point radiation
may be powerful enough to explain Poincar\'e's tensions and to supply an
efficient cause for gravitation. This could be only the case if the classic
radius of the electron measures $8.143375\times10^{20}q_\la$, where $q_\la$ is
the minimum wavelength for electromagnetic radiation, and if the wavelength of
the most energetic photon in the actual zero-point radiation is
$5.275601\times10^{27}q_\la$. To the first of these numbers there corresponds
the energy $3.5829 \times10^{23}$ MeV for the photon whose wavelength is
$1q_\la$. This gives also the relation $q_\la=(2 \pi \al)^{1/2}L_P$, where
$L_P$ is the Planck Length. Finally the relation between the force of gravity
and the electrostatic force is explained by the equations obtained in this
paper.

  print",,"10.1080/09500340408233606",,"quant-ph",,"  The dynamical properties of a quantum system can be profoundly influenced by
its environment. Usually, the environment provokes decoherence and its action
on the system can often be schematized by adding a noise term in the
Hamiltonian. However, other scenarios are possible: we show that by increasing
the strength of the noise, the Hilbert space of the system gradually splits
into invariant subspaces, among which transitions become increasingly
difficult. The phenomenon is equivalent to the formation of the quantum Zeno
subspaces. We explore the possibility that noise can {\em prevent}, rather than
provoke decoherence.

magnetic microchip trap. Coherence lifetimes exceeding 1 s are observed with
atoms at distances of $5-130 \mu$m from the microchip surface. The coherence
lifetime in the chip trap is independent of atom-surface distance within our
measurement accuracy, and agrees well with the results of similar measurements
in macroscopic magnetic traps. Due to the absence of surface-induced
decoherence, a miniaturized atomic clock with a relative stability in the
$10^{-13}$ range can be realized. For applications in quantum information
processing, we propose to use microwave near-fields in the proximity of chip
wires to create potentials that depend on the internal state of the atoms.

its imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background through resonant scattering of
CMB photons by atoms, ions and molecules. These transitions partially erase
original temperature anisotropies of the CMB, and also generate new
fluctuations. In this paper we propose a method to determine the abundance of
these heavy species in low density (over-densities less than $10^4-10^5$)
optically thin regions of the universe by using the unprecedented sensitivity
of current and future CMB experiments. In particular, we focus our analysis on
the sensitivity of the PLANCK HFI detectors in four spectral bands. We also
present results for l=220 and 810 which are of interest for balloon and
ground-based instruments, like ACT, APEX and SPT. We use the fine-structure
transitions of atoms and ions as a source of frequency dependent optical depth
($\tau_{\nu}$). These transitions give different contributions to the power
spectrum of CMB in different observing channels. By comparing results from
those channels, it is possible to {\it avoid} the limit imposed by the cosmic
variance and to extract information about the abundance of corresponding
species at the redshift of scattering. For PLANCK HFI we will be able to get
strong constraints ($10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ solar fraction) on the abundances of
neutral atoms like C, O, Si, S, and Fe in the redshift range 1-50.
Fine-structure transitions of ions like CII, NII or OIII set similar limits in
the very important redshift range 3-25 and can be used to probe the ionization
history of the universe. Foregrounds and other frequency dependent contaminants
may set a serious limitation for this method.

of the mass being transferred and rate of transfer. An absorption lane
typically 0.25"" (100 pc) wide with a representative optical depth tau_B = 0.2
cuts across the spiral structure of NGC 1410, crosses the 7-kpc projected space
between the nuclei, wraps in front of and, at the limits of detection, behind
NGC 1409, and becomes a denser (tau_B = 0.4) polar feature around the core of

three-dimensional recovery of the dust structure, supporting the front/back
geometry derived from colors and extinction estimates. The whole feature
contains of order $10^6$ solar masses in dust, implying about 2x10^7 solar
masses of gas, requiring a mass transfer rate averaging ~1 solar mass per year
unless we are particularly unlucky in viewing angle. Curiously, this
demonstrable case of mass transfer seems to be independent of the occurrence of
a Seyfert nucleus, since the Seyfert galaxy in this pair is the donor of the

incoming gas, although NGC 1410 has numerous luminous young star clusters and

analytic considerations suggest that the inner slope of dark matter halos
cannot be steeper than alpha=2 (rho ~ r^-alpha), with alpha=1.5-1.7 being a
more realistic upper limit. Our analysis suggests that any number of effects,
both real (angular momentum from tidal torques, secondary perturbations) and
artificial (two-body interactions, the accuracy of the numerical integrator,
round-off errors), will result in shallower slopes. We also find that the halos
should exhibit a well-defined relation between r_peri/r_apo and j_theta/j_r. We
derive this relation analytically and speculate that it may be ""universal"".
Using a semi-analytic scheme based on Ryden & Gunn (1987), we further explore
the relationship between the specific angular momentum distribution in a halo
and its density profile. For now we restrict ourselves to halos that form
primarily via nearly-smooth accretion of matter, and only consider the specific
angular momentum generated by secondary perturbations associated with the cold
dark matter spectrum of density fluctuations. Compared to those formed in
N-body simulations, our ``semi-analytic'' halos are more extended, have flatter
rotation curves and have higher specific angular momentum, even though we have
not yet taken into account the effects of tidal torques. Whether the density
profiles of numerical halos is indeed the result of loss in angular momentum
outside the central region, and whether this loss is a feature of hierarchical

of the pair structure, dielectric constant $\eps$ and dynamics as a function of
the ratio $d/\sigma$ ($\sig$ is the molecular diameter), for a fixed dipole
moment $\mu$. The point dipole model is found to agree well with the extended
dipole model up to $d/\sig \simeq 0.3$. Beyond that ratio, $\eps$ shows a
non-trivial variation with $d/\sig$. When $d/\sig>0.6$, a transition is
observed towards a hexagonal columnar phase; the corresponding value of the
dipole moment, $\mu^2/\sig^3 k T=3$, is found to be substantially lower than
the value of the point dipole required to drive a similar transition.

insulators. The first one, proposed recently by Taraskin et al, is a
translationally invariant system, built out of two independent non-overlapping
bands of single-particle orbitals that are coupled by a weak inter-band
hybridization. This kind of insulator exhibits unphysical properties: we show,
in particular, that the one-body density matrix does not depend on the width of
the gap between the bands. Consequently, there is no delocalization effect with
increasing metallicity. In the second model there are also two bands. However,
they are not imposed by construction but are created from a band of
single-particle orbitals due to the breaking of the translational symmetry by a
periodic potential. These bands are separated by a gap for all nonzero values
of the unique energy parameter of the model. We demonstrate that the one-body
density matrix has the same structure as in the first model. As a result, the
large distance asymptotic formulae derived by Taraskin et al in dimensions
$D=1,2,3$, apply as well, but only for very large gap widths. In D=1 and in the
diagonal direction of D=2 cases, we derive a stronger asymptotic formula, valid
for all gap widths. The both kinds of asymptotic formulae are composed of a
dimension-dependent power-law factor and a gap-dependent exponentially decaying
factor. The latter asymptotics implies that the exponential decay rate vanishes
linearly with the vanishing gap. In non-diagonal directions, we have found
numerically that the linear scaling is replaced by the square root one.
Independently of the direction, the exponential decay rate grows
logarithmically with the gap width, for sufficiently large gaps.

set theory, and we investigate the case where this is done using the
wellfoundedness property of sets. Our hypothesis is that non-wellfounded sets
(hypersets) give rise to a different quality of virtual reality than do
familiar wellfounded sets. We initially provide an alternative approach to
virtual reality based on Sommerhoff's idea of first and second order
self-awareness; both categories of self-awareness are considered as necessary
conditions for consciousness in terms of higher cognitive functions. We then
introduce a representation of first and second order self-awareness through
sets, and assume that these sets, which we call events, originally form a
collection of wellfounded sets. Strong virtual reality characterizes virtual
reality environments which have the limited capacity to create only events
associated with wellfounded sets. In contrast, the more general concept of weak
virtual reality characterizes collections of virtual reality mediated events
altogether forming an entirety larger than any collection of wellfounded sets.
By giving reference to Aczel's hyperset theory we indicate that this definition
is not empty, because hypersets encompass wellfounded sets already. Moreover,
we argue that weak virtual reality could be realized in human history through
continued progress in computer technology. Finally, we reformulate our
characterization into a more general framework, and use Baltag's Structural
Theory of Sets (STS) to show that within this general hyperset theory
Sommerhoff's first and second order self-awareness as well as both concepts of
virtual reality admit a consistent mathematical representation.

promising probes of large extra spacetime dimensions. Studies of black holes at
particle colliders have assumed that all of the incoming energy is captured in
the resulting black hole. We incorporate the inelasticity inherent in such
processes and determine the prospects for discovering black holes in colliders
and cosmic ray experiments, employing a dynamical model of Hawking evolution.
At the Large Hadron Collider, inelasticity reduces rates by factors of 10^3 to
10^6 in the accessible parameter space, moderating, but not eliminating, hopes
for black hole discovery. At the Pierre Auger Observatory, rates are suppressed
by a factor of 10. We evaluate the impact of cosmic ray observations on
collider prospects.

When m=2, they are integral liftings of Milnor's invariants \bar\mu(1..12..2)
of even length, including, in the case of \Nabla^*_L, Cochran's derived
invariants \beta^k. The coefficients of \Nabla_L and \Nabla^*_L are closely
related to certain Q-valued invariants of (genuine) finite type, among which we
find alternative extensions \hat\beta^k of \beta^k to the case lk\ne 0, such
that 2\hat\beta^1/lk^2 is the Casson-Walker invariant of the Q-homology sphere
obtained by 0-surgery on the link components.
  Each coefficient of \Nabla^*_L (hence of
\nabla^*_L:=\nabla_L/(\nabla_{K_1}...\nabla_{K_m})) is invariant under TOP
isotopy and under sufficiently close C^0-approximation, and can be extended,
preserving these properties, to all topological links. The same holds for H^*_L
and F^*_L, where H_L and F_L are certain exponential parameterizations of the
two-variable HOMFLY and Kauffman polynomials. Next, we show that no difference
between PL isotopy and TOP isotopy (as equivalence relations on PL links in
S^3) can be detected by finite type invariants. These are corollaries of the
fact that any type k invariant (genuine or Kirk-Livingston), well-defined up to
PL isotopy, assumes same values on k-quasi-isotopic links.

bioinformatical applications. We present a new method for hierarchical
clustering of data called mutual information clustering (MIC) algorithm. It
uses mutual information (MI) as a similarity measure and exploits its grouping
property: The MI between three objects X, Y, and Z is equal to the sum of the
MI between X and Y, plus the MI between Z and the combined object (XY).
  Results: We use this both in the Shannon (probabilistic) version of
information theory, where the ""objects"" are probability distributions
represented by random samples, and in the Kolmogorov (algorithmic) version,
where the ""objects"" are symbol sequences. We apply our method to the
construction of mammal phylogenetic trees from mitochondrial DNA sequences and
we reconstruct the fetal ECG from the output of independent components analysis
(ICA) applied to the ECG of a pregnant woman.
  Availability: The programs for estimation of MI and for clustering
(probabilistic version) are available at

specific value when the phase is measured. This can be done by observing their
decay products in interference. We discuss exactly solvable models for this
process in cases where competing observation channels drive the phases to
different sets of values. We treat the case of two modes which both emit into
the input ports of two beam splitters, and of a linear or circular chain of
modes. In these latter cases, the transitivity of relative phase becomes an
issue.

prove lower bounds of the quantum query complexity of a multiple-block ordered
search problem in which, given a block number i, we are to find a location of a
target keyword in an ordered list of the i-th block. Apart from much studied
polynomial and adversary methods for quantum query complexity lower bounds, our
argument shows that the multiple-block ordered search needs a large number of
nonadaptive oracle queries on a black-box model of quantum computation that is
also supplemented with advice. Our argument is also applied to the notions of
computational complexity theory: quantum truth-table reducibility and quantum
truth-table autoreducibility.

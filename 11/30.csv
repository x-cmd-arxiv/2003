signal from the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen in the
pre-reionization era and to investigate the observability of this signal. We
show that the separation of the mean (global) signal over the whole sky from
the known foreground contamination may be feasible, but very challenging. In
agreement with previous studies, we demonstrate that measuring angular
fluctuations in the HI signal is likely to be extremely difficult if not
impossible because of the overwhelming contamination from the galactic and
extragalactic foregrounds. However,we show that the sharp HI fluctuations in
the frequency domain should be easily separable from the relatively smooth
spectra of the foregrounds, and that these fluctuations should be detectable
even at moderate angular resolution (10-20 arcmin).

is located in the outer-magnetosphere of a pulsar. The charge depletion from
the Goldreich-Julian density causes a large electric field along the magnetic
field lines. The electric field accelerates electrons and positrons to high
energies. We solve the formation of the electric field self-consistently with
the radiation and the pair-creation processes in one-dimensional geometry along
the magnetic field lines, and calculate curvature spectrum to compare with the
observations. We find that because the particles escape from the accelerating
region with large Lorentz factors as $10^{7.5}$, curvature radiation from the
outside of the gap, in which there is no electric field, still has a important
contribution to the spectrum. Including the outside emission, the model spectra
are improved between 100 MeV and 1 GeV for the Vela-type pulsars. Since the
field line curvature close to the light cylinder affects the spectrum in
several hundred MeV, there is a possibility to diagnose the field structure by
using the spectrum in these bands. The difference found in the $\gamma$-ray
spectra of the twin pulsars, PSR B0833-45 (Vela) and B1706-44, is deduced from
the dimensionless electric current running through the gap. The extension to
the three-dimensional modeling with self-consistent electrodynamics is
necessary to understand the difference in the observed flux between the twin
pulsars.

with a scalar field without any potential terms. This field drives inflation
solely by its derivatives, which couple to the matter only through the
combination $\bar g_{\mu\nu} = g_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{m^4} \partial_\mu \phi
\partial_\nu \phi$. The theory is free of instabilities around the usual
Minkowski vacuum. Inflation lasts as long as $\dot \phi^2 > m^4$, and
terminates gracefully once the scalar field kinetic energy drops below $m^4$.
The total number of e-folds is given by the initial inflaton energy $\dot
\phi_0^2$ as ${\cal N} \simeq \frac13 \ln(\frac{\dot \phi_0}{m^2})$. The field
$\phi$ can neither efficiently reheat the universe nor produce the primordial
density fluctuations. However this could be remedied by invoking the curvaton
mechanism. If inflation starts when $\dot \phi^2_0 \sim M^4_P$, and $m \sim
m_{EW} \sim TeV$, the number of e-folds is ${\cal N} \sim 25$. Because the
scale of inflation is low, this is sufficient to solve the horizon problem if
the reheating temperature is $T_{RH} \ga MeV$. In this instance, the leading
order coupling of $\phi$ to matter via a dimension-8 operator
$\frac{1}{m^4}\partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi ~ T^{\mu\nu}$ would lead to
fermion-antifermion annihilation channels $f\bar f \to \phi \phi$ accessible to
the LHC, while yielding very weak corrections to the Newtonian potential and to
supernova cooling rates, that are completely within experimental limits.

the pion self-energy incorporates the s-wave scattering, which requires a more
accurate evaluation. Therefore relativistic approach containing only these
diagrams does not describe appropriately the pion self-energy in isospin
symmetric nuclear matter. We conclude that, a correct relativistic approach to
the pion self-energy should involve a more sophisticated calculation in order
to satisfy the known experimental results on the near-threshold behaviour of
the pion-nucleon (forward) scattering amplitude.

bathochromic pi -> pi* transition of an aromatic chromophore in apolar
environments. As an example, perylene in solid and liquid n-alkane matrices was
chosen, and all shifts are calculated relative to one well-defined
solid-inclusion system. It is shown that a simple two-level treatment of the
solute using Huckel theory yields spectral shifts in excellent agreement with
experimental results for the most prominent inclusion sites of perylene in
solid n-alkane surroundings and for the dilute solutions in liquid n-alkanes.
The idea is general enough to be applied to any aromatic chromophore in a
nonpolar solvent matrix. In contrast to earlier treatments, this approach is
based on geometry-dependent polarizabilities, employs a r^-4 dependence for the
dispersion energy, is conceptually simple and computationally efficient.
Different simple models based on our general approach to compute the UV
spectral shifts due to solvation indicate that the dispersive part of the
van-der-Waals energy, which stabilizes the LUMO of perylene more than the HOMO,
falls off with a distance dependence of r^-4 in a range up to ~1 nm and not as
r^-6, as has been assumed for a long time. This finding corresponds to the
interpretation of temporary dipoles as being equivalent to weak permanent
dipoles with fluctuating orientation.

  Mechanics and Physics of Solids. See journal for final version",,"10.1016/j.jmps.2004.01.004",,"q-bio.QM q-bio.TO",,"  Growth (and resorption) of biological tissue is formulated in the continuum
setting. The treatment is macroscopic, rather than cellular or sub-cellular.
Certain assumptions that are central to classical continuum mechanics are
revisited, the theory is reformulated, and consequences for balance laws and
constitutive relations are deduced. The treatment incorporates multiple
species. Sources and fluxes of mass, and terms for momentum and energy transfer
between species are introduced to enhance the classical balance laws. The
transported species include: (\romannumeral 1) a fluid phase, and
(\romannumeral 2) the precursors and byproducts of the reactions that create
and break down tissue. A notable feature is that the full extent of coupling
between mass transport and mechanics emerges from the thermodynamics.
Contributions to fluxes from the concentration gradient, chemical potential
gradient, stress gradient, body force and inertia have not emerged in a unified
fashion from previous formulations of the problem. The present work
demonstrates these effects via a physically-consistent treatment. The presence
of multiple, interacting species requires that the formulation be consistent
with mixture theory. This requirement has far-reaching consequences. A
preliminary numerical example is included to demonstrate some aspects of the
coupled formulation.

  edited by P. Steinmann and G. A. Maugin, Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.TO",,"  Remodelling of biological tissue, due to changes in microstructure, is
treated in the continuum mechanical setting. Microstructural change is
expressed as an evolution of the reference configuration. This evolution is
expressed as a point-to-point map from the reference configuration to a
remodelled configuration. A ``preferred'' change in configuration is considered
in the form of a globally incompatible tangent map. This field could be
experimentally determined, or specified from other insight. Issues of global
compatibility and evolution equations for the resulting configurations are
addressed. It is hypothesized that the tissue reaches local equilibrium with
respect to changes in microstructure. A governing differential equation and
boundary conditions are obtained for the microstructural changes by posing the
problem in a variational setting. The Eshelby stress tensor, a separate
configurational stress, and thermodynamic driving (material) forces arise in
this formulation, which is recognized as describing a process of self-assembly.
An example is presented to illustrate the theoretical framework.

noninteracting fermions (with Slater determinants as a special example).
Assuming a bounded two-particle interaction, we obtain a bound on the error of
the TDHF approximation, valid for short times. We further show that the error
of the TDHF approximation vanishes at all times in the mean field limit.

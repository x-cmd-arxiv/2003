symmetric cold fronts developing in the remnant of a violent z=0.3 massive
cluster merger. The structure and location of the simulated cold fronts are
very similar to those recently found in X-ray cluster observations, supporting
the merger hypothesis for the origin of at least some of the cold fronts. The
cold fronts are preceded by an almost spherical bow shock which originates at
the core and disappears after 1.6 Gyr. The cold fronts last longer and survive
until z=0. We trace back the gas mass constituting the fronts and find it
initially associated with the two dense cores of the merging clusters.
Conversely, we follow how the energy of the gas of the initial merging cores
evolves until z=0 from the merging and show that a fraction of this gas can
escape from the local potential well of the sub-clumps. This release occurs as
the sub-clumps reach their apocentre in an eccentric orbit and is due to
decoupling between the dark matter and part of the gas in the sub-clump because
of, first, heating of the gas at first close core passage and of, second, the
effect of the global cluster pressure which peaks as the centrifugal
acceleration of the sub-clump is maximal. The fraction of the gas of the
sub-clump liberated in the outbound direction then cools as it expands
adiabatically and constitutes the cold fronts.

determined spectral types and metallicities measured from the same spectra. We
not only find an asymmetric distribution in the V_LSR velocities for the stars
in the two regions, but the angular rate of rotation, w, for the stars in
quadrant I reveals a slower effective rotation rate compared to the
corresponding quadrant IV stars. We use our [Fe/H] measurements to separate the
stars into the three primary population groups, halo, thick disk, and disk, and
conclude that it is primarily the thick disk stars that show the slower
rotation in quadrant I. A solution for the radial, tangential and vertical
components of the V_LSR velocities, reveals a significant lag of ~ 80 to 90
km/s in the direction of Galactic rotation for the thick disk stars in quadrant
I, while in quadrant IV, the same population has only a ~ 20 km/s lag. The
results reported here support a rotational lag among the thick disk stars due
to a gravitational interaction with the bar as the most likely explanation for
the asymmetry in both the star counts and the kinematics. The affected thick

10--30 GHz, unexplained by traditional emission mechanisms, correlates with
100um dust emission. We report that in the Helix the emission at 31 GHz and
100um are well correlated, and exhibit similar features on sky images, which
are absent in H\beta. Upper limits on the 250 GHz continuum emission in the
Helix rule out cold grains as candidates for the 31 GHz emission, and provide
spectroscopic evidence for an excess at 31 GHz over bremsstrahlung. We estimate
that the 100um-correlated radio emission, presumably due to dust, accounts for
at least 20% of the 31 GHz emission in the Helix. This result strengthens
previous tentative interpretations of diffuse ISM spectra involving a new dust
emission mechanism at radio frequencies. Very small grains have not been
detected in the Helix, which hampers interpreting the new component in terms of
spinning dust. The observed iron depletion in the Helix favors considering the
identity of this new component to be magnetic dipole emission from hot
ferromagnetic grains. The reduced level of free-free continuum we report also
implies an electronic temperature of Te=4600\pm1200K for the free-free emitting
material, which is significantly lower than the temperature of 9500\pm500K
inferred from collisionally-excited lines (abridged).

for every Omega_m, there exist a unique n_{peak} (Omega_m), which makes z_{q=0}

unlinearly inverse to Omega_m. If the acceleration happans earlier than z_{q=0}

Omega_m ~ 0.3, it is found n ~ (-0.45,0.25). We next test this scenario using
the Sunyaev-Zeldovich/X-ray data of a sample of 18 galaxy clusters with 0.14 <
z < 0.83 compiled by Reese et al. (2002). The constraints from the current
SZ/X-ray data is weak, though a model with lower matter density is prefered. A
certain range of the model parameters is also consistent with the data.

were selected from R, I and H-alpha imaging observations. We also observed in
two medium-band filters, M855 and M915, for the purpose of spectral type
determination. The former filter covers a wavelength range containing spectral
features characteristic of M-dwarfs, while the latter lies in a relatively
featureless wavelength region for these late-type objects. A correlation was
found between spectral type and (M855-M915) colour index for mid- to late
M-type objects and early L-type dwarfs. With this method, we identify most of
our object candidates as being of spectral type M5 or later. Our results show
that there is no strong drop in the number of objects for the latest spectral
types, hence brown dwarfs may be as abundant as low-mass stars in this region.
Also, both kind of objects have a similar spatial distribution. We derive an
index $\alpha = 0.6 \pm 0.1$ of the mass function in this region of dispersed
star formation, in good agreement with the values obtained in other star
forming regions and young clusters. Some of the brown dwarfs have strong
H-alpha emission, suggesting mass accretion. For objects with published

mid-infrared excess, indicative of the existence of a circumstellar disk.

Distribution (SED) of these galaxies using the stellar evolutionary synthesis

explore the nature of this excess in terms of dust and Polycyclic Aromatic
Hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs). We find that out of 18 galaxies, 10 show excess
at 6.7 microns (due to the presence of PAH features) and 14 show excess at 15
microns (due to the presence of warm dust). In two galaxies, where a more
complete wavelength coverage exists, an excess around 9.7 microns is seen
(presumably due to silicate dust emission), while two other galaxies are
totally devoid of dust. We also examine the morphology of the galaxies in these
wavelengths by plotting the azimuthally averaged radial profiles as well as the
MIR color profiles. We find that for the majority of the galaxies the 4.5
micron emission is well described by a de Vaucouleurs profile. The 6.7 and 15
micron emission is smoothly distributed throughout the galaxy while only a few
galaxies show MIR emission which is more concentrated close to the center. Two
dwarf galaxies in our sample show patchy distributions of the MIR emission
while two other galaxies show edge-on disks. With color-color diagrams we
delineate the regions occupied by late-type and early-type galaxies. Finally we

more stringent than the current experimental results. This bound extends for

hole with a ~ 0.8-0.9 (where r_g = GM/c^2 and a=cJ/GM^2, and assuming that
reflection in the plunging region is relatively small). This confirms
indications for black hole spin based on a Chandra spectrum obtained later in
the outburst. The emission line and reflection spectrum also rule-out a
standard power-law disk emissivity in GX 339-4; a broken power-law form with
enhanced emissivity inside ~6 r_{g} gives improved fits at more than the 8
sigma level of confidence. The extreme red wing of the line and steep
emissivity require a centrally--concentrated source of hard X-rays which can
strongly illuminate the inner disk. Hard X-ray emission from the base of a jet
- enhanced by gravitational light bending effects - could create the
concentrated hard X-ray emission; this process may be related to magnetic
connections between the black hole and the inner disk. We discuss these results
within the context of recent results from analyses of XTE J1650-500 and
MCG-6-30-15, and models for the inner accretion flow environment around black
holes.

eigenvectors and eigenvalues and find that the energy correlation diagram
indicates a transition from a delocalized to a fragmented regime. Phase space
information is extracted from the stationary quantum states using the Husimi
distribution function. It is shown that the quantum states are localized on the
known classical phase space orbits of a nonrigid physical pendulum, and thus
the novel phase space characteristics of a nonrigid physical pendulum such as
the $\pi$ motions are seen to be a property of the exact quantum states. Low
lying states are harmonic oscillator like libration states while the higher
lying states are Schr\""odinger cat-like superpositions of two pendulum rotor
states. To study the dynamics in phase space, a comparison is made between a
displaced quantum wavepacket and the trajectories of a swarm of points in
classical phase space. For a driven double well, it is shown that the classical
chaotic dynamics is manifest in the dynamics of the quantum states pictured
using the Husimi distribution. Phase space analogy also suggests that a $\pi$
phase displaced wavepacket put on the unstable fixed point on a separatrix will
bifurcate to create a superposition of two pendulum rotor states - a
Schr\""odinger cat state (number entangled state) for BEC. It is shown that the
choice of initial barrier height and ramping, following a $\pi$ phase
imprinting on the condensate, can be used to generate controlled entangled
number states with tunable extremity and sharpness.

However, Forum still has to deal with syntactic details that would normally be

on Gentzen systems for linear logic by restricting the language and the form of
inference rules. We further improve on Forum by restricting the class of
formulae allowed, in a system we call G-Forum, which is still equivalent to
full first order linear logic. The only formulae allowed in G-Forum have the
same shape as Forum sequents: the restriction does not diminish expressiveness
and makes G-Forum amenable to proof theoretic analysis. G-Forum consists of two
(big) inference rules, for which we show a cut elimination procedure. This does
not need to appeal to finer detail in formulae and sequents than is provided by
G-Forum, thus successfully testing the internal symmetries of our system.

fermionic matter are different states of the same ""primordial"" fermion fields.
In regime of the fermion densities typical for normal particle physics, the
primordial fermions split into three families identified with regular fermions.
When fermion energy density becomes comparable with dark energy density, the
theory allows new type of states. The possibility of such Cosmo-Low Energy
Physics (CLEP) states is demonstrated by means of solutions of the field theory
equations describing FRW universe filled by homogeneous scalar field and
uniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos. Neutrinos in CLEP state are
drawn into cosmological expansion by means of dynamically changing their own
parameters. One of the features of the fermions in CLEP state is that in the
late time universe their masses increase as a^{3/2}. The energy density of the
cold dark matter consisting of neutrinos in CLEP state scales as a sort of dark
energy; this cold dark matter possesses negative pressure and for the late time
universe its equation of state approaches that of the cosmological constant.
The total energy density of such universe is less than it would be in the
universe free of fermionic matter at all. The (quintessence) scalar field is
coupled to dark matter but its coupling to regular fermionic matter appears to
be extremely strongly suppressed. The key role in obtaining these results
belongs to a fundamental constraint (which is consequence of the action
principle) that plays the role of a new law of nature.

theory of such manifolds. The relation to the affine special Kahler manifolds

elaborate on the upper limit in the senses of viewing the cosmological horizon
as the boundary of a cavity and of the holographic D-bound in a de Sitter
space. Assuming a simple evolution model of inflation, we obtain an expression
of the upper limit in terms of the cosmological constant, the energy density of
inflaton when the inflation starts, the energy density as the inflation ends,
and reheating temperature. We discuss how the upper limit is modified in the
different evolution models of the universe. The holographic D-bound gives more
high upper limit than the entropy threshold in the cavity. For the most
extremal case where the initial energy density of inflation is as high as the
Planck energy, and the reheating temperature is as low as the energy scale of
nucleosynthesis, the D-bound gives the upper limit as 146 and the entropy
threshold as 122. For reasonable assumption in the simplest cosmology, the

optimal spectral gap. The construction is based on a series of 2-lift
operations.
  Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices. A 2-lift of $G$ is a graph $H$ on $2n$
vertices, with a covering map $\pi:H \to G$. It is not hard to see that all
eigenvalues of $G$ are also eigenvalues of $H$. In addition, $H$ has $n$
``new'' eigenvalues. We conjecture that every $d$-regular graph has a 2-lift
such that all new eigenvalues are in the range $[-2\sqrt{d-1},2\sqrt{d-1}]$ (If
true, this is tight, e.g. by the Alon-Boppana bound). Here we show that every
graph of maximal degree $d$ has a 2-lift such that all ``new'' eigenvalues are
in the range $[-c \sqrt{d \log^3d}, c \sqrt{d \log^3d}]$ for some constant $c$.
This leads to a polynomial time algorithm for constructing arbitrarily large
$d$-regular graphs, with second eigenvalue $O(\sqrt{d \log^3 d})$.
  The proof uses the following lemma: Let $A$ be a real symmetric matrix such
that the $l_1$ norm of each row in $A$ is at most $d$. Let $\alpha = \max_{x,y
\in \{0,1\}^n, supp(x)\cap supp(y)=\emptyset} \frac {|xAy|} {||x||||y||}$. Then
the spectral radius of $A$ is at most $c \alpha \log(d/\alpha)$, for some
universal constant $c$.
  An interesting consequence of this lemma is a converse to the Expander Mixing
Lemma.

the solution of the inhomogeneous Euclidean Bethe-Salpeter equation. Our goal
is to determine conditions on the input to the Euclidean Bethe-Salpeter
equation so the solution can be used to construct a model Hilbert space and a
dynamical unitary representation of the Poincar\'e group. We prove three
theorems that relate the stability of this construction to properties of the
kernel and driving term of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The most interesting
result is that the positivity of the Hilbert space norm in the non-interacting
theory is not stable with respect to Euclidean covariant perturbations defined
by Bethe-Salpeter kernels. The long-term goal of this work is to understand
which model Euclidean Green functions preserve the underlying relativistic
quantum theory of the original field theory. Understanding the constraints
imposed on the Green functions by the existence of an underlying relativistic
quantum theory is an important consideration for formulating field-theory
motivated relativistic quantum models.

emerges. However, at least for low frequencies and weak coupling, there is only
a very small, practically non-detectable, deviation from a purely exponential
decay, in agreement with all previous results in the literature.

proposed. The communication is based on GHZ state and controlled quantum
teleportation. After insuring the security of the quantum channel (a set of
qubits in the GHZ state), Alice encodes the secret message directly on a
sequence of particle states and transmits them to Bob supervised by Charlie
using controlled quantum teleportation. Bob can read out the encoded messages
directly by the measurement on his qubits. In this scheme, the controlled
quantum teleportation transmits Alice's message without revealing any
information to a potential eavesdropper. Because there is not a transmission of
the qubit carrying the secret messages between Alice and Bob in the public
channel, it is completely secure for controlled and direct secret communication
if perfect quantum channel is used. The feature of this scheme is that the
communication between two sides depends on the agreement of the third side.

expressions as well as computer simulations of the selected state properties
and preparation efficiency are developed and show that a sub-Poissonian state
can be produced by this technique. Projection onto a given trigger value is
studied and then extended to a finite band. The continuous variable regime
offers the unique possibility to improve dramatically the preparation
efficiency by choosing multiple selection bands and thus to generate a great
number of sub-Poissonian states in parallel.

decoherence. We derive the condition for onset of decoherence, and identify the
noise properties that drive decoherence. We show how this decoherence mechansim
causes: (1) a dephasing of the observable consequences of the adiabatic
geometric phase; and (2) the loss of computational efficiency of the Shor
algorithm when run on a sufficiently noisy geometric quantum computer.

in energy and force show the importance of the geometry, and make evident the

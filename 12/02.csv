X-ray binaries which have been suggested to belong to the class of
ultra-compact X-ray binaries based on their X-ray spectra. Our spectra show no
evidence for hydrogen or helium emission lines, as are seen in classical X-ray
binaries. The spectrum of 4U~0614+09 does show emission lines which we identify
with carbon and oxygen lines of CII, CIII, OII and OIII. While the spectra of
4U 1543-624 and 2S 0918-549 have a lower signal-to-noise ratio, and thus are
more difficult to interpret, some of the characteristic features of 4U 0614+09
are present in these spectra too, although sometimes they are clearly weaker.
We conclude that the optical spectra give further evidence for the
ultra-compact nature of these X-ray binaries and for their donor stars being
carbon-oxygen white dwarfs.

The joint probability distribution used in this context is a weighted
combination of Gaussian and non-Gaussian random fields, such as: P(delta) =
(1-alpha)f_{1}(delta) + alpha*f_{2}(delta), where f_{1}(delta) is a Gaussian

a scale dependent mixture parameter. Results from simulations of CMBR
temperature and polarisation power spectra show a distinct signature for very
small deviations (~ 0.1%) from a pure Gaussian field. We discuss the main

how to apply them to small scale CMBR observations. A reduced chi^2 test shows
that the contribution of an isocurvature fluctuation field is not ruled out in
actual CMB observations, even in WMAP first-year sky map.

for the presence of previously undetected X-ray pulsars. One such pulsar, with
a period of 202 s, is detected. Its position is consistent with an early B star
in the SMC and we identify it as a high mass X-ray binary (HMXB). In the course
of this study we determined the pulse period of the possible AXP CXOU
J010043.1-721134 to be 8.0 s, correcting an earlier report (Lamb et al 2002b)
of a 5.4 s period for this object. Pulse profiles and spectra for each of these
objects are presented as well as for a recently discovered (Haberl & Pietsch
2004) 263 s X-ray pulsar. Properties of an ensemble of 24 optically identified
HMXB pulsars from the SMC are investigated. The locations of the pulsars and an
additional 22 X-ray pulsars not yet identified as having high mass companions
are located predominately in the young (ages $\le 3 \times 10^{7}$ years) star
forming regions of the SMC as expected on the basis of binary evolution models.
We find no significant difference between the distribution of spin periods for
the HMXB pulsars of the SMC compared with that of the Milky Way. For those HMXB
pulsars which have Be companions we note an inverse correlation between spin
period and maximum X-ray flux density. (This anti-correlation has been
previously noted for all X-ray binary pulsars by Stella, White & Rosner 1986).
The anti-correlation for the Be binaries may be a reflection of the fact that
the spin periods and orbital periods of Be HMXBs are correlated. We note a
similar correlation between X-ray luminosity and spin period for the Be HMXB
pulsars of the Milky Way and speculate that exploitation of the correlation
could serve as a distance indicator.

galaxy luminosity. For high luminosities (L ~5 L_*), xi_{gm} deviates
significantly from a power law. These trends with luminosity also appear in the

We confirm both pre-main sequence status and membership, through the detection
of lithium, presence of narrow potassium indicative of low gravity, and
measurement of radial velocity. The Halpha emission profile is very broad, with
a 10% full width of 316 km/s, implying the presence of ongoing accretion. Our
spectra also exhibit many forbidden emission lines indicative of mass outflow.
Using new 2MASS near-infrared photometry, no significant NIR excess is found.
Our optical veiling measurements yield a mass accretion rate of 10^-10 /
10^{-9} M(sun)/yr. Through comparison with the latest synthetic spectra, we
infer Teff~2700+-100K. Theoretical tracks imply an age of ~20 Myr (as derived
from luminosity) or ~8 Myr (Teff vs. gravity) for LS-RCrA~1. Therefore,
LS-RCrA~1 indeed appears sub-luminous relative to expectations for an R~CrA
member. By comparing its position on the H-R diagram with that of other
similarly accreting low-mass objects, we show that accretion-induced effects
are unlikely to account for its faintness. We suggest instead that LS-RCrA~1
posesses a nearly edge-on disk and its photosphere is seen predominantly in
scattered light, making it appear much fainter (and older) than it really is.
Finally, the surface gravity and Teff estimates, combined with the latest
evolutionary tracks, indicate a mass of ~0.07 or 0.035+-0.010 M(sun) (depending
on the Teff scale).

incompressible, uniform density stars in general relativity. Differentially
rotating stars can support significantly more mass in equilibrium than
nonrotating or uniformly rotating stars. The remnant of a binary neutron star
merger or supernova core collapse may produce such a ""hypermassive"" neutron
star. Although a hypermassive neutron star may be stable on a dynamical
timescale, magnetic braking and viscous damping of differential rotation will
ultimately alter the equilibrium structure, possibly leading to delayed
catastrophic collapse. Here we consider the slow-rotation, weak-magnetic field
limit in which E_rot << E_mag << W, where E_rot is the rotational kinetic
energy, E_mag is the magnetic energy, and W is the gravitational binding energy
of the star. We assume the system to be axisymmetric and solve the MHD
equations in both Newtonian gravitation and general relativity. Toroidal
magnetic fields are generated whenever the angular velocity varies along the
initial poloidal field lines. We find that the toroidal fields and angular
velocities oscillate independently along each poloidal field line, which
enables us to transform the original 2+1 equations into 1+1 form and solve them
along each field line independently. The incoherent oscillations on different
field lines stir up turbulent-like motion in tens of Alfven timescales (""phase
mixing""). In the presence of viscosity, the stars eventually are driven to
uniform rotation, with the energy contained in the initial differential
rotation going into heat. Our evolution calculations serve as qualitative
guides and benchmarks for future, more realistic MHD simulations in full 3+1
general relativity.

redshift at any cluster-centric radius. The trend is consistent with the
Butcher-Oemler effect and the morphological Butcher-Oemlereffect. In addition,
we find that colour (spectral) evolution is almost completed by $z\sim0.2$,
whereas morphological evolution continues to the present day. The colour-radius
relation is smooth inall the redshift bins, while the morphology--radius

evolution. It is suggested that red-late type galaxies in the middle of the
transformation are observed as passive spiral galaxies.

  In the sparsest regions (below 1 Mpc$^{-2}$ or outside of 1 virial radius),
both relations become less noticeable, suggesting the responsible physical
mechanisms for galaxy morphological change require denser environment.
  In the intermediate density regions (density between 1 and 6 Mpc$^{-2}$ or

denser regions, whereas late-disc fractions decrease.

ionospheric and tropospheric phase errors, which usually limit VLBI astrometric
accuracy. The pulsars B0329+54, B0355+54 and B1929+10 were observed for 7
epochs spread evenly over 2 years. For B0329+54, large systematic errors lead
to only an upper limit on the parallax (pi < 1.5 mas). A new proper motion and
parallax were measured for B0355+54 (pi = 0.91 +- 0.16 mas), implying a
distance of 1.04+0.21-0.16 kpc and a transverse velocity of 61+12-9 km/s. The

based on our new distance determinations for B1929+10 and B0355+54, we derive
or constrain the luminosities of each pulsar at high energies. We show that,
for thermal emission models, the emitting area for X-rays from PSR B1929+10 is
roughly consistent with the canonical size for a heated polar cap, and that the
conversion of spin-down power to gamma-ray luminosity in B0355+54 must be low.
The new proper motion for B1929+10 also implies that its progenitor is unlikely
to have been the binary companion of the runaway O-star zeta-Ophiuchi.

low-Reynolds-number turbulence. We concentrate on three topics: magnetic-energy
spectra and saturation levels, the structure of the field lines, and the
field-strength distribution. The main results are (1) the folded structure
(direction reversals at the resistive scale, field lines curved at the scale of
the flow) persists from the kinematic to the nonlinear regime; (2) the field
distribution is self-similar and appears to be lognormal during the kinematic
regime and exponential in the saturated state; and (3) the bulk of the magnetic
energy is at the resistive scale in the kinematic regime and remains there
after saturation, although the spectrum becomes much shallower. We propose an
analytical model of saturation based on the idea of partial
two-dimensionalization of the velocity gradients with respect to the local
direction of the magnetic folds. The model-predicted spectra are in excellent
agreement with numerical results. Comparisons with large-Re, moderate-Pm runs
are carried out to confirm the relevance of these results. New features at
large Re are elongation of the folds in the nonlinear regime from the viscous
scale to the box scale and the presence of an intermediate nonlinear stage of
slower-than-exponential magnetic-energy growth accompanied by an increase of
the resistive scale and partial suppression of the kinetic-energy spectrum in
the inertial range. Numerical results for the saturated state do not support
scale-by-scale equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energies, with a
definite excess of magnetic energy at small scales. A physical picture of the
saturated state is proposed.

considerations, indicate that such jets may be launched with a spine/sheath
flow structure, having a much higher Lorentz factor ($\sim 50$) near the axis
and a lower speed ($\Gamma \sim 10$ or so) away from the axis. It has become
clear that one can no longer consider models of accretion flows without also
considering the production of a jet by that flow. Furthermore, the rotation
rate of the black hole also must be taken into account. It provides a third
parameter that should break the mass/accretion rate degeneracy and perhaps
explain why some sources are radio loud and some radio quiet. Slow jet
acceleration and collimation is expected theoretically, and can explain some of
the observed features of AGN jet sources. Finally, relativistic jets launched
by MHD/ED processes are Poynting flux dominated by nature, and are potentially
unstable if there is significant entrainment of thermal material.

The end product of a given ""wide-angle"" astrometry run is an estimated grid
star catalog over the entire sky with an accuracy of about 4 micro-arcseconds.
  SIMsim is divided into five separate modules that communicate via data pipes.
The first generates the 'truth' data on the spacecraft structure and laser
metrology. The second module generates uncorrupted fringes for the three SIM
interferometers, based on the current spacecraft orientation, target stars'
positions, etc. The third module reads out the CCD white light fringe data at
specified times, corrupting that and the metrology data with appropriate
errors. The data stream out of this module represents the basic data stream on
the simulated spacecraft. The fourth module performs fringe-fitting tasks on
this data, recovering the total path delay, and the fifth and final module
inverts the entire metrology/delay dataset to ultimately determine the
instantaneous path delay on a fiducial baseline fixed in space. (Pathlength
feed forward is used every few milliseconds to re-position the interferometer
to keep the fringes in the delay window.) The average of all such delays over
an integration time (typically 30 s) is reported as one of several hundred
thousand measured stellar delays over the five-year period, which are then
inverted to produce the simulated catalog.
  Future plans include taking into account more sources of error from the SIM

We evaluate the distribution of N* in the Small Magellanic Cloud using recent

lowest values of N*. We find that the power-law distribution in N* continues
smoothly down to N*=1. This strongly suggests that the formation of field
massive stars is a continuous process with those in associations, and that the
field stars do not originate from a different star formation mode. Our results
are consistent with the model that field massive stars represent the most
massive members in groups of smaller stars, as expected if the clustering law
applies to much lower masses as is expected from the stellar initial mass
function (IMF). These results are consistent with the simultaneous existence of
a universal IMF and a universal clustering law. Jointly, these laws imply that
the fraction of field OB stars typically ranges from about 35% to 7% for most
astrophysical situations, with an inverse logarithmic dependence on the most
populous cluster, and hence, on galaxy size and/or star formation rate. There
are important consequences for global feedback effects in galaxies: field stars

the arguments that 1) an evolutionary scheme that naturally satisfies the
Bianchi identities will propagate the constraints, and 2) methods in which
temporal and spatial derivatives commute will satisfy the Bianchi identities
implicitly. The proposed algorithm exactly propagates the constraints in a
local Riemann normal coordinate system; {\it i.e.}, all terms in the Bianchi
identities (which all vary as $\partial^3 g$) cancel to machine roundoff
accuracy at each time step. In a general coordinate basis, these terms, and
those that vary as $\partial g\partial^2 g$, also can be made to cancel, but
differences of connection terms, proportional to $(\partial g)^3$, will remain,
resulting in a net truncation error. Detailed and complex numerical experiments
with four-dimensional staggered grids will be needed to completely examine the
stability and convergence properties of this method.
  If such techniques are successful for finite difference implementations of
numerical relativity, other implementations, such as finite element (and

compute time-dependent four-current. Unlike previous equations for the current,
this one ensures that charge drift velocities remain less than the speed of

(CD) kink instability. This instability may be responsible for the ""wiggled""

nonlinear behavior of PFD jets in a variety of external ambient magnetized gas
distributions, including those with density, pressure, and temperature
gradients. Our numerical results show that PFD jets can develop kink
distortions in the trans-Alfv\'enic flow case, even when the flow itself is

instability, a non-axisymmetric mode grows on time scales of order the Alfv\'en
crossing time (in the jet frame) and proceeds to disrupt the kinematic and
magnetic structure of the jet. Because of a large scale poloidal magnetic field
in the ambient medium, the growth of surface modes ({\it i.e.}, MHD
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities) is suppressed. The CD kink mode ($m = 1$) grows
faster than the other higher order modes ($m > 1$), driven in large part by the

diffusion Greens function. Since diffusion cannot be simulated backward in
time, the splitting must maintain the positivity of all intermediate time
steps. However, since the trace is invariant under similarity transformations
of the propagator, one can use this freedom to ""correct"" the split propagator
to higher order. This use of similarity transforms classically give rises to
symplectic corrector algorithms. The split propagator is the symplectic kernel
and the similarity transformation is the corrector. This work proves a
generalization of the Sheng-Suzuki theorem: no positive time step propagators
with only kinetic and potential operators can be corrected beyond second order.
Second order forward propagators can have fourth order traces only with the
inclusion of an additional commutator. We give detailed derivations of four
forward correctable second order propagators and their minimal correctors.

  sequences",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.MN",,"  Random graphs with prescribed degree sequences have been widely used as a
model of complex networks. Comparing an observed network to an ensemble of such
graphs allows one to detect deviations from randomness in network properties.
Here we briefly review two existing methods for the generation of random graphs
with arbitrary degree sequences, which we call the ``switching'' and
``matching'' methods, and present a new method based on the ``go with the
winners'' Monte Carlo method. The matching method may suffer from nonuniform
sampling, while the switching method has no general theoretical bound on its
mixing time. The ``go with the winners'' method has neither of these drawbacks,
but is slow. It can however be used to evaluate the reliability of the other
two methods and, by doing this, we demonstrate that the deviations of the
switching and matching algorithms under realistic conditions are small compared
to the ``go with the winners'' algorithm. Because of its combination of speed
and accuracy we recommend the use of the switching method for most
calculations.

Special emphasis is put on dynamic mean field theory. In the first part I
present some of the systems of interest, in particular spin-glasses,
supercooled liquids and glasses, drift, creep and pinning of a particle in a
random potential, neural networks, graph partitioning as an example of
combinatorial optimisation, the K-sat problem and the minority game as a model
for the behaviour of agents on markets. The second part deals with the dynamics
of the spherical p-spin-glass with long ranged interactions. This model is a
prototype for glassy dynamics. The equations of motion for correlation- and
response-functions are derived and solutions above and below the freezing
temperature are investigated. At the end I discuss the so called crossover
region and aging in glasses. The commonly used mode coupling theory results in
equations of motion identical to those of the $p$-spin model above the
dynamical transition temperature. The p-spin model is extended introducing the
random interactions as slow dynamical variables as well. This takes changes in
the configuration of cages into account. This is an activated process.
Depending on the waiting time, equilibrium or aging is found.

(correlated) deposition of particles on a surface and formation of a connecting

transition) when a percolating cluster appears. The parameter k is included in
the probability p(k) of particles to stick together and form a cluster on the
surface. The case k=1 corresponds to the ordinary 2D percolation on a square
lattice. Thus the percolation threshold is controlled by the k-value: the
larger k the higher threshold for percolation. The growth model seen from the
percolation point of view allows us to describe several interesting
applications in addition to irreversible aggregation in the presence of a
repulsive force, k>1. For example, the occupied lattice sites might represent
regions of specific magnetization in an otherwise disordered medium. Then the

hidden order characterizing spin-1 Heisenberg chains. We construct a string
correlator for the Luttinger liquid which is similar to the string correlator
constructed by den Nijs and Rommelse for the spin chain. From a geometric
prespective on the so-called `squeezed space' construction, we demonstrate that
the physics at long wavelength can be reformulated in terms of a $Z_2$ gauge
theory. Peculiarly, the normal spin chain lives at infinite gauge coupling
where it is characterized by deconfinement. We identify the microscopic
conditions required for confinement thereby identifying a novel phase of the
spin-chain. We demonstrate that the Luttinger liquid can be approached in the
same general framework. The difference from the spin chain is that the gauge
sector is critical in the sense that the Luttinger liquid is at the phase
boundary where the $Z_2$ local symmetry emerges. We evaluate the string
correlator analytically and show that the squeezed space structure is present
both for the strongly coupled Hubbard model and the non-interacting fermion
gas. These structures are hard-wired in the mathematical structure of
bosonization and this becomes obvious by considering string correlators.
Numerical results are presented for the string correlator using a non-abelian
version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm, confirming in
detail the expectations following from the theory. We conclude with some
observations regarding the generalization of bosonization to higher dimensions.

this is enhanced with increasing magnetic field. This peak is regarded as being
attributable to the enhancement of the thermal conductivity due to magnons
and/or phonons because of the drastic extension of the mean free path of
magnons and/or phonons in the Bose-Einstein condensed state.

  York (2003)",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con",,"  The microwave response of ceramic MgB2 has been investigated as a function of
temperature and external magnetic field by two different techniques: microwave
surface impedance and second-harmonic emission measurements. The measurements
of the surface resistance have shown that microwave losses in MgB2 are strongly
affected by the magnetic field in the whole range of temperatures below Tc,
even for relatively low field values. The results have been accounted for in
the framework of the Coffey and Clem model hypothesizing that in different
temperature ranges the microwave current induces fluxons to move in different
regimes. In particular, the results at temperatures close to Tc have been
quantitatively justified by assuming that fluxons move in the flux-flow regime
and taking into account the anisotropy of the upper critical field. At low
temperatures, the field dependence of the surface resistance follows the law
expected in the pinning limit; however, an unusually enhanced field variation
has been detected, which could be due to the peculiar fluxon structure of MgB2,
related to the presence of the two gaps. The measurements of the
second-harmonic signals have highlighted several mechanisms responsible for the
nonlinear response. At low magnetic fields and low temperatures, the nonlinear
response is due to processes involving weak links. At temperatures close to Tc,
a further contribution to the harmonic emission is present; it arises from the
modulation of the order parameter by the microwave field and gives rise to a
peak in the temperature dependence of the harmonic-signal intensity.

Supersymmetry breaking by such systems can be viewed as FI D-term breaking,
which implies, under certain conditions, the presence of gauged R-symmetry on
such backgrounds. The D-term nature of the brane-anti-brane energy can also
provide information on the superpotential for the tachyon, which Higgses the
R-symmetry. In this picture, the inter-brane force can be viewed as a result of
the world-volume gauge coupling renormalization by the open string loops.

accelerations and temperatures. The Hawking temperature, elementary particle
and string temperatures are shown to be the same concept in different energy
regimes and turn out the precise classical-quantum duals of each other;
similarly, this result holds for the BH decay rate, heavy particle and string
decay rates; BH evaporation ends as quantum string decay into pure (non mixed)
radiation. Microscopic density of states and entropies in the two

string phase transition towards the dS string temperature (which is shown to be
the precise quantum dual of the semiclassical (Hawking-Gibbons) dS temperature)

behaviour) sector in AdS. From the string mass spectrum and string density of
states in curved backgrounds, quantum properties of the backgrounds themselves
are extracted and the quantum mass spectrum of BH, dS and AdS radii obtained.

longitudinal magnetic field generated by a static magnetic brane. We also
generalize this solution to the case of spinning magnetic branes with one or
more rotation parameters. We find that these solutions have no curvature
singularity and no horizons, but have a conic geometry. In these spacetimes,
when all the rotation parameters are zero, the electric field vanishes, and
therefore the brane has no net electric charge. For the spinning brane, when
one or more rotation parameters are non zero, the brane has a net electric
charge which is proportional to the magnitude of the rotation parameter. The
second class of solutions yields a spacetime with an angular magnetic field.
These solutions have no curvature singularity, no horizon, and no conical
singularity. Again we find that the net electric charge of the branes in these

a macroscopic scale, while only a microscopic evolution law is known. For such
time-dependent multi-scale problems, an ``equation-free framework'' has been
proposed, of which the gap-tooth scheme is an essential component. The
gap-tooth scheme is designed to approximate a time-stepper for an unavailable
macroscopic equation in a macroscopic domain; it uses appropriately initialized
simulations of the available microscopic model in a number of small boxes,
which cover only a fraction of the domain. We analyze the convergence of this
scheme for a parabolic homogenization problem with non-linear reaction. In this
case, the microscopic model is a partial differential equation with rapidly
oscillating coefficients, while the unknown macroscopic model is approximated
by the homogenized equation. We show that our method approximates a finite
difference scheme of arbitrary (even) order for the homogenized equation when
we appropriately constrain the microscopic problem in the boxes. We illustrate
this theoretical result with numerical tests on several model problems. We also
demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a convergent scheme without
constraining the microscopic code, by introducing buffer regions around the
computational boxes.

exponential of two or more operators acting on initial data. Accurate solutions
can be systematically derived by decomposing the exponential in a product form.
For time-reversible equations, such as the Hamilton or the Schr\""odinger
equation, it is immaterial whether or not the decomposition coefficients are
positive. In fact, most symplectic algorithms for solving classical dynamics
contain some negative coefficients. For time-irreversible systems, such as the
Fokker-Planck equation or the quantum statistical propagator, only
positive-coefficient decompositions, which respect the time-irreversibility of
the diffusion kernel, can yield practical algorithms. These positive time steps
only, forward decompositions, are a highly effective class of factorization
algorithms. This work introduce a framework for understanding the structure of
these algorithms. By a suitable representation of the factorization
coefficients, we show that specific error terms and order conditions can be
solved {\it analytically}. Using this framework, we can go beyond the
Sheng-Suzuki theorem and derive a lower bound for the error coefficient
$e_{VTV}$. By generalizing the framework perturbatively, we can further prove
that it is not possible to have a sixth order forward algorithm by including
only the commutator $[VTV]\equiv[V,[T,V]]$. The pattern of these higher order
forward algorithms is that in going from the (2n)$^{\rm th}$ to the
(2n+2)$^{\rm th}$ order, one must include a new commutator $[VT^{2n-1}V]$ in

is explained and total and partially differential cross sections for electron

classical description fails to describe the dominant TS1 process, which leads
to big deviations, whereas for low energies the total cross section is

the rules for analytic continuation around these surfaces, and the analytic

important properties of the S matrix are thus derived without using stringent

implement quantum key distribution, which is usually based on single photon
counting. The former approach is potentially advantageous because it should
enable higher key distribution rates. Here we propose and experimentally
demonstrate a quantum key distribution protocol based on the transmission of
gaussian-modulated coherent states (consisting of laser pulses containing a few
hundred photons) and shot-noise-limited homodyne detection; squeezed or
entangled beams are not required. Complete secret key extraction is achieved
using a reverse reconciliation technique followed by privacy amplification. The
reverse reconciliation technique is in principle secure for any value of the
line transmission, against gaussian individual attacks based on entanglement
and quantum memories. Our table-top experiment yields a net key transmission
rate of about 1.7 megabits per second for a loss-free line, and 75 kilobits per
second for a line with losses of 3.1 dB. We anticipate that the scheme should
remain effective for lines with higher losses, particularly because the present
limitations are essentially technical, so that significant margin for
improvement is available on both the hardware and software.

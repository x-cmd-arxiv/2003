Galactic emission process, perhaps spinning dust grains, making dramatically
different predictions for its behavior at lower frequencies. By
cross-correlating this ""synchrotron"" template with 10 and 15 GHz CMB

feed-forward neural networks. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural
Network is used to predict photometric redshifts in the HDF-S from an ultra
deep multicolor catalog. Various possible approaches for the training of the
neural network are explored, including the deepest and most complete
spectroscopic redshift catalog currently available (the Hubble Deep Field North
dataset) and models of the spectral energy distribution of galaxies available
in the literature. The MLP can be trained on observed data, theoretical data
and mixed samples. The prediction of the method is tested on the spectroscopic
sample in the HDF-S (44 galaxies). Over the entire redshift range, $0.1<z<3.5$,
the agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts in the HDF-S
is good: the training on mixed data produces sigma_z(test) ~ 0.11, showing that
model libraries together with observed data provide a sufficiently complete
description of the galaxy population. The neural system capability is also
tested in a low redshift regime, 0<z<0.4, using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Data Release One (DR1) spectroscopic sample. The resulting accuracy on 88108
galaxies is sigma_z(test) ~ 0.022. Inputs other than galaxy colors - such as
morphology, angular size and surface brightness - may be easily incorporated in
the neural network technique. An important feature, in view of the application
of the technique to large databases, is the computational speed: in the
evaluation phase, redshifts of 10^5 galaxies are estimated in few seconds.

that photoionization is the dominant ionization mechanism close to the nucleus.

reasonably well by simple photoionization models using a central power-law

the previous results showing [S/Fe] to rise steadily with decreasing [Fe/H],
our results show that [S/Fe] is approximately constant for metal-poor stars

Galaxy is crucial in order to predict whether current gravity wave detectors
will be successful in detecting such bursts. Present estimates of this rate are
rather low, because we know of only a few double-neutron-star binaries with
merger times less than the age of the Universe. Here we report the discovery of
a 22-ms pulsar, PSR J0737-3039, which is a member of a highly relativistic

will merge in about 85 Myr, a time much shorter than for any other known

magnitude as has been proposed for the giant outbursts of the Luminous Blue
Variable Eta Carinae. Over the past two years since the outburst event we
observe a very prominent inverse P Cygni profile in Balmer H alpha. Strong
Halpha emission has not before been observed in the hypergiant over this long
period of time, signaling an unusual strong collapse of the upper hydrogen
atmosphere, which we also observed in the months before the 2000 outburst.
Since the brightness decrease of March 2003 we observe a transformation of the
H alpha profile into a P Cygni profile, signaling a strong expansion of Rho
Cas's upper atmosphere, which could possibly result in a new outburst event.
High-resolution spectroscopic observations reveal that the lower photosphere
rapidly expanded until May-June 2003. Very recent high-resolution observations
of September 2003 show however that the photospheric absorption lines did not
shift far blueward as observed in July 2000 before the strong brightness
decrease of the outburst. The Fe I 5572 A is redshifted, signaling the collapse

colors. The class of dEN galaxies are redder in their continuum colors as
compared to bright cluster ellipticals and dE type dwarfs, and their position
in multi-color diagrams can only be explained by an older mean age for their
underlying stellar populations. By comparison with the narrow band photometry
of the M87 globular cluster system (Jordan et al. 2002), we find that dENs are
a higher metallicity continuation of the old, metal-poor color sequence of
galactic globulars and the blue population of M87 globulars. Bright ellipticals
and dE dwarfs, on the other hand, follow the color sequence of the metal-rich,
red population of M87 globulars. A comparison to SED models, convolved to a
simple metallicity model, finds that dENs and blue globulars are 3 to 4 Gyrs
older than cluster ellipticals and 5 Gyrs older than dE type galaxies. The
implication is that globulars and dEN galaxies are primordial and have
metallicities set by external constraints such as the enrichment of their
formation clouds. Bright ellipticals and dE galaxies have metallicities and
ages that suggest an extended phase of initial star formation to produce a
younger mean age, even if their formation epoch is similar to that of dENs and
blue globulars, and an internally driven chemical evolutionary history.

no substantial destabilization of the flame when propagating into quiescent

of large-scale SN Ia explosion models. For these models, however, we suggest an
increased lower cutoff for the flame propagation velocity to take the cellular

colloidal lattice which can distort in response to the driven particle. We find
a remarkably rich variety of dynamical locking phenomena as we vary the angle
of the applied drive with respect to the orientation of the colloidal lattice.
When the driven colloid locks to certain lattice symmetry directions, its
motion is not necessarily aligned with the drive. Applying a transverse force
to the driven particle can result in either increased or decreased drag in the
driving direction, depending on the angle of the drive. The dynamical locking
produces anomalies in both the longitudinal and the transverse velocity vs
driving force curves, including steps and regimes of negative differential
resistance. As the interaction of the driven particle with the surrounding
lattice increases, significant distortion or dislocations in the surrounding
media occur, and as a result the directional locking is enhanced. We compare
these results to those obtained for driving particles over fixed substrates,
and show that a far richer variety of behaviors occurs when the underlying
lattice is allowed to distort. We discuss how this system can be used for
particle species segregation when the onset of different locking angles occurs
at different drives for varied particle sizes. We also show that the most
pronounced locking phases should be observable at temperatures up to the
melting transition of the colloidal lattice.

charge inversion is not obtained in thermodynamical equilibrium for physical

does not have a simple scaling form with the bare surface charge. Our results
indicate that more evolved explanation is needed in order to understand

derive simple scaling laws for the polyelectrolyte adsorption and overcharging.

its magnitude is very small in comparison to the surface charge. In contrast
with the attractive surface, here the overcharging is found to decrease
substantially with addition of salt. In the intermediate range of weak

connected in that the above sum rule would be violated, if there is no such a
singularity in $e^u(x)+e^d(x)$. Very recently, we found that the physical
origin of this $\delta$-function singularity can be traced back to the

spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of the QCD vacuum. The main purpose of the
present paper is to give complete theoretical predictions for the chiral-odd

approximation. These theoretical predictions are then compared with the
empirical information extracted from the CLAS data of the semi-inclusive DIS

CLAS data is indicative of a sizable violation of the $\pi N$ sigma-term sum
rule, or equivalently, the existence of a $\delta$-function singularity in

contributions are shown to be vital for consistency with the anomalous axial

affects the sum rule results and reveals a rather diverse pattern of glueball
properties. New predictions for the spin-0 glueball masses and decay constants

A Langevin description allows numerical implementation and provides clues for

analyze the induced geometry of the set of densities satisfying the constraint

this, we determine a criterion for convexity of functionals in the induced

convex on the constrained manifold, though not uniformly convex without the

stratified by the topological type of the curves being parametrized: the
closure of the locus of curves with $k$ nodes has codimension $k$. The one
dimensional components of this stratification are smooth rational curves (whose
numerical equivalence classes are) called F-curves. The F-conjecture asserts
that a divisor on $\M_{g,n}$ is ample if and only if it positively intersects
the $F-$curves.
  In this paper the F-conjecture on $\M_{g,n}$ is reduced to showing that
certain divisors in $\M_{0,N}$ for $N \leq g+n$ are equivalent to the sum of
the canonical divisor plus an effective divisor supported on the boundary. As
an application of the reduction, numerical criteria are given which if
satisfied by a divisor $D$ on $\M_g$, show that $D$ is ample. Additionally, an
algorithm is described to check that a given divisor is ample.
  Using a computer program called Nef Wizard, written by Daniel Krashen

algorithm to verify the conjecture for low genus. This is done on $\M_g$ for $g

  corrected. One reference added",,,,"math.DS math.SG",,"  For many classes of symplectic manifolds, the Hamiltonian flow of a function
with sufficiently large variation must have a fast periodic orbit. This
principle is the base of the notion of Hofer-Zehnder capacity and some other
symplectic invariants and leads to numerous results concerning existence of
periodic orbits of Hamiltonian flows. Along these lines, we show that given a
negatively curved manifold M, a neigbhourhood U of M in the cotangent bundle, a
sufficiently small magnetic field and a non-trivial free homotopy class of
loops, then the magnetic flow of a Hamiltonian with big enough variation has a
one-periodic orbit in that class. As a consequence, we obtain estimates for the
relative Hofer-Zehnder capacity and the Biran-Polterovich-Salamon capacity of a
neighbourhood of M.

(defined by a 2X2 payoff matrix). Examples of possible games to play are: the
Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game, the Chicken game, the Hero game, etc. The agents
have no memory, use strategies not based on direct reciprocity nor 'tags' and
are chosen at random, i.e. geographical vicinity is neglected. They can play
two possible strategies: cooperate (C) or defect (D). The players measure their
success by comparing their utilities with an estimate for the expected benefits
and update their strategy following a simple rule. Two versions of the model
are studied: 1) the deterministic version (the agents are either in definite
states C or D) and 2) the stochastic version (the agents have a probability c
of playing C). Using a general Master Equation we compute the equilibrium
states into which the system self-organizes, characterized by their average
probability of cooperation c_{eq}. Depending on the payoff matrix, we show that
c_{eq} can take five different values. We also consider the mixing of agents

reached by tunning the proportions of agents using each payoff matrix. In
particular, this can be used as a way to simulate the effect a fraction d of

  Gutenberg-Richter law","20 pages, 1 table, 33 figures","Computational Seismology 35, 138-159 (2004)",,,"physics.data-an physics.geo-ph",,"  A new non-parametric statistic is introduced for the characterization of
deviations from power laws. It is tested on the distribution of seismic
energies given by the Gutenberg-Richter law. Based on the two first statistical
log-moments, it evaluates quantitatively the deviations of the distribution of
scalar seismic moments from a power-like (Pareto) law. This statistic is close
to zero for the Pareto law with arbitrary power index, and deviates from zero
for any non-Pareto distribution. A version of this statistic for discrete
distribution of quantified magnitudes is also given. A methodology based on
this statistics consisting in scanning the lower threshold for earthquake
energies provides an explicit visualization of deviations from the Pareto law,
surpassing in sensitivity the standard Hill estimator or other known
techniques. This new statistical technique has been applied to shallow
earthquakes (h < 70 km) both in subduction zones and in mid-ocean ridge zones
(using the Harvard catalog of seismic moments, 1977-2000), and to several
regional catalogs of magnitudes (California, Japan, Italy, Greece). We discover
evidence for log-periodicity and thus for a discrete hierarchy of scales for
low-angle dipping, low-strain subduction zones with a preferred scaling ratio
g=7+-1 for seismic moments, compatible with a preferred scaling ratio of 2 for
linear rupture sizes, and consistent with previous reports. We propose a
possible mechanism in terms of cascades of fault competitions.

over a conventionl toroidal horn when used with a multimegawatt proton source
to pursue studies of CP violation in neutrino oscillations. 1) A solenoid horn
can produce a neutrino spectrum with a sequence of peaks at momenta P = P_0 /
(2 n + 1), which has the same form as the sequence of momenta at which the
neutrino oscillation probability is maximal for a fixed distance from source to
detector. 2) The neutrino flux is a roughly equal mixture of neutrinos and
antineutrinos. 3) Rates of electron neutrinos from muon decay are suppressed
relative to those in a broad-band neutrino beam. 4) A solenoid magnet has its
coils far from the axis where the target is located, and hence the coils are
more readily protected from radiation damage. 5) A solenoid magnet is readily
compatible with a liquid metal target, as will be needed for use with very
intense proton sources. 6) A solenoid magnet is a DC device, and hence not
subject to pulse fatigue as for a conventional toroidal horn.

also be used to derive an upper bound on trade-off relations for a more general
class of optimal cloners which clone states on a specific orbit of the Bloch

yielding contact interactions. In quantum mechanics, these singularities
accommodate an unexpectedly rich structure and thereby provide a variety of
physical phenomena, especially if their properties are controlled properly.
Based on our recent studies, we present a brief review on the physical aspects
of such quantum singularities in one dimension. Among the intriguing phenomena
that the singularities admit, we mention strong vs weak duality, supersymmetry,
quantum anholonomy (Berry phase), and a copying process by anomalous caustics.
We also show that a partition wall as a singularity in a potential well can
give rise to a quantum force which exhibits an interesting temperature behavior
characteristic to the particle statistics.

which can realize secure communication with high speeds and at long distance by
conventional optical devices. Recently, a criticism of the Yuen protocol, so
called Y-00, was made by Nishioka, and Imai group(Mitsubishi and University of
Tokyo), and they claimed Y-00 is essentially a classical stream cipher. This
paper shows that the claim is incorrect. In particular, it is shown that the
relation $l_i=r_i\oplus \tilde{k}_i$, which is their basis for attack, has no
essential role for any security analysis. In addition, we give a brief
introduction of the general logic for the security of Y-00 as direct encryption
and also for key generation.
  Several industries have started to make a test-bed of Y-00 for digital
optical fiber highway, following Kumar's leading work. We hope that this
discussion encourages experimental works which realize a secure communication
against quantum computer and quantum attacks based on physical principle.

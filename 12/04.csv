0.02 +- 0.09 mag and a distance modulus of (m-M)o=12.27 +- 0.02 +- 0.12 mag,
which corresponds to a distance of 2.8 +- 0.2 Kpc. We derive a logarithmic
mass-function slope for the cluster of a=-3.12 +- 0.27, where a Salpeter slope
is a=-1.35. Fits to the radial surface-density profile yield a core radius of
r_c=3.10 +- 0.52 arcmin (2.57 +- 0.47 pc). NGC 1245 is highly relaxed and
contains a strongly mass segregated population. The mass function for the inner
cluster has a very shallow slope, b=-0.56 +- 0.28. In contrast, the outer
periphery of the cluster is enriched with low mass members and devoid of high
mass members out to the tidal radius, r_t=20 arcmin (16.5 pc). Based on the
observed surface-density profile and an extrapolated mass function, we derive a
total cluster mass, M=1300 +- 90 +- 170 M_(solar).

from the gravitationally lensed Lyman break galaxy MS1512-cB58. This is the
first detection of a molecular emission line in any Lyman break system; its
integrated intensity implies a total molecular gas mass of 6.6e9 Msun, while
its width implies a dynamical mass of 1.0e10 csc^2i Msun (for a flat Lambda=0.7
cosmology). These estimates are in excellent concordance with nearly all
parameters of the system measured at other wavelengths, and yield a consistent
picture of past and future star formation with no obvious discrepancies
requiring explanation by differential lensing. In particular, we find that the
age and remaining lifetime of the current episode of star formation are likely
to be similar; the surface densities of star formation and molecular gas mass
are related by a Schmidt law; and the fraction of baryonic mass already
converted into stars is sufficient to account for the observed enrichment of
the interstellar medium to 0.4 Zsun. Barring substantial gas inflow or a major
merger, the stars forming in the current episode will have mass and coevality
at z=0 similar to those of a spiral bulge. Assuming cB58 is a typical Lyman
break galaxy apart from its magnification, its global parameters suggest that
the prescriptions for star formation used in some semi-analytic models of
galaxy evolution require moderate revision, although the general prediction
that gas mass fraction should increase with redshift is validated. [abridged]

rigorous statistical method, we present the calculations reported by Burgay et
al., which produce a in-spiral rate for Galactic double neutron star (DNS)
systems that is higher by a factor of 5-7 compared to estimates made prior to
the new discovery. Our method takes into account known pulsar-survey selection
effects and biases due to small-number statistics. This rate increase has
dramatic implications for gravitational wave detectors. For the initial Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors, the most
probable detection rates for DNS in-spirals are one event per 10-630 yr; at 95%
confidence, we obtain rates up to one per 3 yr. For the advanced LIGO
detectors, the most probable rates are 10-500 events per year. These
predictions, for the first time, bring the expectations for DNS detections by
the initial LIGO detectors to the astrophysically relevant regime. We also use
our models to predict that the large-scale Parkes Multibeam pulsar survey with
acceleration searches could detect an average of four binary pulsars similar to
those known at present.

Plasma waves and their associated instabilities (e.g., the Buneman instability,
two-streaming instability, and the Weibel instability) created in the shocks
are responsible for particle (electron, positron, and ion) acceleration. Using
a 3-D relativistic electromagnetic particle (REMP) code, we have investigated
particle acceleration associated with a relativistic jet front propagating
through an ambient plasma with and without initial magnetic fields. We find
only small differences in the results between no ambient and weak ambient
magnetic fields. Simulations show that the Weibel instability created in the
collisionless shock front accelerates particles perpendicular and parallel to
the jet propagation direction. The simulation results show that this
instability is responsible for generating and amplifying highly nonuniform,
small-scale magnetic fields, which contribute to the electron's transverse
deflection behind the jet head. The ``jitter'' radiation from deflected
electrons has different properties than synchrotron radiation which is
calculated in a uniform magnetic field. This jitter radiation may be important
to understanding the complex time evolution and/or spectral structure in
gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jets, and supernova remnants.

typical detection of 30-140 sources per galaxy. After correcting for
incompleteness, the individual XLFs are statistically consistent with a single
power-law of a (differential) XLF slope b = 1.8 - 2.2 (with a typical error of

some of these galaxies, is not required in any case. Although the combined XLF
is marginally consistent with a single power-law (with b = 2.1 +- 0.1), a
broken power-law gives an improved fit. The best-fit slope is b = 1.8 +- 0.2 in
the low-luminosity range LX = a few x 1037 - 5 x 1038 ergs s-1. At higher
luminosities, the slope is steeper, b = 2.8 +- 0.6. The break luminosity is 5

Eddington luminosity of neutron stars with the largest possible mass (3 Mo), of
He-enriched neutron star binaries, or low-mass stellar mass black holes. If the
change in XLF slope at high luminosities is real, our result would imply a
different population of high luminosity sources, instead of a beaming effect.
We confirm that the total X-ray luminosity of LMXBs is correlated with the
optical and more tightly with the near-IR luminosities, but in both cases the
scatter exceeds that expected from measurement errors. We find that the scatter

column densities of multiple ionization stages of silicon (SiII/III/IV) and

PKS 2155-304, for HVCs at -140 and -270 km/s, respectively, we measure
logN(OVI)=13.80+/-0.03 and log N(OVI)=13.56+/-0.06; from Lyman series
absorption, we find log N(HI)=16.37^(+0.22)_(-0.14) and 15.23^(+0.38)_(-0.22).
The presence of high-velocity OVI spread over a broad (100 km/s) profile,
together with large amounts of low-ionization species, is difficult to
reconcile with the low densities, n=5x10^(-6) cm^(-3), in the
collisional/photoionization models of Nicastro et al. (2002), although the HVCs
show a similar relation in N(SiIV)/N(CIV) versus N(CII)/N(CIV) as high-z
intergalactic clouds. Our results suggest that the high-velocity OVI in these
absorbers do not necessarily trace the WHIM, but instead may trace HVCs with
low total hydrogen column density. We propose that the broad high-velocity OVI
absorption arises from shock ionization, at bowshock interfaces produced from
infalling clumps of gas with velocity shear. The similar ratios of high ions
for HVC Complex C and these highly ionized HVCs suggest a common production
mechanism in the Galactic halo.

complementary under-dense excursion set at the same density threshold. We
determine the geometric, topological and morphological properties of the cosmic
web at a large set of density levels by computing Minkowski functionals for
every supercluster and void using SURFGEN. The properties of the largest
(percolating) supercluster and the complementary void are found to be very
different from properties of individual superclusters and voids. Individual
superclusters totally occupy no more than about 5% of the total volume and
contain no more than 20% of mass if the largest supercluster is excluded.
Likewise, individual voids totally occupy no more than 14% of volume and
contain no more than 4% of mass if the largest void is excluded. Although
superclusters are more massive and voids are more voluminous the difference in
maximum volumes is not greater than by an order of magnitude. The genus value
of individual superclusters can be 5 while the genus of individual voids can
reach 40, implying significant amount of substructure in superclusters and
especially in voids. One of our main results is that large voids, as defined
through the density field (read dark matter distribution) can be distinctly

high significance. Using their optical to mid-infrared colors, we divided the
6.7um sample into three categories: low redshift galaxies with past histories
of rapid star formation, high redshift ancestors of these, and other star
forming galaxies. Rapidly star forming systems at high redshifts dominate the
faintest end. Spectroscopically calibrated photometric redshifts were derived
from fits to a limited set of template SEDs. They show a high redshift tail in
their distribution with faint (<30uJy) galaxies at z>1. The 6.7um galaxies tend
to have brighter K magnitudes and redder I-K colors than the blue dwarf

velocities of these four stars were monitored regularly with the Hobby Eberly
Telescope (HET) for approximately two months, while sparse data were also taken
over ~4 months: we also obtained near-simultaneous photometric observations

rotation rates for Hyades members. The fourth star continues to show rv
variations and minimal photometric variability but with no significant

a significant portion of the rv fluctuations are likely due primarily to
magnetic activity modulated by stellar rotation rather than planetary
companions. Using simple models for the rv perturbations arising from spot and

analyzed with the help of the spectroscopy of the number of scatterings

drain end, even in terms of flux, is not the only relevant characteristic of
ballistic transport. Then the drive current in the 15 nm-long channel
transistor generations should be very close to the value obtained in the
ballistic limit even if all electrons are not ballistic. Additionally, most
back-scattering events which deteriorates the ON current, take place in the
first half of the channel and in particular in the first low field region.
However, the contribution of the second half of the channel can not be
considered as negligible in any studied case i.e. for a channel length below 25
nm. Furthermore, the contribution of the second half of the channel tends to be
more important as the channel length is reduced. So, in ultra short channel
transistors, it becomes very difficult to extract a region of the channel which
itself determine the drive current Ion.

the ``bulk'' spectrum of the metallic phase and found that it has a strong
incoherent part. The width of the coherent part is comparable to that given by

that the momentum dependence of the self-energy is significant. This is

vanish with the temperature. A very intriguing apparent saturation of this

fluctuations has generated both theoretical and experimental controversies. We
start by proving that the dephasing rate must vanish at the $T\to 0$ limit,
unless a large ground state degeneracy exists. This thermodynamic proof
includes most systems of relevance and it is valid for any determination of
$\tau_{\phi}$ from {\em linear} transport measurements. In fact, our
experiments demonstrate unequivocally that indeed when strictly linear
transport is used, the apparent low-temperature saturation of $\tau_{\phi}$ is
eliminated. However, the conditions to be in the linear transport regime are
more strict than hitherto expected. Another novel result of the experiments is
that introducing heavy nonmagnetic impurities (gold) in our samples produces,
even in linear transport, a shoulder in the dephasing rate at very low
temperatures. We then show theoretically that low-lying local defects may
produce a relatively large dephasing rate at low temperatures. However, as
expected, this rate in fact vanishes when $T \to 0$, in agreement with our
experimental observations.

facilitates producing near-optimal system controllers. Applied to such methods
of computational intelligence as neural networks or fuzzy logic, these methods
are capable of combining the non-linear mapping capabilities of the latter with
learning the system behavior directly, that is, without a prior model. At the
same time, genetic algorithms routinely produce solutions that lead to the
failure of the controlled system. Such solutions are generally unacceptable for
applications where safe operation must be guaranteed. We present here a method
of design, which allows failure-free application of genetic algorithms through
utilization of SAFE and LEARNING controllers in tandem, where the SAFE
controller recovers the system from dangerous states while the LEARNING
controller learns its behavior. The method has been validated by applying it to
an inherently unstable system of inverted pendulum.

through a global fit to the experimental F2^gamma data. In this paper we
present, obtained for the very first time in the photon case, an estimate of
the uncertainties of the CJK parton distributions due to the experimental
errors. The analysis is based on the Hessian method which was recently applied
in the proton parton structure analysis. Sets of test parametrizations are
given for the CJK model. They allow for calculation of its best fit parton
distributions along with F2^gamma and for computation of uncertainties of any
physical value depending on the real photon parton densities. We test the
applicability of the approach by comparing uncertainties of example
cross-sections calculated in the Hessian and Lagrange methods. Moreover, we
present a detailed analysis of the chi^2 of the CJK fit and its relation to the
data. We show that large chi^2/DOF of the fit is due to only a few of the
experimental measurements. By excluding them chi^2/DOF approx 1 can be
obtained.

These codes can be understood as left principal ideals in a suitable

for cyclic codes. We will investigate whether all these combinations can indeed

should be used? Should the total field be used, or only the external field? And
if the latter, what is meant by ""external""? Can/should effects of magnetization
currents and/or fictitious magnetic poles be included? What is the force on
only a portion of a circuit? We review several well-known approaches to
magnetic force calculations on elements of rigid circuits, and find it very
helpful to use an explicit example to compare and contrast the various methods.

apparently non-coding sequence are conserved between the human and mouse
genomes. It seems reasonable to assume that these conserved regions are more
likely to contain functional elements than less-conserved portions of the
genome. Here we used a motif-oriented machine learning method to extract the
strongest signal from a set of non-coding conserved sequences.
  Results: We successfully fitted models to reflect the non-coding sequences,
and showed that the results were quite consistent for repeated training runs.
Using the learned model to scan genomic sequence, we found that it often made
predictions close to the start of annotated genes. We compared this method with
other published promoter-prediction systems, and show that the set of promoters
which are detected by this method seems to be substantially similar to that
detected by existing methods.
  Conclusions: The results presented here indicate that the promoter signal is
the strongest single motif-based signal in the non-coding functional fraction
of the genome. They also lend support to the belief that there exists a
substantial subset of promoter regions which share common features and are
detectable by a variety of computational methods.

increasing the magnetic field, the model undergoes a first-order quantum phase

jump in the content of entanglement available in the system. Above the critical
point, pairwise entanglement is shown to be non-vanishing and independent of
the boundary magnetic field for large chains. Based on this result, we provide
an analytical expression for the entanglement between arbitrary spins. Moreover
the effects of the quantum domains on the gapless region and for
antiferromagnetic anisotropy are numerically analysed. Finally multiparticle
entanglement properties are considered, from which we establish a
characterization of the critical anisotropy separating the gapless regime from
the kink-type phase.

is the root model based on the representation of the probability density as a

psi-function in analogy with quantum mechanics. The psi-function is represented
by an expansion in terms of an orthonormal set of functions. It is shown that
the introduction of the psi-function allows one to represent the Fisher
information matrix as well as statistical properties of the estimator of the
state vector (state estimator) in simple analytical forms. The chi-square test
is considered to test the hypotheses that the estimated vector converges to the
state vector of a general population. The method proposed may be applied to its
full extent to solve the statistical inverse problem of quantum mechanics (root
estimator of quantum states). In order to provide statistical completeness of
the analysis, it is necessary to perform measurements in mutually complementing
experiments (according to the Bohr terminology). The maximum likelihood
technique and likelihood equation are generalized in order to analyze quantum
mechanical experiments. It is shown that the requirement for the expansion to
be of a root kind can be considered as a quantization condition making it
possible to choose systems described by quantum mechanics from all statistical
models consistent, on average, with the laws of classical mechanics.

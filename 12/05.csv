the Local Supercluster (LSC) can explain the abnormal quadrupole and octopole
of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that were measured by WMAP and COBE.
The distortion needed to account for the low observed quadrupole is a spot in
the direction of the LSC with a temperature decrease of order \Delta T \approx
- 7 \mu K for \nu ~ 20 -- 90 Ghz photons. The temperature and density of the
hot gas which can generate such an effect are consistent with observations of
the X-ray background. If this hypothetic foreground is subtracted from the WMAP
data, we find that the amplitude of the quadrupole (l=2) is substantially
increased, and that the ``planarity'' of both the quadrupole and the octopole
(l=3) are weakened. For smaller scales the effect decays and, at least in our
simplified model, it does not affect the angular power spectrum at l>10.
Moreover, since the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect increases the temperature of
photons with frequencies above 218 GHz, observations sensitive in that range
(such as PLANCK's HFI) will be able to confirm whether the LSC indeed affects
the CMB.

the H2O emission is characterized by temperatures ~ 1500 K, significantly lower
than the temperatures that characterize the CO bandhead emission. The widths
for the H2O lines are also found to be smaller than those for the CO lines. We
construct a disk model for the emission that reproduces the CO and H2O
spectrum. In this model, the H2O lines originate at somewhat larger disk radii
(<= 0.3 AU) than the CO overtone lines (<= 0.1 AU). We find that the H2O
abundance is about a factor of 10 lower than the calculated chemical
equilibrium abundance. Large, approximately transonic, local line broadening is
required to fit the profile of the CO bandhead. If this velocity dispersion is
identified with turbulence, it is of significant interest regarding the
transport of angular momentum in disks. Large local broadening is also required
in modeling CO overtone emission from other young stellar objects, suggesting
that large turbulent velocities may be characteristic of the upper atmospheres

the SMC is driven at least in part by tidal forces due to the MW. The Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the other potential driver of star formation, but is
only near the SMC during the most recent burst. The poorly constrained LMC-SMC
orbit is our principal uncertainty. To explore the correspondence between
bursts and MW pericenter passages further, we model star formation in the SMC
using a combination of continuous and tidally-triggered star formation. The
behavior of the tidally-triggered mode is a strong inverse function of the
SMC-MW separation (preferred behavior ~ r^-5, resulting in a factor of ~100
difference in the rate of tidally-triggered star formation at pericenter and
apocenter). Despite the success of these closed-box evolutionary models in
reproducing the recent SMC star formation history and current chemical
abundance, they have some systematic shortcomings that are remedied by
postulating that a sizable infall event (~ 50% of the total gas mass) occured
about 4 Gyr ago. Regardless of whether this infall event is included, the
fraction of stars in the SMC that formed via a tidally triggered mode is > 10%

velocities of these galaxies. Assuming this is true, we are then able to use
the visibility, or ease of detection, of the discrete components as an
indication of the distance accuracy of the galaxies, comparing B- and I-band

obtained for inclinations between 48 and 65 degrees, and (c), that distances

proceeds along very different routes depending on whether it is the gas disk or
the stellar disk which first becomes unstable, as measured by the respective
Q-parameters. This in turn depends on the uncertain efficiency of energy
dissipation of the cold cloud component from which stars form. When the cold
gas cools efficiently and drives the instability, the galactic disk fragments
and forms a number of massive clumps of stars and gas. The clumps spiral to the
center of the galaxy in a few dynamical times and merge there to form a central
bulge component in a strong starburst. When the kinetic energy of the cold
clouds is dissipated at a lower rate, stars form from the gas in a more
quiescent mode, and an instability only sets in at later times, when the
surface density of the stellar disk has grown sufficiently high. The system
then forms a stellar bar, which channels gas into the center, evolves, and
forms a bulge whose stars are the result of a more extended star formation
history. We investigate the stability of the gas-stellar disks in both regimes,
as well as the star formation rates and element enrichment. We study the
morphology of the evolving disks, calculating spatially resolved colours from
the distribution of stars in age and metallicity, including dust absorption. We
then discuss morphological observations such as clumpy structures and chain
galaxies at high redshift as possible signatures of fragmenting, gas-rich

accretion onto the cores, and their orbital migration. We adopt a working model
for nascent protostellar disks with a wide variety of surface density
distributions in order to explore the range of diversity among extra solar
planetary systems. If some cores can acquire more mass than a critical value of
several Earth masses during the persistence of the disk gas, they would be able
to rapidly accrete gas and evolve into gas giant planets. The gas accretion
process is initially regulated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the
planets' gas envelope. Based on the assumption that the exponential decay of
the disk-gas mass occurs on the time scales $\sim 10^{6}-10^{7}$ years and that
the disk mass distribution is comparable to those inferred from the
observations of circumstellar disks of T Tauri stars, we carry out simulations
to predict the distributions of masses and semi major axes of extra solar
planets. Since planets' masses grow rapidly from $10 M_{\oplus}$ to $100
M_{\oplus}$, the gas giant planets rarely form with asymptotic masses in this
intermediate range. Our model predicts a paucity of extra solar planets with
mass in the range 10-$100 M_{\oplus}$ and semi major axis less than 3AU. We
refer to this deficit as a ``planet desert''. The effect of migration is to
sharpen the boundaries and to enhance the contrast of the planet desert. The
mass and semi major axis distributions generated in our simulations for the gas
giants are consistent with those of the known extra solar planets.

  Symposium 220,eds S. Ryder, D.J. Pisano, M. Walker & K.C. Freeman",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Isolated barred galaxies evolve by redistributing their internal angular
momentum, which is emitted mainly at the inner disc resonances and absorbed
mainly at the resonances in the outer disc and the halo. This causes the bar to
grow stronger and its pattern speed to decrease with time. A massive,
responsive halo enhances this process. I show correlations and trends between
the angular momentum absorbed by the halo and the bar strength, pattern speed
and morphology. It is thus possible to explain why some disc galaxies are
strongly barred, while others have no bar, or only a short bar or an oval. In
some cases, a bar is found also in the halo component. This ``halo bar'' is
triaxial, but more prolate-like, is shorter than the disc bar and rotates with
roughly the same pattern speed. I finally discuss whether bars can modify the

the state of a single qubit from a quantum-mechanical superposition to a
classical mixed state. This paper uses a Bloch-Redfield approach to study how,
in a system of two qubits, dissipation drives the bipartite state of the two
qubits from an entangled state to a product state. The measure used for
mixed-state entanglement is Wootters's formula for the entanglement of
formation. For qubits that start in an entangled state and are then decoupled,
entanglement is found to decay faster in general than the decoherence of single
qubit states by a factor $2/\log 2$ that can be obtained analytically in a
limiting case. We show that the dynamics of entanglement for realistic
parameters is different from that of fidelity: for some experimental parameters
a bipartite state loses fidelity much more rapidly than it loses entanglement.
These results are of some practical interest since entanglement is thought to
be the essential ``fuel'' for fast quantum algorithms.

built for the precise measurement of the branching ratio of pion beta decay,
pi+ -> pi0 e+ nu, at the Paul Scherrer Institute. The central part of the
detector is a 240-module spherical pure CsI calorimeter covering 3*pi sr solid
angle. The calorimeter is supplemented with an active collimator/beam degrader
system, an active segmented plastic target, a pair of low-mass cylindrical wire
chambers and a 20-element cylindrical plastic scintillator hodoscope. The whole
detector system is housed inside a temperature-controlled lead brick enclosure
which in turn is lined with cosmic muon plastic veto counters. Commissioning
and calibration data were taken during two three-month beam periods in
1999/2000 with pi+ stopping rates between 1.3*E3 pi+/s and 1.3*E6 pi+/s. We
examine the timing, energy and angular detector resolution for photons,
positrons and protons in the energy range of 5-150 MeV, as well as the response
of the detector to cosmic muons. We illustrate the detector signatures for the
assorted rare pion and muon decays and their associated backgrounds.

annihilating in the galactic halo. Although it is well known that evenly
distributed dark matter cannot account for the observed excess, if substantial
amounts of local dark matter substructure are present, the positron flux would
be enhanced, perhaps to the observed magnitude. In this paper, we attempt to
identify the nature of the substructure required to match the HEAT data,
including the location, size and density of any local dark matter clump(s).
Additionally, we attempt to assess the probability of such substructure being
present. We find that if the current density of neutralino dark matter is the
result of thermal production, very unlikely ($\sim 10^{-4}$ or less) conditions
must be present in local substructure to account for the observed excess.

Schwarzschild black holes to the effect that fluctuations of such modes provide
the horizon with a non-zero quantum mechanical width. This width then
effectively enforces a cut-off at much larger distances so that the entropy of
the thermal atmosphere is negligible in comparison with $A/4G$ for large black
holes. We generalize and improve this result by giving a relativistic argument
valid for any spherical black hole in any dimension. The result is again a
cut-off $L_c$ at a geometric mean of the Planck scale and the black hole
radius; in particular, $L_c^d \sim \frac{R}{T_H} \ell_p^{d-2}$. With this
cut-off, the entropy of the thermal atmosphere is again parametrically small in

of a singularity. The baryon number of the black hole is defined as that of the

polytope is multiplicial if all its faces are multiplexes. In this paper it is
proved that the flag vectors of multiplicial polytopes depend only on their
face vectors. A special class of multiplicial polytopes, also discovered by
Bisztriczky, is comprised of the ordinary polytopes. These are a natural
generalization of the cyclic polytopes. The flag vectors of ordinary polytopes
are determined. This is used to give a surprisingly simple formula for the
h-vector of the ordinary d-polytope with n+1 vertices and characteristic k:
h_i=binom{k-d+i}{i}+(n-k)binom{k-d+i-1}{i-1}, for i at most d/2. In addition, a
construction is given for 4-dimensional multiplicial polytopes having
two-thirds of their vertices on a single facet, answering a question of
Bisztriczky.

quantify the suitability of a particular set of variables and we suggests a
computationally efficient scheme to determine the best non-uniform time delay
embedding for modeling of time series. Our results are based on the assumption
that, in general, the variables which give the best local constant model will
also give the best nonlinear model. In a wide variety of experimental and

in the nonmaximally entangled state |psi> = cos\theta |+++> + i sin\theta |-->.
Here we show that Zheng's proof is not correct. Indeed it is the case that, for
the experiment considered by Zheng, the only state that admits a nonlocality
proof without inequalities is the maximally entangled state.

E 70, 016217 (2004)","10.1103/PhysRevE.70.016217",,"quant-ph",,"  We explore the dynamics of entanglement in classically chaotic systems by
considering a multiqubit system that behaves collectively as a spin system
obeying the dynamics of the quantum kicked top. In the classical limit, the
kicked top exhibits both regular and chaotic dynamics depending on the strength
of the chaoticity parameter $\kappa$ in the Hamiltonian. We show that the
entanglement of the multiqubit system, considered for both bipartite and
pairwise entanglement, yields a signature of quantum chaos. Whereas bipartite
entanglement is enhanced in the chaotic region, pairwise entanglement is
suppressed. Furthermore, we define a time-averaged entangling power and show
that this entangling power changes markedly as $\kappa$ moves the system from
being predominantly regular to being predominantly chaotic, thus sharply
identifying the edge of chaos. When this entangling power is averaged over
initial states, it yields a signature of global chaos. The qualitative behavior
of this global entangling power is similar to that of the classical Lyapunov
exponent.

destruction. We propose, demonstrate, and completely characterise a
\emph{quantum non-demolition} (QND) scheme for realising such a measurement
non-destructively. This scheme uses only linear optics and photo-detection of
ancillary modes to induce a strong non-linearity at the single photon level,
non-deterministically. We vary this QND measurement continuously into the weak
regime, and use it to perform a non-destructive test of complementarity in
quantum mechanics. Our scheme realises the most advanced general measurement of
a qubit: it is non-destructive, can be made in any basis, and with arbitrary
strength.

  (ICSSUR'8, Puebla, Mexico, 2003)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We numerically investigate the role of quantum fluctuations in
superresolution of optical objects. First, we confirm that when quantum
fluctuations are not taken into account, one can easily improve the resolution
by one order of magnitude beyond the diffraction limit. Then we investigate the
standard quantum limit of superresolution which is achieved for illumination of
an object by a light wave in a coherent state. We demonstrate that this limit
can be beyond the diffraction limit. Finally, we show that further improvement
of superresolution beyond the standard quantum limit is possible using the
object illumination by a multimode squeezed light.

  mechanics: A unified C*-algebraic approach","PhD thesis, University of Pretoria, May 2002, 87 pages",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP",,"  Quantum mechanics is essentially a statistical theory. Classical mechanics,
however, is usually not viewed as being inherently statistical. Nevertheless,
the latter can also be formulated statistically. Furthermore, a statistical
formulation of both can be expressed in terms of unital C*-algebras, in which
case it becomes clear that they have the same general structure, with quantum
mechanics a noncommutative generalization of the classical case. In purely
mathematical terms it is seen that quantum mechanics is a noncommutative
generalization of probability theory. The most important insight in this
respect is that the projection postulate of quantum mechanics is a
noncommutative conditional probability. This is the subject of Chapter 1 of the
thesis.
  As ergodic theory (the long term behaviour of a dynamical system) is done in
classical probability theory, it is then also done for noncommutative
probability theory in Chapter 2. In particular, generalizations of Khintchine's
recurrence theorem and a variation thereof for ergodic systems are proved, as
well as various characterizations of noncommutative ergodicity.
  Lastly, in Chapter 3, recurrence and ergodicity is then investigated from a
physical perspective in quantum and classical mechanics, by means of a quantum
mechanical analogue of Liouville's Theorem in classical mechanics which was
suggested in Chapter 1.

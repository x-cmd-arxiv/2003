astrometry (e.g., position angles and angular separations) with spectroscopy

signatures of AGN activity in their spectra. These objects are shown to be very
strongly correlated, with r_0=10.9^{+1.0}_{-1.2} Mpc and \gamma=2\pm 0.1, a
steeper slope than has been claimed in other recent works. No difference is
found in the clustering properties of radio-AGNs of different radio luminosity.
These results show that AGN-fuelled sources reside in dark matter halos more
massive than \sim 10^{13.4} M_{\sun}},higher the corresponding figure for
radio-quiet QSOs. This value can be converted into a minimum black hole mass
associated with radio-loud, AGN-fuelled objects of M_{BH}^{min}\sim 10^9
M_{\sun}. The above results then suggest -at least for relatively faint radio
objects -the existence of a threshold black hole mass associated with the onset
of significant radio activity such as that of radio-loud AGNs; however, once
the activity is triggered, there appears to be no evidence for a connection
between black hole mass and level of radio output. (abridged)

of 2 higher than at 1.4 GHz (\Pi_{1.4}\simeq 1.4%, based on NVSS data). For

  March/2004 issue of the Astronomical Journal",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We construct an integrated spectrum of the intermediate age, solar
metallicity Galactic cluster M67, from individual spectra of cluster members.
The integrated spectrum is used as a template to test our stellar population
synthesis (SPS) models, in an age and [Fe/H] regime where such models remain
largely untested. We show that our models predict a spectroscopic age of 3.5
+/- 0.5 Gyr for M67, in excellent agreement with the age we derive from the
color-magnitude diagram of the cluster. The same age is obtained when using
Hbeta, Hgamma or Hdelta as the age indicator. Our models predict the abundances
of Fe, Mg, C and N in agreement with detailed abundance analyses of cluster
stars, to within 0.1 dex. Encouraged by the high degree of consistency of our
models, we apply them to the study of the integrated spectrum of the central 3
arcsec of the compact elliptical galaxy M32. The resulting luminosity-weighted
age of the galaxy ranges between 2 and 3.5 Gyr, depending on the Balmer line
used. According to our models, the center of M32 seems to have a super-solar
light-weighted Fe abundance, ranging between [Fe/H] ~ +0.1 and +0.3, depending
on the Fe line adopted. Light-weighted abundance ratios found for the center of
M32 are as follows: [Mg/Fe] ~ -0.1 -- -0.2, [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] ~ 0. We find that
single SPS models with a solar-scaled abundance pattern cannot fit all the
Balmer and metal lines in the integrated spectrum of M32. There is a systematic
trend in the sense that bluer absorption lines indicate a younger age and a
higher [Fe/H]. This slight inconsistency can be due either to (unaccounted for)
abundance ratio effects on blue iron and Balmer line indices, or to a spread of
the ages of the stellar populations in M32. Current stellar population models
cannot break this degeneracy at the level of accuracy required to address this
problem.

  time granted by MM & YY in their first year",,,,"astro-ph",,"  A fully analytical formulation is developed to make dynamical friction
modeling more realistic. The rate for a satellite to decay its orbit in a host
galaxy halo is often severely overestimated when applying ChandraSekhar's
formula without correcting for the tidal loss of the satellite and the
adiabactic growth of the host galaxy potential over the Hubble time. As a
satellite decays to the inner and denser region of the host galaxy, the high
ambient density speeds up their exchange of energy and angular momentum, but
shrinks the Roche lobe of the satellite by tides. Eventually both processes of
orbital decay and tidal stripping hang up altogether once the satellite is
light enough. These competing processes can be modeled analytically for a
satellite if we parametrize the massloss history by an empirical formula. We
also incorporate the adiabatic contraction of orbits due to growth of the host
potential well. Observed dwarf galaxies often show a finite density core, which
determines how much inwards its remnants could be delivered to the host galaxy.
Ghost streams or remnant cores or globular clusters of satellites should
populate preferentially the outer halo (e.g., the Magellanic stream and the
Ursa Minor dwarf), rather than the inner halo (e.g., the Sgr stream and the
Omega-cen cluster). Massloss due to strong tides in the inner galaxy also makes
it problematic for any small central black holes in nuclei of satellite
galaxies to decay in orbit and merge into the center of the host galaxy.

be used to classify stars and brown dwarfs. This set of four filters, spanning
the H band, can be used to identify molecular features unique to brown dwarfs,
such as H2O and CH4. The four filters are centered at 1.495 um (H2O), 1.595 um
(continuum), 1.66 um (CH4), and 1.75 um (H2O). Using two H2O filters allows us
to solve for individual objects' reddenings. This can be accomplished by
constructing a color-color-color cube and rotating it until the reddening
vector disappears. We created a model of predicted color-color-color values for
different spectral types by integrating filter bandpass data with spectra of
known stars and brown dwarfs. We validated this model by making photometric
measurements of seven known L and T dwarfs, ranging from L1 - T7.5. The
photometric measurements agree with the model to within +/-0.1 mag, allowing us
to create spectral indices for different spectral types. We can classify A
through early M stars to within +/-2 spectral types, late-type M and L dwarfs
to within +/-0.3 spectral types and T dwarfs to within +/-0.1 spectral types
1-sigma. Thus, we can distinguish between a T1 and a T3 dwarf. The four
physical bands can be converted into two reddening-free indices, mu1 and mu2,
and an extinction, AV, for the individual object. This technique, which is
equivalent to extremely low resolution spectroscopy, can be used to survey
large areas to provide rough spectral classifications for all the stars in the
area, ranging down to the coolest brown dwarfs. It should prove particularly
useful in young clusters where reddening can be high.

Exquisite measurements of $C_l$ over a wide range of multipoles from the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) has opened up the possibility to
deconvolve the primordial power spectrum for a given set of cosmological
parameters (base model). We implement an improved (error sensitive)
Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm on the measured angular power spectrum
from WMAP assuming a concordance cosmological model. The most prominent feature
of the recovered $P(k)$ is a sharp, infra-red cut off on the horizon scale. The
resultant $C_l$ spectrum using the recovered spectrum has a likelihood far
better than a scale invariant, or, `best fit' scale free spectra
($\Delta\ln{\cal L}=25$ {\it w.r.t.} Harrison Zeldovich, and, $\Delta\ln{\cal
L}=11$ {\it w.r.t.} power law with $n_s=0.95$). The recovered $P(k)$ has a
localized excess just below the cut-off which leads to great improvement of
likelihood over the simple monotonic forms of model infra-red cut-off spectra
considered in the post WMAP literature. The recovered $P(k)$, in particular,
the form of infra-red cut-off is robust to small changes in the cosmological
parameters. We show that remarkably similar form of infra-red cutoff is known
to arise in very reasonable extensions and refinements of the predictions from
simple inflationary scenarios. Our method can be extended to other cosmological
observations such as the measured matter power spectrum and, in particular, the
much awaited polarization spectrum from WMAP.

detected just outside the ASM error box, it was never associated with the GRB
because it was not clearly fading and because no optical afterglow was ever
discovered. We recently made deep optical observations of the AX/RX
J1606.8+8130 position, which is blank to a limit of V > 24.3 and I > 24.0,
implying an X-ray-to-optical flux ratio f{X}/f{V} > 500. In view of this
extreme limit, we analyze and reevaluate the ASCA and ROSAT data and conclude
that the X-ray source AX/RX J1606.8+8130 was indeed the afterglow of GRB
970815, which corresponds to an optically ``dark'' GRB. Alternatively, if AX/RX
J1608+8130 is discovered to be a persistent source, then it could be associated
with EGRET source 3EG J1621+8203, whose error box includes this position.

quasi-one- dimensional (Q1D) organic conductor (Per)2Pt(mnt)2 (where Per =
perylene and mnt = maleonitriledithiolate), which has a charge density wave
(CDW) ground state at zero magnetic field below 8 K. We find that the CDW
ground state is suppressed with moderate magnetic fields of order 20 T, as
expected from a mean field theory treatment of Pauli effects[W. Dieterich and
P. Fulde, Z. Physik 265, 239 - 243 (1973)]. At higher magnetic fields, a new,
density wave state with sub-phases is observed in the range 20 to 50 T, which
is reminiscent of the cascade of field induced, quantized, spin density wave
phases (FISDW) observed in the Bechgaard salts. The new density wave state,
which we tenatively identify as a field induced charge density wave state
(FICDW), is re-entrant to a low resistance state at even higher fields, of
order 50 T and above. Unlike the FISDW ground state, the FICDW state is only
weakly orbital, and appears for all directions of magnetic field. Our findings
are substantiated by electrical resistivity, magnetization, thermoelectric, and
Hall measurements. We discuss our results in light of theoretical work
involving magnetic field dependent Q1D CDW ground states in high magnetic
fields [D. Zanchi, A. Bjelis, and G. Montambaux, Phys. Rev. B 53, (1996)1240;

stars (BNSs) by performing dynamical simulations in full general relativity.
Evolving quasiequilibrium (QE) binaries that begin at different separations, we
bracket the location of the ISCO by distinguishing stable circular orbits from
unstable plunges. We study Gamma=2 polytropes of varying compactions in both
corotational and irrotational equal-mass binaries. For corotatonal binaries we
find an ISCO orbital angular frequency somewhat smaller than that determined by
applying turning-point methods to QE initial data. For the irrotational
binaries the initial data sequences terminate before reaching a turning point,
but we find that the ISCO frequency is reached prior to the termination point.
Our findings suggest that the ISCO frequency varies with compaction but does
not depend strongly on the stellar spin. Since the observed gravitational wave
signal undergoes a transition from a nearly periodic ``chirp'' to a burst at
roughly twice the ISCO frequency, the measurement of its value by laser
interferometers (e.g LIGO) will be important for determining some of the
physical properites of the underlying stars

10^-17 requires a several order of magnitude increase in muon intensity and a
high resolution, sigma = 0.1 MeV/c of the electron's momentum.
  We present results of a pattern recognition and track momentum reconstruction
algorithm that relies on a Kalman filter approach. Background from captured
protons, neutrons, photons and muon decay in orbit were generated by GEANT. The
effective average straw tube background rate was 800 kHz.
  The pattern recognition proceeds in two stages. In the first, simple
considerations using only straw tube center coordinates, without drift time
information, were applied to reduce the background to a manageable level. Then
the drift time information is incorporated and a Deterministic Annealing Filter
applied to reach the final level of background suppression and to provide a
starting point for the track momentum reconstruction using the Kalman filter.
This procedure reduces the simulated background by a factor 800 with small,
(2.7%), losses in real tracker hits.
  The momentum resolution of the tracker is sigma = 0.12 MeV/c and the
acceptance for muon conversion events with momentum above 103.6 MeV/c is 22%.
These numbers do not differ significantly from the values obtained without
background.
  The expected number of events from muon decay in orbit (main background) in
which the decay electron has momentum greater than 100 MeV/c is 0.3, compared
to 6.5 muon-electron conversion events above the same threshold for R_mu_e

wrapped on the K3 manifold times a torus, allowing the volume of the internal

of the dual R-R sector field to which it couples. After wrapping, a brane is
expected to behave as a BPS monopole, where the Higgs vacuum expectation value
is set by the size of the K3. We determine the moduli space of an arbitrary
number of these wrapped branes by introducing a time dependent perturbation of
the static solution, and expanding the supergravity equations of motion to
determine the dynamics of this perturbation, in the low velocity limit. The
result is the hyper-Kahler generalisation of the Euclidean Taub-NUT metric
presented by Gibbons and Manton. We note that our results also pertain to the
behavior of bound states of Kaluza-Klein monopoles and wrapped NS5-branes in

with local gauge symmetry and superstring theories including gravity. In its
original version, known as AdS/CFT duality, the correspondence involves N=4
Super Yang-Mills theory in four space-time dimensions, which is a
superconformal theory with a high degree of supersymmetry, thus very far from
describing the physical world.
  We explore extensions of the correspondence towards less supersymmetric and
non-conformal gauge theories. Specifically, we study gauge theories in three
and four dimensions, with eight or four preserved supersymmetries and
exhibiting a scale anomaly, by means of supergravity solutions describing
D-brane configurations of type II string theory. We show how relevant
information on these gauge theories can be extracted from the dual classical
solutions, both at the perturbative (e.g. running coupling constant, chiral
anomaly) and non-perturbative level (e.g. effective superpotential).

a PFB is given by a right co-module algebra ${\cal P}$ over a Hopf algebra
${\cal H}$ with a mapping $\Delta_R:{\cal P}\to{\cal P}\otimes{\cal H}$. In our
case ${\cal P}$ is the (commutative) C*-algebra of complex-valued continuous
functions on the total space P and ${\cal H}$ is the Hopf algebra of
complex-valued functions on the structure group G. These underlying spaces are
endowed with a topology only. The subalgebra ${\cal B}$ of $\Delta_R$-invariant
elements is identified with the algebra of complex-valued functions on the base
space B. In order to define horizontal one-forms, a differential calculus is
needed. Since no a priori differential structure is assumed, we use the
calculus of the universal differential envelope $\Omega^\bullet({\cal P})$
which can be defined on any unital algebra. A connection on the PFB is then
defined by a splitting of the universal one-forms as a direct sum of horizontal
and vertical subspaces : $\Omega^1({\cal P})=\Gamma_{hor}\oplus\Gamma_{ver}$.
In case of a strong connection in a trivial PFB, the general expression and
gauge transformation of the connection one-form and the curvature two-form are
given. A locally trivial PFB can be constructed through a gluing procedure of a
cover of the algebra ${\cal P}$ (see this meeting's poster session P112, where
examples are given).

how to establish a relationship between low-energy, non-perturbative QCD and
nuclear phenomenology which includes both nuclear matter and finite nuclei. We
develop a microscopic covariant description of nuclear many-body dynamics
constrained by chiral symmetry and in-medium QCD sum rules. A relativistic
point-coupling model is derived, based on an effective Lagrangian with
density-dependent contact interactions between nucleons. These interactions are
constructed from chiral one- and two-pion exchange, combined with the large
isoscalar nucleon self-energies that arise through changes in the quark
condensate and the quark density at finite baryon density. Nuclear binding and
saturation are almost completely generated by chiral (two-pion exchange)
fluctuations in combination with Pauli effects, whereas strong scalar and
vector fields of about equal magnitude and opposite sign, induced by changes of
the QCD vacuum in the presence of baryonic matter, generate the large effective
spin-orbit potential in finite nuclei. Promising results are found for the
nuclear matter equation of state and for the bulk and single-nucleon properties
of finite nuclei.

to provide an optimal environment in which to deploy these mesoscale simulation

the microtubule filaments, thus preventing their disintegration following
hydrolysis and enhancing further polymerization. Using mean-field rate
equations and explicit numerical simulations, we show that the density of MAP
(number of MAP per tubulin in the microtubule) has to exceed a critical value
$\rho_{c}$ to stabilize the structure against de-polymerization. At lower
densities $\rho < \rho_{c}$, the microtubule population consists mostly of
short polymers with exponentially decaying length distribution, whereas at
$\rho > \rho_{c}$ the average length increases linearly with time and the
microtubules ultimately extend to the cell boundary. Using experimentally
measured values of various parameters, the critical ratio of MAP to tubulin
required for unlimited growth is seen to be of the order of 1:100 or even
smaller.

KS theorem. The fidelity to the Bell states which is larger than 1/2 is
sufficient for the experimental confirmation of the KS theorem. Hence, the
Werner state is enough to test experimentally the KS theorem. Furthermore, it
is possible to test the KS theorem experimentally using uncorrelated states. An
$n$-partite uncorrelated state violates the $n$-partite inequality derived here

processes with zero mean and delta function correlation times, we derive an
exact equation of motion describing the dissipative dynamics for a system of n
qubits. We then apply this model to study the effect of noise on the quantum
teleportation and a generic quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. For the quantum
CNOT gate, we study the effect of noise on a set of one- and two-qubit quantum
gates, and show that the results can be assembled together to investigate the
quality of a quantum CNOT gate operation. We compute the averaged gate fidelity
and gate purity for the quantum CNOT gate, and investigate phase, bit-flip, and
flip-flop errors during the CNOT gate operation. The effects of direct
inter-qubit coupling and fluctuations on the control fields are also studied.
We discuss the limitations and possible extensions of this model. In sum, we
demonstrate a simple model that enables us to investigate the effect of noise
in arbitrary quantum circuits under realistic device conditions.

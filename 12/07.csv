determined from measured orbital dynamics and sufficient spectral and
photometric information for their placement on a theoretical HR diagram. Our
sample consists of 115 low mass (M < 2.0 Msun) stars, 27 pre-main sequence and
88 main sequence. We use a variety of available pre-main sequence evolutionary
calculations to test the consistency of predicted stellar masses with
dynamically determined masses. Despite substantial improvements in model
physics over the past decade, large systematic discrepancies still exist
between empirical and theoretically derived masses. For main-sequence stars,
all models considered predict masses consistent with dynamical values above 1.2
Msun, some models predict consistent masses at solar or slightly lower masses,
and no models predict consistent masses below 0.5 Msun but rather all models
systematically under-predict such low masses by 5-20%. The failure at low
masses stems from the poor match of most models to the empirical main-sequence
below temperatures of 3800 K where molecules become the dominant source of
opacity and convection is the dominant mode of energy transport. For the
pre-main sequence sample we find similar trends. There is generally good
agreement between predicted and dynamical masses above 1.2 Msun for all models.
Below 1.2 Msun and down to 0.3 Msun (the lowest mass testable) most
evolutionary models systematically under-predict the dynamically determined
masses by 10-30% on average with the Lyon group models (e.g. Baraffe et al.
1998) predicting marginally consistent masses *in the mean* though with large
scatter.

does not. Furthermore, the delays determine the synchronized dynamics, leading
to the emergence of a wide range of new collective behavior which the
individual units are incapable of producing in isolation.

minimal two-body Hamiltonian depending on just five measurable parameters of a
Feshbach resonance, which accurately determines all low energy binary
scattering observables, in particular, the molecular conversion efficiency of
just two atoms. Based on this description of the microscopic collision
phenomena, we use the many-body theory of T. Koehler and K. Burnett [Phys. Rev.

Landau-Zener, configuration interaction, and two level mean field calculations

reveal a remarkable insensitivity of the molecular conversion efficiency with
respect to both the details of the microscopic binary collision physics and the
coherent nature of the Bose-Einstein condensed gas, provided that the magnetic
field strength is varied linearly. We provide the reasons for this universality
of the molecular production achieved by linear ramps of the magnetic field
strength, and identify the Landau-Zener coefficient determined by F.H. Mies et

cross sections and forward-backward asymmetries, photon-pair, W-pair, Z-pair,
single-W and single-Z cross sections, electroweak gauge boson couplings, W mass
and width and W decay branching ratios. Also, an investigation of the
interference of photon and Z-boson exchange is presented, and colour
reconnection and Bose-Einstein correlation analyses in W-pair production are
combined. The main changes with respect to the experimental results presented

sections and gauge couplings, all measured at LEP-2, and the LEP heavy-flavour

equations is considered on bounded smooth domains with no-slip boundary
conditions or on periodic domains. Asymptotic regularity conditions are
presented to ensure that the convergence of a Leray-Hopf weak solution to its
weak omega-limit set (weak in the sense of the weak topology of the space H of
square-integrable divergence-free velocity fields) are achieved also in the
strong topology of H. In particular, if a weak omega-limit set is bounded in
the space V of velocity fields with square-integrable vorticity then the
attraction to the set holds also in the strong topology of H. Corresponding
results for the strong convergence towards the weak global attractor of Foias
and Temam are also presented.

fluctuations in the magnitude of the elliptic flow. In this Letter, using a

identify optimal experimental conditions and observables for investigating the

known to be sensitive to the density-dependence of the symmetry energy are
examined as a function of impact parameter for both reaction systems. In
particular, the strength of isospin transport/diffusion is studied by using
rapidity distributions of free nucleons and their isospin asymmetries. An
approximate isospin equilibrium is established even for peripheral collisions
with a very soft symmetry energy at 30 MeV/A. At 400 MeV/A, however, a strong
isospin translucency is observed even in most central collisions with either
soft or stiff symmetry energies. Origins of these observations and their
implications to determining the EOS of neutron-rich matter at the Rare Isotope
Accelerator (RIA) are discussed.

relativistic mean field theory. Zr and Sn isotopes have received tremendous
attention due to various reasons, including the predicted giant halos in the
neutron-rich Zr isotopes, the unique feature of being robustly spherical in the
region of $^{100}$Sn $\sim$ $^{132}$Sn and the particular interest of Sn
isotopes to nuclear astrophysics. Furthermore, four (semi-) magic neutron
numbers, 40, 50, 82 and 126, make these two isotopic chains particularly
important to test the pairing correlations and the deformations in a
microscopic model. In the present work, we carry out a systematic study of Zr
and Sn isotopes from the proton drip line to the neutron drip line with
deformation effects, pairing correlations and blocking effects for nuclei with
odd number of neutrons properly treated. A constrained calculation with
quadrupole deformations is performed to find the absolute minimum for each
nucleus on the deformation surface. All ground-state properties, including the
separation energies, the odd-even staggerings, the nuclear radii, the
deformations and the single-particle spectra are analyzed and discussed in
detail.

derived for certain special cases satisfy these optimality conditions. We then
consider state sets with strong symmetry properties, and show that the optimal

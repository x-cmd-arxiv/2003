be explained by the recent predictions of K-shell absorption from neutral and
ionized atomic oxygen. We identify the K alpha and K beta absorption lines from
neutral oxygen, as well as the S=3/2 absorption edge. The expected S=1/2 edge
is not detected in these data due to overlap with instrumental features. We
also identify the K alpha absorption lines from singly and doubly ionized

adjust the absolute wavelength scale for theoretical predictions of the

the observations at different scales. We examine this scalar field behavior at

black holes (SMBHs) in disk galaxies appear to be smaller than those in
elliptical galaxies in the same luminosity range. We consider the formation of
SMBHs by radiation drag (Poynting-Robertson effect), which extracts angular
momentum from interstellar matter and thereby drives the mass accretion onto a
galactic center. In particular, we quantitatively scrutinize the efficiency of
radiation drag in a galaxy composed of bulge and disk, and elucidate the
relation between the final mass of SMBH and the bulge-to-disk ratio of the
galaxy. As a result, it is found that the BH-to-galaxy mass ratio, $M_{\rm
BH}/M_{\rm galaxy}$, decreases with a smaller bulge-to-disk ratio, due to the
effects of geometrical dilution and opacity, and is reduced maximally by two
orders of magnitude, resulting in $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm galaxy}\approx 10^{-5}$.
In contrast, if only the bulge components in galaxies are focused, the
BH-to-bulge mass ratio becomes $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm bulge}\approx 10^{-3}$, which
is similar to that found in elliptical galaxies. Thus, it turns out that the
mass of SMBH primarily correlates with a bulge, not with a disk, consistently
with observational data.

continuity in the dimension can be used to lift ambiguities which appear in
calculations at fixed dimension. We show that the existence of a HT phase in

requires that this mechanism works to all orders. On the other hand, most poles
at negative values of the dimensional parameter (where the free energy density
is not well-defined, but RG flows can be studied) persist and reflect the fact
that for special negative values of the dimension, finite-size corrections
become leading terms. We show that the inverse problem is also free of small
denominator problems and that the initial values of the scaling variables can

interaction has two contributions: one is specific of liquid crystals and
results from the deformation of the director field close to the particles or to
the interface, while the other is generic and results from wetting and surface
tension effects.
  Deep in the nematic phase the director field of long cylindrical colloids,
with strong homeotropic anchoring, exhibits two half-integer defect lines. As
the colloid moves towards the interface, the director configuration changes
through a series of discontinuous transitions, where one or two of the defects
are annihilated. In addition, the NI interface bends towards the colloid in
order to minimize the elastic free energy in the nematic. In the isotropic
phase, the colloid is surrounded by a thin nematic layer that reduces the
surface free energy under favorable wetting conditions.
  The interaction has a well-defined minimum near the interface. In this region
the director and interfacial structures are complex and cannot be described
analytically. Using the numerical results for the Landau-de Gennes free energy
in the harmonic region, we obtained simple scaling laws for the (linear) force

Carlson-Carone-Zobin (CCZ) formalism of Lorentz-invariant NC field theory
provided that the fields are `independent' of the `internal' coordinates
$\theta^{\mu\nu}$. A new regularization scheme called NC regularizatioon is
then proposed, which removes the Lorentz-invariant IR singularity from the
theory. It requires the usual UV limit $\Lambda\to \infty$ to be accompanied
with the commutative limit $a\to 0$ with $\Lambda^2a^2$ fixed, where $a$ is the
length parameter in the theory. The new UV limit gives the usual renormalized
amplitude of the one-loop self-energy diagram of $\phi^3$ model. It is shown
that the new regularization is gauge-invariant, that is, the non-transverse
part of the vacuum polarization in QED is automatically transverse in
Lorentz-invariant NCQED but the two transverse pieces, one of which is already
transverse in QED, possesses Lorentz-invariant IR singularity which should be
`subtracted off' at zero external momentum squared. The subtraction leads to
the same result as the renormalized one by Pauli-Villars or dimensional
regularizations. Other diagrams with three-point vertices which contribute to
the photon self-energy in Lorentz-non-invariant NCQED all vanish due to Lorentz
invariance under the assumption adopted, while the tadpole diagram gives a
finite contribution to the charge renormalization which vanishes if $
Lambda^2a^2\to 0$. Lorentz-invariant NC $\phi^4$ and scalar Yukawa models are
also discussed in the one-loop approximation. A comment is made that
Lorentz-invariance might lead to a decoupling of U(1) part from SU(N) in NC
U(N) gauge theory.

special class of Galois comodules termed principal comodules is introduced.
These are defined as Galois comodules that are projective over their comodule
endomorphism rings. A complete description of principal comodules in the case a
background ring is a field is found. In particular it is shown that a (finitely
generated and projective) right comodule of an $A$-coring $\mathcal C$ is
principal provided a lifting of the canonical map is a split epimorphism in the
category of left $\mathcal C$-comodules. This description is then used to
characterise principal extensions or non-commutative principal bundles.
Specifically, it is proven that, over a field, any entwining structure
consisting of an algebra $A$, a coseparable coalgebra $C$ and a bijective
entwining map $\psi$ together with a group-like element in $C$ give rise to a
principal extension provided the lifted canonical map is surjective. Induction

  geometric objects",,,,"math.GM",,"  Physical geometry studies mutual disposition of geometrical objects and
points in space, or space-time, which is described by the distance function $
d$, or by the world function $\sigma =d^{2}/2$. One suggests a new general
method of the physical geometry construction. The proper Euclidean geometry is
described in terms of its world function $\sigma_{\mathrm{E}}$. Any physical
geometry $\mathcal{G}$ is obtained from the Euclidean geometry as a result of
replacement of the Euclidean world function $\sigma_{\mathrm{E}}$ by the world
function $\sigma $ of $\mathcal{G}$. This method is very simple and effective.
It introduces a new geometric property: nondegeneracy of geometry. Using this
method, one can construct deterministic space-time geometries with primordially
stochastic motion of free particles and geometrized particle mass. Such a
space-time geometry defined properly (with quantum constant as an attribute of
geometry) allows one to explain quantum effects as a result of the statistical
description of the stochastic particle motion (without a use of quantum
principles).

hydrophobicity sequence of a protein correlates with its pattern of surface
exposure. We have assessed the statistical significance of this correlation for
several hydrophobicity scales in the literature, and find that the computed
correlations are significant but far from optimal. We show that this less than
optimal correlation arises primarily from the large degree of mutations that
naturally occurring proteins can tolerate. Lesser effects are due in part to
forces other than hydrophobicity and we quantify this by analyzing the surface
exposure distributions of all amino acids. Lastly we show that our database
findings are consistent with those found from an off-lattice hydrophobic-polar

correspondence with the $S$-matrix pole. IS can have a positive as well as a
negative energy and can be treated as a generalization of the bound states
embedded in continuum on the case of discrete spectrum states. The formation of
IS in the spectrum of a quantum system is studied using a simple rank--2
separable potential with harmonic oscillator form factors. Some physical
applications are discussed, in particular, we propose a separable $NN$
potential supporting IS that describes the deuteron binding energy and the
s-wave triplet and singlet scattering phase shifts. We use this potential to
examine the so-called problem of the three-body bound state collapse discussed
in literature. We show that the variation of the two-body IS energy causes
drastic changes of the binding energy and of the spectrum of excited states of
the three-nucleon system.

neutral atoms in microtraps, when anharmonic traps are employed and the effects
of finite temperature are also taken into account. Both the anharmonicity and
the temperature are found to pose limitations to the performance of the quantum
gate. We present a quantitative analysis of the problem and show that the phase
gate has a high quality performance for the experimental values that are
presently or in the near future achievable in the laboratory.

"quant-ph/0312067","Marie Lalire","Philippe Jorrand, Marie Lalire","Toward a Quantum Process Algebra","20 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum computations operate in the quantum world. For their results to be
useful in any way, there is an intrinsic necessity of cooperation and
communication controlled by the classical world. As a consequence, full formal
descriptions of algorithms making use of quantum principles must take into
account both quantum and classical computing components and assemble them so
that they communicate and cooperate. This paper aims at defining a high level
language allowing the description of classical and quantum programming, and
their cooperation. Since process algebras provide a framework to model
cooperating computations and have well defined semantics, they have been chosen
as a basis for this language. Starting with a classical process algebra, this
paper explains how to transform it for including quantum computation. The
result is a quantum process algebra with its operational semantics, which can
be used to fully describe quantum algorithms in their classical context.

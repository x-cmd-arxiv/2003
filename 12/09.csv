observations are affected by sky coverage, density of source galaxies,
inclusion of CMB experiments, simultaneou fitting of non--dark energy
parameters, and the parametrization of the history of the dark energy
equation-of-state parameter w(z). We find tomographic shear-shear power spectra
on large angular scales (l<1000) inferred from all-sky observations, in
combination with Planck, can achieve sigma(w0)=0.06 and sigma(wa)=0.09 assuming
the equation-of-state parameter is given by w(z)=w0+wa(1-a(z)) and that nine
other matter content and primordial power spectrum parameters are
simultaneously fit. Taking parameters other than w0, wa and Omegam to be
completely fixed by the CMB we find errors on w0 and wa that are only 10% and
30% better respectively, justifying this common simplifying assumption. We also
study `dark energy tomography': reconstuction of w(z) assumed to be constant
within each of five independent redshift bins. With smaller-scale information
included by use of the Jain & Taylor ratio statistic we find sigma(wi)<0.1 for
all five redshift bins and sigma(wi)<0.02 for both bins at z<0.8. Finally,
addition of cosmic shear can also reduce errors on quantities already
determined well by the CMB. We find the sum of neutrino masses can be
determined to +-0.013eV and that the primordial power specrum power-law index,
ns, as well as dns/dlnk, can be determined more than a factor of two better
than by Planck alone. These improvements may be highly valuable since the lower
bound on the sum of neutrino masses is 0.06eV as inferred from atmospheric
neutrino oscillations, and slow-roll models of inflation predict non-zero
dns/dlnk at the forecasted error levels when |n_S-1|>0.04.

Knop et al. 2003), together with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift
parameter from CMB data (WMAP, CBI, and ACBAR), and the large scale structure
(LSS) growth factor from 2dF galaxy survey data. We parametrize $\rho_X(z)$ as
a continuous function, given by interpolating its amplitudes at equally spaced
$z$ values in the redshift range covered by SN Ia data, and a constant at
larger $z$ (where $\rho_X(z)$ is only weakly constrained by CMB data). We
assume a flat universe, and use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique
in our analysis. We find that the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ is constant
for $0 \la z \la 0.5$ and increases with redshift $z$ for $0.5 \la z \la 1$ at
68.3% confidence level, but is consistent with a constant at 95% confidence
level. For comparison, we also give constraints on a constant equation of state
for the dark energy.
  Flux-averaging of SN Ia data is required to yield cosmological parameter
constraints that are free of the bias induced by weak gravitational lensing
\citep{Wang00b}. We set up a consistent framework for flux-averaging analysis
of SN Ia data, based on \cite{Wang00b}. We find that flux-averaging of SN Ia
data leads to slightly lower $\Omega_m$ and smaller time-variation in
$\rho_X(z)$. This suggests that a significant increase in the number of SNe Ia
from deep SN surveys on a dedicated telescope \citep{Wang00a} is needed to
place a robust constraint on the time-dependence of the dark energy density.

fitted with a power-law central slope that is unmodified by tidal forces even
after the tidal stripping of over 99% of the initial mass and an exponential

advocated by Stoehr et al. in 2002 relied on the flattening of the dark matter
(DM) halo central density cusps by gravitational tides, enabling the observed
satellites to be embedded within DM halos with maximum circular velocities as
large as 60 km/s. In contrast, our results suggest that tidal interactions do
not provide the mechanism for associating the dwarf spheroidal satellites
(dSphs) of the Milky Way with the most massive substructure halos expected in a
CDM universe. We compare the predicted velocity dispersion profiles of Fornax
and Draco to observations, assuming that they are embedded in CDM halos. Models
with isotropic and tangentially anisotropic velocity distributions for the
stellar component fit the data only if the surrounding DM halos have maximum
circular velocities in the range 20-35 km/s. If the dSphs are embedded within
halos this large then the overabundance of satellites within the concordance
LCDM cosmological model is significantly alleviated, but this still does not

relation defined for normal galaxies. 111 Markarian (Mrk) IRAS galaxies were
observed at the Nancay radiotelescope. These measurements are complemented by
data from the literature to form a sample of 105 unbarred and 113 barred Mrk
IRAS galaxies. Barred galaxies have lower total and bias-corrected HI masses
than unbarred galaxies, and this is true for both Mrk IRAS and normal galaxies.
This robust result suggests that bars funnel the HI gas toward the center of
the galaxy where it becomes molecular before forming new stars. The Mrk IRAS
galaxies have higher bias-corrected HI masses than normal galaxies. They also
show significant departures from the TF relation, both in the B and K bands.
The most deviant points from the TF relation tend to have a strong far-infrared
luminosity and a low oxygen abundance. These results suggest that a fraction of

Its spectrum is well fit by a multi-color disk blackbody model used to fit
optically thick standard accretion disks around black holes. The luminosity
derived for this IXO is 1.1x10^41 erg/s in the 0.5 - 10 keV band making it one
of the most luminous discovered to date. The large source luminosity implies a
large mass black hole if the source is radiating at the Eddington rate. On the
other hand, the inner disk temperature determined here is too high for such a
massive object given the standard accretion disk model. In addition to the IXO
we find that the nuclear source in this galaxy has dimmed by at least a factor
of several thousand in the eight years since the ROSAT HRI observations.

consider the dynamical evolution of gas in dwarf galaxies using a

the effects of radiative transfer and photoionization. We include a
physically-motivated star formation recipe and consider the effects of
feedback. Our results indicate that star formation in the severe environment of
dwarf galaxies is a difficult and inefficient process. For intermediate mass
systems, such as the dSphs around the Galaxy, star formation can proceed with
in early cosmic epochs despite the intense background UV flux. Triggering
processes such as merger events, collisions, and tidal disturbance can lead to
density enhancements, reducing the recombination timescale, allowing gas to
cool and star formation to proceed. However, the star formation and gas
retention efficiency may vary widely in galaxies with similar dark matter
potentials, because they depend on many factors, such as the baryonic fraction,
external perturbation, IMF, and background UV intensity. We suggest that the
presence of very old stars in these dwarf galaxies indicates that their initial
baryonic to dark matter content was comparable to the cosmic value. This
constraint suggests that the initial density fluctuation of baryonic matter may
be correlated with that of the dark matter. For the more massive dwarf
elliptical galaxies, the star formation efficiency and gas retention rate is
much higher. Their mass to light ratio is regulated by star formation feedback,
and is expected to be nearly independent of their absolute luminosity. The
results of our theoretical models reproduce the observed $M/L-M_v$ correlation.

framework of the spherical infall model. We present a new formulation of
spherical collapse including non-radial motions, and compare the analytical
profiles with a set of high-resolution N-body simulations ranging from galactic
to cluster scales. We argue that the dark matter density profile is entirely
determined by the initial conditions, which are described by only two
parameters: the height of the primordial peak and the smoothing scale. These
are physically meaningful quantities in our model, related to the mass and
formation time of the halo. Angular momentum is dominated by velocity
dispersion, and it is responsible for the shape of the density profile near the
centre. The phase-space density of our simulated haloes is well described by a
power-law profile, rho/sigma^3 = 10^{1.46\pm0.04} (rho_c/Vvir^3)
(r/Rvir)^{-1.90\pm0.05}. Setting the eccentricity of particle orbits according
to the numerical results, our model is able to reproduce the mass distribution
of individual haloes.

stellar masses for the companions, we estimate the mass accretion rate

iso-velocity contours, suggestive of a differential rotation. A comparison of
HI data with the predictions from tidal models for the SMC evolution suggests
that the central region of the SMC corresponds to the central, disk- or
bar-like, component left from the rotationally supported SMC disk prior to its
last two encounters with the Large Magellanic Cloud. In this scenario, the
velocity gradient is expected as a left-over from the original, pre-encounter,
angular momentum. We have derived the HI rotation curve and the mass model for
the SMC. This rotation curve rapidly rises to about 60 km/s up to the turnover
radius of ~3 kpc. A stellar mass-to-light ratio of about unity is required to
match the observed rotation curve, suggesting that a dark matter halo is not
needed to explain the dynamics of the SMC. A set of derived kinematic
parameters agrees well with the assumptions used in tidal theoretical models
that led to a good reproduction of observational properties of the Magellanic

history. In the previous formulation, sources are assumed to be distributed
homogeneously on the sky. This fundamental assumption is not realistic in many
applications. In this work, by making use of the point field theory, we derive
general analytic formulae for the confusion problems with arbitrary
distribution and correlation functions. As a typical example, we apply these
new formulae to the source confusion of infrared galaxies. We first calculate
the confusion statistics for power-law galaxy number counts as a test case.
When the slope of differential number counts, \gamma, is steep, the confusion
limits becomes much brighter and the probability distribution function (PDF) of
the fluctuation field is strongly distorted. Then we estimate the PDF and
confusion limits based on the realistic number count model for infrared
galaxies. The gradual flattening of the slope of the source counts makes the
clustering effect rather mild. Clustering effects result in an increase of the
limiting flux density with \sim 10%. In this case, the peak probability of the
PDF decreases up to \sim 15% and its tail becomes heavier.

  The galaxies were selected by color and morphology, and have generally red

directly measured mass-to-light ratios correlate well, demonstrating that the
spread in mass-to-light ratios is real and reflects variations in stellar
populations.
  The most massive galaxies have mass-to-light ratios comparable to massive
cluster galaxies at similar redshift, and therefore have stellar populations
which formed at high redshift (z>2). The lower mass galaxies at z~1 have a
lower average mass-to-light ratio, and one is a genuine 'E+A' galaxy. The
mass-to-light ratios indicate that their luminosity weighted ages are a factor
of three younger at the epoch of observation, due to either a late formation
redshift, or due to late bursts of star formation contributing 20-30% of the

modeling of their dust continuum emission. Single-dish line observations of 24
transitions of 9 molecular species (not counting isotopes) including HCO+,
N2H+, CS, SO, SO2, HCN, HNC, HC3N and CN are reported. The line intensities are
used to constrain the molecular abundances by comparison to Monte Carlo
radiative transfer modeling of the line strengths. An empirical chemical
network is constructed on the basis of correlations between the abundances of
various species. For example, it is seen that the HCO+ and CO abundances are
linearly correlated, both increasing with decreasing envelope mass. Species
such as CS, SO and HCN show no trend with envelope mass. In particular no trend
is seen between ``evolutionary stage'' of the objects and the abundances of the
main sulfur- or nitrogen-containing species. Among the nitrogen-bearing species
abundances of CN, HNC and HC3N are found to be closely correlated, which can be
understood from considerations of the chemical network. The CS/SO abundance
ratio is found to correlate with the abundances of CN and HC3N, which may
reflect a dependence on the atomic carbon abundance. An anti-correlation is
found between the deuteration of HCO+ and HCN, reflecting different temperature
dependences for gas-phase deuteration mechanisms. The abundances are compared
to other protostellar environments. In particular it is found that the
abundances in the cold outer envelope of the previously studied class 0
protostar IRAS16293-2422 are in good agreement with the average abundances for

undergoing simple passive evolution, but there is a systematic difference by a
factor ~2 in the host luminosity between RLQs and RQQs (M_K(RLQ) = -27.55 +-
0.12 and M_K(RQQ) = -26.83 +- 0.25). Comparison with quasar hosts at similar
and lower redshift indicates that the difference in the host luminosity between
RLQs and RQQs remains the same from z = 2 to the present epoch. No significant
correlation is found between the nuclear and the host luminosities. Assuming
that the host luminosity is proportional to the black hole mass, as observed in
nearby massive spheroids, these quasars emit at very different levels (spread

structures from a comparison of our images with observations secured at
close-by epochs by Donati et al. (2003) at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We
conclude that the small-scale brightness and magnetic patterns undergo major
changes within a timescale of 4 to 6 weeks, while the largest structures remain
stable over several years. We report the detection of a weak surface
differential rotation (both from brightness and magnetic tracers) indicating
that the equator rotates faster than the pole with a difference in rotation
rate between the pole and the equator about 4 times smaller than that of the
Sun. This result suggests that tidal forces also impact the global dynamic
equilibrium of convective zones in cool active stars.

sample of 28 X-ray galaxy clusters observed with Chandra at redshift between
0.4 and 1.3. In particular, we have twelve objects in the redshift range
0.4-0.6, five between 0.6 and 0.8, seven between 0.8 and 1 and four at z>1,
compounding the largest sample available for such a study. We focus
particularly on the properties and evolution of the X-ray scaling laws. We fit
both a single and a double beta-model with the former which provides a good
representation of the observed surface brightness profiles, indicating that
these clusters do not show any significant excess in their central brightness.
By using the best-fit parameters of the beta-model together with the measured
emission-weighted temperature (in the range 3-11 keV), we recover gas
luminosity, gas mass and total gravitating mass out to R500. We observe scaling
relations steeper than expected from self-similar model by a significant (>3
sigma) amount in the L-T and Mgas-T relations. We detect hints of negative
evolution in the L-T, Mgas-T and L-Mtot relations, thus suggesting that systems
at higher redshift have lower X-ray luminosity and gas mass for fixed
temperature. In particular, when the 16 clusters at z>0.6 are considered, the
evolution becomes more evident and its power-law modelization is a
statistically good description of the data.

oxygen dopings (x \lesssim 0.9) to more coherent anisotropic three-dimensional
behavior in the overdoped (x \approx 0.99) material at temperatures close to

c-axis value for \sigma_{dc} just above T_c; \rho_{s,c} \propto \sigma_{dc}
T_c. This scaling relation is observed along the c axis for all oxygen dopings,

liquid, connected to metallic leads and coupled to a gate is studied
theoretically. We find that the behavior of the charge as the gate voltage V_G
varies depends strongly on experimentally adjustable parameters (length,
contact transmission, temperature,...). When the intrinsic backscattering at
the contacts is weak (i.e. the conductance is close to 2e^2/h at high
temperature), we predict that this behavior should be described by a universal
function. For short such wires, the charge increases roughly linearly with V_G,
with small oscillations due to quantum interference between electrons scattered
at the contacts. For longer wires at low temperature, Coulomb blockade behavior
sets in, and the charge increases in steps. In both limits $\partial Q/\partial
V_G$, which should characterize the linear response conductance, exhibits
periodic peaks in V_G. We show that due to Coulomb interactions the period in
the former limit is twice that of the latter, and describe the evolution of the
peaks through this crossover. The study can be generalized to multi-channel
Luttinger liquids, and may explain qualitatively the recent observation by
Liang et al (Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 126801) of a four-electron periodicity for

fundamentally different from faceted browsing and site-specific search tools.
We built a user interface (Extempore) which accepts out-of-turn input via voice
or text; and employed it in a US congressional website, to determine if users
utilize out-of-turn interaction for information-finding tasks, and their
rationale for doing so. The results indicate that users are adept at discerning
when out-of-turn interaction is necessary in a particular task, and actively
interleaved it with browsing. However, users found cascading information across
information-finding subtasks challenging. Therefore, this work not only
improves our understanding of out-of-turn interaction, but also suggests
further opportunities to enrich browsing experiences for users.

co-workers with earlier quantum cosmological schemes. Because the weak-energy
condition can now be violated at short distances, and not necessarily with a
high energy density, a number of possible instabilities are suggested: flat
space unstable to expansion or baby universe production. Or else a Machian type
principle is required to prevent such behaviour. Allowing a bounce to prevent
an approaching singularity seems incompatible with other standard notions
concerning the arrow of time and unitarity.
  Preventing rapid oscillations in the wavefunction appears in conflict with
more general scalar-tensor gravity.
  Other approaches such as ``creation from nothing'' or from some quiescent

of the weak equivalence principle for torsion-balance experiments which are

the model non-viable. The method presented can be applied to generic theories

equivalence between this geometry and the Riemannian geometry of VTM, the
vertical bundle over the tangent bundle of M, treating TM as the base space. We
argue that this approach is unsatisfactory when there is an indefinite metric
on M because the corresponding Finsler fundamental function would not be
differentiable over TM (even without its zero section) and therefore TM cannot
serve as the base space. We then make the simple observation that for any
differentiable Lorentzian metric on a smooth space-time, the corresponding
Finsler fundamental function is differentiable exactly on a proper subbundle of
TM. This subbundle is then used, in place of TM, to provide a satisfactory
basis for modern Finsler geometry of manifolds with Lorentzian metrics.
Interestingly, this Finslerian property of Lorentzian metrics does not seem to
exist for general indefinite Finsler metrics and thus, Lorentzian metrics
appear to be of special relevance to Finsler geometry. We note that, in
contrast to the traditional formulation of Finsler geometry, having a
Lorentzian metric in the modern setting does not imply reduction to pseudo-
Riemannian geometry because metric and connection are entirely disentangled in
the modern formulation and there is a new indispensable non-linear connection,
necessary for construction of Finsler tensor bundles. It is concluded that
general relativity--without any modification--has a close bearing on Finsler
geometry and a modern Finsler formulation of the theory is an appealing idea...

show that nonlinear completions of the PF Lagrangian give rise to instability

Although these models are known to have ghosts in the linearized

which the ghosts are eliminated. In the latter case, however, the graviton
perturbations on the new background are not massive. We argue that a consistent

skew-symmetric, respectively. In special cases these numbers can be reduced to
the minima 12 or 10. If these minima occur then U admits an index commutation
symmetry. Furthermore minimal lengths are possible if U is formed from
torsion-free covariant derivatives of symmetric or alternating 2-tensor fields.

evaluated in the strong-field approximation. We employ a uniform approximation,
which is a generalization of the standard saddle-point approximation. We
systematically analyze the manifestations of the electron-electron interaction
in the momentum distributions of the ejected electrons: for the interaction, by
which the returning electron frees the bound electron, we adopt either a
(three-body) contact interaction or a Coulomb interaction, and we do or do not
incorporate the mutual Coulomb repulsion of the two electrons in their final
state. In particular, we investigate the correlation of the momentum components
parallel to the laser-field polarization, with the transverse momentum
components either restricted to certain finite ranges or entirely summed over.
In the latter case, agreement with experimental data is best for the contact
interaction and without final-state repulsion. In the former, if the transverse
momenta are restricted to small values, comparison of theory with the data
shows evidence of Coulomb effects. We propose that experimental data selecting
events with small transverse momenta of \textit{both} electrons are
particularly promising in the elucidation of the dynamics of NSDI. Also, a
classical approximation of the quantum-mechanical $S$ matrix is formulated and

counterclockwise (CCW) the flagella coalesce into a propulsive bundle,
producing a relatively straight ``run'', and when rotated clockwise (CW) they
fly apart, resulting in a ``tumble'' which reorients the cell with little
translocation. A stochastic process generates the runs and tumbles, and in a

yield a manifestly covariant expression for the most general positive-definite

Klein-Gordon equation. Employing a recently developed method of constructing
the Hilbert space and observables for Klein-Gordon fields, we then obtain the
probability current density ${\cal J}_a^\mu$ for the localization of a
Klein-Gordon field in space. We show that in the nonrelativistic limit both
$J_a^\mu$ and ${\cal J}_a^\mu$ tend to the probability current density for the
localization of a nonrelativistic free particle in space, but that unlike
$J_a^\mu$ the current density ${\cal J}_a^\mu$ is neither covariant nor
conserved. Because the total probability may be obtained by integrating either
of these two current densities over the whole space, the conservation of the
total probability may be viewed as a consequence of the local conservation of
$J_a^\mu$. The latter is a manifestation of a previously unnoticed global gauge
symmetry of the Klein-Gordon fields. The corresponding gauge group is U(1) if
the parameter $a$ is rational. It is the multiplicative group of positive real
numbers if $a$ is irrational. We also discuss an extension of our results to
Klein-Gordon fields minimally coupled to an electromagnetic field.

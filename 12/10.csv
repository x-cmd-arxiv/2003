Gemini South 8m telescope, we have detected and resolved 10 micron emission at
the position of the inner equatorial ring (ER) of supernova SN 1987A at day
6067. ``Hot spots'' similar to those found in the optical and near-IR are
clearly present. The morphology of the 10 micron emission is globally similar
to the morphology at other wavelengths from X-rays to radio. The observed
mid-IR flux in the region of SN1987A is probably dominated by emission from
dust in the ER. We have also detected the ER at 20 micron at a 4 sigma level.
Assuming that thermal dust radiation is the origin of the mid-IR emission, we
derive a dust temperature of 180^{+20}_{-10} K, and a dust mass of 1.- 8.
10^{-5} Mo for the ER. Our observations also show a weak detection of the
central ejecta at 10 micron. We show that previous bolometric flux estimates
(through day 2100) were not significantly contaminated by this newly discovered
emission from the ER. If we assume that the energy input comes from radioactive
decays only, our measurements together with the current theoretical models set
a temperature of 90 leq T leq 100 K and a mass range of 10^{-4} - 2. 10^{-3} Mo
for the dust in the ejecta. With such dust temperatures the estimated thermal
emission is 9(+/-3) 10^{35} erg s^{-1} from the inner ring, and 1.5 (+/-0.5)
10^{36} erg s^{-1} from the ejecta. Finally, using SN 1987A as a template, we
discuss the possible role of supernovae as major sources of dust in the
Universe.

substantial dynamical variation of the differential rotation within the solar
convection zone. Given the inevitable difficulties in resolving the precise
nature of variations at deeper layers, much effort has recently gone into
determining theoretically the expected modes of behaviour, using nonlinear
dynamo models. Two important limitations of these models are that they have so
far included only one form of nonlinearity, and as yet they have not taken into
account the density stratification in the solar convection zone. Here we
address both of these issues by studying the effects of including density
stratification, as well as including an alpha--quenching nonlinearity in
addition to the previously studied effects of the Lorentz force on the
differential rotation. We find that observationally important features found in
the earlier uniform density models remain qualitatively unchanged, although
there are quantitative differences. This is important as it provides more
realistic theoretical predictions to be compared with and guide observations,
especially in the deeper regions where the uncertainties in the inversions are
larger. However the presence of an effective alpha-quenching nonlinearity
significantly reduces the amplitudes of the oscillations.

respectively. Both components of V618 Per rotate at 10+/-5 km/s. The equatorial
rotational velocities for synchronous rotation are about 10 km/s for all four
stars. The timescales for orbital circularisation for both systems, and the
timescale for rotational synchronisation of V615 Per, are much greater than the
age of h Per. Their negligible eccentricities and equatorial rotational
velocities therefore support the hypothesis that they were formed by 'delayed
breakup'. We have compared the radii of these stars to models by the Granada

We conclude that the metallicity of the stars is about Z=0.01. This appears to
be the first estimate of the bulk metallicity of h Per. Recent photometric

central cluster galaxies. Their defining characteristic when imaged sensitively
at high resolution is their twin, well-collimated jets, which can persist with
low opening angle for tens of kpc before flaring into long, often bent plumes.
Although several models for the jet termination have been proposed, the
majority of them are unsatisfactory when confronted with observations. Here we
present the results of a programme of radio observations made with the aims of
showing that objects classified as WATs do all have well-collimated jets and
seeing in detail how the jets disrupt as they enter the plumes. We show that
compact, `hotspot-like' features at the ends of the jets are common but by no
means universal, and discuss the constraints that this places on models of the
jet-plume transition. We discuss the properties of the observed well-collimated
jets and, using relativistic beaming models, estimate their speed to be ~ 0.3c.
Finally, we show that the distance from the galactic centre at which the base
of the plume is found is related to the temperature of the host cluster.

galaxies and 14 S0 (or later) galaxies. These galaxies were observed using a
variety of different observing modes, each of which requires different and
often rather elaborate photometric reduction procedures. The ISO background
data agrees well with COBE-DIRBE results to which we have renormalized our
calibrations. As a further check, the ISO fluxes from galaxies at 60 and 100
microns agree very well with those previously observed with IRAS at these
wavelengths. The spatial resolution of ISO is several times greater than that
of IRAS and the ISO observations extend out to 200 microns which views a
significantly greater mass of colder dust not assessable to IRAS. Most of the
galaxies are essentially point sources at ISO resolution, but a few are clearly
extended at FIR wavelengths with image sizes that increase with FIR wavelength.
The integrated far infrared luminosities do not correlate with optical
luminosities, suggesting that the dust may have an external, merger-related
origin. In general the far infrared spectral energy distributions can be
modeled with dust at two temperatures, ~ 43 K and ~ 20 K, which probably
represent limits of a continuous range of temperatures. The colder dust
component dominates the total mass of dust, which is typically more than ten
times larger than the dust masses previously estimated for the same galaxies
using IRAS observations. For S0 galaxies we find that the optically normalized
far-infrared luminosity $L_{FIR} / L_B$ correlates strongly with the
mid-infrared luminosity $L_{15\mu\rm{m}} / L_B$, but that correlation is weaker

use the realistic physical model of Popescu et al. (2000) to describe the
overall ultra-violet (UV), optical and FIR spectral energy distribution (SED)
of a spiral galaxy. The model has only three free parameters: SFR, dust mass,
and the fraction of the UV radiation which is absorbed locally by dense dust in
the HII regions. Using this model, we are able to fit well the FIR spectra of
62 bright, IRAS galaxies from the ""SCUBA Local Universe Galaxy Survey"" of Dunne
et al.(2000). As a result, we are able to determine, among others, their SFR
and dust mass. We find that, on average, the SFR (in absolute units), the
star-formation efficiency, the SFR surface density, and the ratio of FIR
luminosity over the total intrinsic luminosity, are larger than the respective
values of typical spiral galaxies of the same morphological type. We also find
that the mean gas-to-dust mass ratio is close to the Galactic value, while the
average central face-on optical depth of these galaxies in the V band is 2.3.
Finally, we find a strong correlation between SFR or dust mass and observed FIR
quantities like total FIR luminosity or FIR luminosity at 100 and 850
$\mathrm{\mu m}$. These correlations yield well defined relations, which can be
used to determine a spiral galaxy's SFR and dust-mass content from FIR
observations.

luminous than the one found in hard state; b) a non-thermal component which is
compatible with either a power-law or a comptonization spectrum. The soft
component is equally well described by pure blackbody or multi-color disk
emission, with significantly higher temperature than observed in low state
(~1.3 vs. the ~0.5 keV assuming pure blackbody). For this model, the flux of
the non-thermal component below ~10 keV is a significant fraction of the total

of the BL Lac object Mkn 421. The data from LECS, MECS and PDS, covering an
energy interval from 0.1 to over 100 keV, have been used to study the spectral
variability of this source. We show that the energy distributions in different
luminosity states can be fitted very well by a log-parabolic law
F(E)=K*(E/E_1)^(-(a+b*Log(E/E_1))), which provides good estimates of the energy
and flux of the synchrotron peak in the SED. In the first four short
observations of 1997 Mkn 421 was characterized by a very stable spectral shape,
with average values a=2.25 and b=0.45. In the observations of 1998 smaller
values for both parameters, a~2.07 and b~0.34, were found and the peak energy
in the SED was in the range 0.5-0.8 keV. Also in the observations of May 1999
and April-May 2000 the log-parabolic model gave a satisfactory description of
the overall SED of Mkn 421. In particular, in the observations of spring 2000
the source was brighter than the other observations and showed a large change
of the spectral curvature. Spectral parameters estimates gave a~1.8 and b~0.19
and the energy of the maximum in the SED moved to the range 1-5.5 keV. We give
a possible interpretation of the log-parabolic spectral model in terms of
particle acceleration mechanisms. An energy distribution of emitting particles
with curvature close to the one observed can be explained by a simple model for
statistical acceleration with the assumption that the probability for a
particle to increase its energy is a decreasing function of the energy itself.
A consequence of this mechanism is the existence of a linear relation between
the spectral parameters a and b, well confirmed by the estimated values of
these two parameters for Mkn421.(Abridged)

improved in order to be useful and stable even for high dynamic range systems
with nearly degenerated lens model parameters. Our test case B0218+357 is
dominated by two bright images but the information needed to constrain the
unknown parameters is provided only by the relatively smooth and weak Einstein
ring. The new variant of LensClean is able to fit lens models even in this

LensClean, we develop the new method LenTil which inverts the lens equation
much more reliably than any other method. This high reliability is essential
for the use as part of LensClean. Finally a new method is developed to produce
source plane maps of the unlensed source from the best LensClean brightness
models. This method is based on the new concept of dirty beams in the source
plane.

plus an Einstein ring, it provides better constraints for the mass model than
other systems. The main problem left until now was the poorly determined
position of the lensing galaxy.
  After presenting results from classical lens modelling, we apply our improved
version of LensClean which utilizes the Einstein ring for lens modelling
purposes. The primary result using isothermal models is a well defined lens
position which allows the first reliable measurement of the Hubble constant
from this system. The result of H0=(78+-6) km/s/Mpc (2 sigma) is high compared
with other lenses but compatible with the HST key project and WMAP results. We
furthermore discuss effects of different radial mass profiles. The power-law
exponent of the potential is constrained by VLBI data to be beta=1.04+-0.02,
very close to isothermal. The effect on H0 is expected to be very small.
  We also present a composite map (lensed and unlensed) which shows the rich
structure of B0218+357 on scales from milli-arcseconds to arcseconds. Finally
we use a comparison of observations at different frequencies to investigate the
question of possible weakening of one of the images by propagation effects
and/or source shifts with frequency. The data clearly favour the model of
significant extinction without noticeable source position shifts.

asymmetries grow during the collapse, causing the resultant supernova to also
be asymmetric. As the ejecta is launched, it pushes off (or ``kicks'') the
newly formed neutron star. This paper presents the first 3-dimensional
supernova simulations of this process. The ejecta is not the only matter that
kicks the newly-formed neutron star. Neutrinos also carry away momentum and the
asymmetric collapse leads also to asymmetries in the neutrinos. However, the
neutrino asymmetries tend to damp out the neutron star motions and even the
most extreme asymmetric collapses presented here do not produce final neutron
star velocities above 200km/s.

large optical luminosities (log LB=10.35-10.67 solar) but have X-ray
luminosities consistent with emission from discrete sources only. In
conjunction with a Chandra observation of NGC 3585, we analyse the XMM data and
show that the three galaxies are dominated by discrete source emission, but do
possess some X-ray emitting gas. The gas is at relatively low temperatures,
kT=0.25-0.44 keV. All three galaxies show evidence of recent dynamical
disturbance and formation through mergers, including kinematically distinct
cores, young stellar ages, and embedded stellar disks. This leads us to
conclude that the galaxies formed relatively recently and have yet to build up
large X-ray halos. They are likely to be in a developmental phase where the
X-ray gas has a very low density, making it undetectable outside the galaxy
core. However, if the gas is a product of stellar mass loss, as seems most
probable, we would expect to observe supersolar metal abundances. While
abundance is not well constrained by the data, we find best fit abundances <0.1
solar for single-temperature models, and it seems unlikely that we could
underestimate the metallicity by such a large factor.

the first law of thermodynamics $dE = T dS - Q d\gamma$ relating infinitesimal
changes in energy $E$, entropy $S$ and shear rate $\gamma$ with kinetic

Helfand's moment for viscosity. This approach leads to thermodynamic stability

that the amount of heat based on this entropy is equal to the average of

SPCE is closest at higher temperatures. A rescaling procedure inspired by
information theory model of Hummer et al. ({\em Chem.Phys.}258, 349-370 (2000))

by far the strongest temperature dependence.The suggested density-rescaling is
also applied to the Xenon-Xenon contact-pair configuration, indicating the

is close to the energy of a bound state, i.e., a molecular state, in a closed
channel that is coupled to the incoming open channel. Due to the different spin
arrangements of the atoms in the open channel and the atoms in the molecular
state, the energy difference between the bound state and the two-atom continuum
threshold is experimentally accessible by means of the Zeeman interaction of
the atomic spins with a magnetic field. As a result, it is in principle
possible to vary the scattering length to any value by tuning the magnetic
field. This level of experimental control has opened the road for many
beautiful experiments, which recently led to the demonstration of coherence
between atoms and molecules. This is achieved by observing coherent
oscillations between atoms and molecules, analogous to coherent Rabi
oscillations that occur in ordinary two-level systems. We review the many-body
theory that describes coherence between atoms and molecules in terms of an
effective quantum field theory for Feshbach-resonant interactions. The most

each mode with a given wave vector is correlated to that of its partner mode

imprint on temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. Their
spatial properties are best revealed by using local wave packets. This analysis
shows that all density fluctuations giving rise the large scale structures
originate in pairs which are born near the reheating. In fact each local
density fluctuation is paired with an oppositely moving partner with opposite
amplitude. To obtain these results we first apply a ``wave packet
transformation'' with respect to one argument of the two point correlation
function. A finer understanding of the correlations is then reached by making
use of coherent states. The knowledge of the velocity field is required to
extract the contribution of a single pair of wave packets. Otherwise, there is
a two-folded degeneracy which gives three aligned wave packets arising from two
pairs. The applicability of these methods to observational data is briefly
discussed.

one of the d extra spatial dimensions could be very large relative to the
Planck scale, which lowers the fundamental gravity scale, possibly even down to
the electroweak (~ TeV) level. This revolutionary picture arises in the
framework of recent developments in M theory. The 1+10-dimensional M theory
encompasses the known 1+9-dimensional superstring theories, and is widely
considered to be a promising potential route to quantum gravity. General
relativity cannot describe gravity at high enough energies and must be replaced
by a quantum gravity theory, picking up significant corrections as the
fundamental energy scale is approached. At low energies, gravity is localized
at the brane and general relativity is recovered, but at high energies gravity
""leaks"" into the bulk, behaving in a truly 1+3+d-dimensional way. This
introduces significant changes to gravitational dynamics and perturbations,
with interesting testable implications for high-energy astrophysics, black
holes and cosmology. Brane-world models offer a phenomenological way to test
some of the novel predictions and corrections to general relativity that are
implied by M theory. This review discusses the geometry, dynamics and
perturbations of simple brane-world models for cosmology and astrophysics,
mainly focusing on warped 5-dimensional brane-worlds based on the

of freedom in such an interacting system. This fact related with fundamental
properties of General Relativity (discussed already at 1916) can be treated as
a peculiarity of the spacetime Higgs effect which occurs in General Relativity

partially ordered set (I,<), an (I,<)-configuration (\sigma,\iota,\pi) is a
finite collection of objects \sigma(J) and morphisms \iota(J,K) or \pi(J,K) :
\sigma(J) --> \sigma(K) satisfying some axioms, where J,K are subsets of I.
Configurations describe how an object X in A decomposes into subobjects, and
are especially useful for studying stability conditions on A.
  This paper defines and motivates the idea of configurations, and explains
some natural operations upon them -- subconfigurations, quotient
configurations, refinements, improvements and substitution. Then we study
moduli spaces of (I,<)-configurations in A, using the theory of Artin stacks.
We prove well-behaved moduli stacks exist when A is an abelian category of
coherent sheaves or vector bundles on a projective K-scheme P, or of
representations of a quiver Q. We define many natural 1-morphisms between the
moduli stacks, some of which are representable or of finite type.
  The sequels will apply these results to construct and study
infinite-dimensional algebras associated to a quiver Q, and to define systems
of invariants of a projective K-scheme P that ""count"" (semi)stable coherent
sheaves and satisfy interesting identities.

  triggering of secondary flows","18 pages manuscript, 10 figures, to be published in Journal of Fluid
  Mechanics (2005)",,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.geo-ph",,"  Viscous heating can play an important role in the dynamics of fluids with
strongly temperature-dependent viscosities because of the coupling between the
energy and momentum equations. The heat generated by viscous friction produces
a local temperature increase near the tube walls with a consequent decrease of
the viscosity and a strong stratification in the viscosity profile. The problem
of viscous heating in fluids was investigated and reviewed by Costa & Macedonio
(2003) because of its important implications in the study of magma flows.
Because of the strong coupling between viscosity and temperature, the
temperature rise due to the viscous heating may trigger instabilities in the
velocity field, which cannot be predicted by a simple isothermal Newtonian
model. When viscous heating produces a pronounced peak in the temperature
profile near the walls, a triggering of instabilities and a transition to
secondary flows can occur because of the stratification in the viscosity
profile. In this paper we focus on the thermal and mechanical effects caused by
viscous heating. We will present the linear stability equations and we will
show, as in certain regimes, these effects can trigger and sustain a particular
class of secondary rotational flows which appear organised in coherent
structures similar to roller vortices. This phenomenon can play a very
important role in the dynamics of magma flows in conduits and lava flows in
channels and, to our knowledge, it is the first time that it has been
investigated by a direct numerical simulation.

time-scale separation is analyzed. It is found that small random perturbations
of the fast excitatory variable result in the onset of a quasi-deterministic
limit cycle behavior, absent without noise. The limit cycle is established at a
critical value of the amplitude of the noise, and its period is nontrivially
determined by the relationship between the noise amplitude and the time scale
ratio. It is argued that this effect might provide a mechanism by which the
function of biological systems operating in noisy environments can be robustly
controlled by the level of the noise.

  in Phys. Rev. E; New figure added",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.69.051913",,"q-bio.PE",,"  The evolutionary persistence of symbiotic associations is a puzzle.
Adaptation should eliminate cooperative traits if it is possible to enjoy the
advantages of cooperation without reciprocating - a facet of cooperation known
in game theory as the Prisoner's Dilemma. Despite this barrier, symbioses are
widespread, and may have been necessary for the evolution of complex life. The
discovery of strategies such as tit-for-tat has been presented as a general
solution to the problem of cooperation. However, this only holds for
within-species cooperation, where a single strategy will come to dominate the
population. In a symbiotic association each species may have a different
strategy, and the theoretical analysis of the single species problem is no
guide to the outcome. We present basic analysis of two-species cooperation and
show that a species with a fast adaptation rate is enslaved by a slowly
evolving one. Paradoxically, the rapidly evolving species becomes highly
cooperative, whereas the slowly evolving one gives little in return. This helps
understand the occurrence of endosymbioses where the host benefits, but the
symbionts appear to gain little from the association.

does not follow a simple power-law as a function of the separation between the

enhanced by several orders of magnitude as the sphere approaches the substrate,

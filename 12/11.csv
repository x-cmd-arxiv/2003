Time-dependent hydrodynamic loop modeling is used to describe the rise and peak
of the light curve, and a large fraction of the decay, including its change of
slope and a secondary maximum, over a duration of more than 2 hours. The light
curve, the emission measure and the temperature derived from the data allow us
to constrain the loop morphology and the heating function and to show that this
flare can be described with two components: a major one triggered by an intense
heat pulse injected in a single flaring loop with half-length ~1.0 10^{10} cm,
the other one by less intense heat pulses released after about 1/2 hour since
the first one in related loop systems, probably arcades, with the same
half-length. The heat functions of the two loop systems appear be very similar:
an intense pulse located at the loop footpoints followed by a low gradual decay
distributed in corona. The latter result and the similarity to at least one
solar event (the Bastille Day flare in 2000) indicate that this pattern may be
common to solar and stellar flares, in wide generality.

sub-cluster is identified as a smaller cluster which has just undergone initial
in-fall and pass-through of the primary cluster, and has been previously
identified in both optical surveys and X-ray studies. The X-ray gas has been
separated from the galaxies by ram-pressure stripping during the pass-through.
The detected mass peak is located between the X-ray peak and galaxy
concentration, although the position is consistent with the galaxy centroid
within the errors of the mass reconstruction. We find that the mass peak for
the main cluster is in good spatial agreement with the cluster galaxies and
offset from the X-ray halo at 3.4 sigma significance, and determine that the
mass-to-light ratios of the two components are consistent with those of relaxed
clusters. The observed offsets of the lensing mass peaks from the peaks of the
dominant visible mass component (the X-ray gas) directly demonstrate the
presence, and dominance, of dark matter in this cluster. This proof of the dark
matter existence holds true even under the assumption of modified Newtonian
gravity (MOND); from the observed gravitational shear to optical light ratios
and mass peak - X-ray gas offsets, the dark matter component in a MOND regime
has a total mass which is at least equal to the baryonic mass of the system.

(SED) of spherical circumstellar envelopes. Based on the self-similarity
relations of dusty SEDs derived by Ivezic & Elitzur (1997), we expect an
approximate invariance of the IR SED for models with different grain sizes.
Approximate invariance follows from the fact that differently sized grains have
similar optical properties at long wavelengths where the dust reprocesses the
starlight. In this paper, we discuss what are the physical requirements on the
model parameters to maintain the approximate invariance of the IR SED. Single
grain size models are studied for a wide range of grain sizes in three optical
depth regimes. In this study, we find limits for the cases where the IR SED is
and is not capable of conveying information about grain sizes, and to what
extent it does so. We find that approximate invariance occurs for a much larger
range of grain sizes than previously believed, and, when approximate invariance
holds, the SED is controlled mainly by one parameter, the reprocessing optical
depth, a quantity that measures the fraction of starlight that is absorbed by
the dust grains. Models with a grain size distribution are studied as well. For
these models, we find that, in many instances, the concept of approximate
invariance may be extended from the IR SED to all wavelengths. This means that,
for a wide range of optical depths, models with different grain size
distributions will produce very similar SEDs and, hence, the reprocessing
optical depth is the only quantity that can be unambiguously obtained from the
SED. The observational consequences of this result are discussed in detail.

non-gravitational processes involved in structure formation and evolution will
alter such a correlation. In this paper we explore how scatter in the
temperature-density relation of the IGM reduces the gravitationally induced
scale-scale correlation. By examining whether or not observations of the
correlation are close to that predicted by pure gravity, this puts constraints
on the scatter in the temperature-density relation and in turn on any physical
process which would lead to scatter, e.g. strong fluctuations in the UV
background or radiative transfer effects. By applying this method to high
resolution Keck spectra of Q 1422+231 and HS 1946+7658, we find the predicted
correlation signal induced by gravity, and the diminishing of this correlation
signal at small scales. This suggests extra physics affects the small-scale

suggests, if there is any spatial correlation of temperature, the coherence

measures the slope and curvature of each object's UV/optical spectrum. The
slope vs. curvature distribution is elongated along the axis predicted for

a spurious ellipticity into galaxy shapes during the readout process. We
correct for this effect as a function of signal to noise and CCD position. We
further show that the detected cosmic shear signal is nearly constant in time

Ori 70) is a spectroscopically verified low mass (3$^{+5}_{-1}$ M$_{Jup}$)
member of the 1--8 Myr $\sigma$ Orionis cluster. Comparative arguments by
Mart{\'{i}}n & Zapatero Osorio asserting that S Ori 70 exhibits low surface
gravity spectral features indicative of youth and low mass are invalidated by
the fact that their comparison object was not the field T dwarf 2MASS
0559$-$1404 but rather a nearby background star. Instead, we find that the
1--2.5 $\micron$ spectra of S Ori 70 are well-matched to older (age $\sim$ few
Gyr) field T6--T7 dwarfs. Moreover, we find that spectral model fits to
late-type field T dwarf spectra tend to yield low surface gravities ($\log{g}$
= 3.0--3.5), and thus young ages ($\lesssim$ 5 Myr) and low masses ($\lesssim$
3 M$_{Jup}$), inconsistent with expected and/or empirical values. Finally, we
show that the identification of one T dwarf in the field imaged by Zapatero
Osorio et al. is statistically consistent with the expected foreground
contamination. Based on the re-examined evidence, we conclude that S Ori 70 may
simply be an old, massive (30--60 M$_{Jup}$) field brown dwarf lying in the
foreground of the $\sigma$ Orionis cluster. This interpretation should be
considered before presuming the existence of so-called ``cluster planets.''

short bursts, rather than to a (marginally) different peak energy. Moreover, we
find that short GRBs are similar to the first 1 sec emission of long bursts.
The comparison of the energetic of short and long bursts also suggests that
short GRBs do not obey the peak energy--equivalent isotropic energy correlation
recently proposed for long events, implying that short GRBs emit lower energy
than long ones. Nonetheless, short bursts seem to emit a luminosity similar to
long GRBs and under such hypothesis their redshift distribution appears
consistent with that observed for long events. These findings might suggest the
presence of a common mechanism at the beginning of short and long bursts which
operates on different timescales in the these two classes.

Proxima Centauri with the XMM-Newton satellite. We find strongly variable
coronal X-ray emission, with flares ranging over a factor of 100 in peak flux.
The low-level emission is found to be continuously variable. Several weak
flares are characteristically preceded by an optical burst, compatible with
predictions from standard solar flare models. We propose that the U band bursts
are proxies for the elusive stellar non-thermal hard X-ray bursts suggested
from solar observations. A very large X-ray flare was observed in its entirety,
with a peak luminosity of 3.9E28 erg/s [0.15-10 keV] and a total X-ray energy
of 1.5E32 erg. This flare has allowed to measure significant density variations
from X-ray spectroscopy of the OVII He-like triplet; we find peak densities
reaching up to 4E11 cm^-3 for plasma of about 1-5 MK. Abundance ratios show
little variability in time, with a tendency of elements with a high first
ionization potential to be overabundant relative to solar photospheric values.
We do not find significant effects due to opacity during the flare, indicating
that large opacity increases are not the rule even in extreme flares. We model
the large flare in terms of an analytic 2-Ribbon flare model and find that the
flaring loop system should have large characteristic sizes (~1R*). These
results are supported by full hydrodynamic simulations. Comparing the large
flare to flares of similar size occurring much more frequently on more active
stars, we propose that the X-ray properties of active stars are a consequence
of superimposed flares such as the example analyzed in this paper. Such a model
also explains why, during episodes of low-level emission, more active stars
show hotter plasma than less active stars.

plus a dominant power-law, on which complex soft absorption (possibly a blended

strong Fe Kalpha emission. The iron feature in the high-energy spectra appears
broad; however, on close examination of the EPIC pn data, there exists the
possibility that the broad emission feature can be attributed to a neutral Fe
Kalpha line in addition to a blend of He- and H-like Fe Kalpha lines. The light
curve shows a strong, hard X-ray flare concentrated in the 3-12 keV band. The
flare appears to induce spectral variability, showing spectral hardening to be
occuring as the flare intensifies. A detailed examination suggests that the
spectral variability is most likely due to an increase in the 3-12 keV flux
relative to the soft flux during the flare. A difference spectrum and complete
modelling of the flare and non-flare spectra show intrinsic changes only in the
normalisation of the continuum components and not in their shape parameters.
The timing results are consistent with the flare originating in the accretion
disc corona. The iron emission line(s) do not appear to respond to changes in
the continuum flux during the flare; the iron lines are stronger in equivalent
width during the low-flux (non-flare) states, and weaker during the flare.

detected also for COBE-DMR maps. If this effect is due to geodesic mixing, it
would indicate a non precisely zero curvature of the Universe which is among
the discussed reasons of the WMAP low multipole anomaly. Both effects are
related to the diameter of the Universe: the geodesics mixing through
hyperbolic geometry, low multipoles through boundary conditions.This common

the modes of vacuum fluctuations conditioned by the boundary conditions lead to
a value of the cosmological constant being in remarkable agreement with the

induced by the positional disorder and the E value by the orientational

their effects on the global E value. We find that the hydrogen bonding between
a Mn12 molecule and the solvent molecule is crucial to obtain a substantial E

corrected emission spectra, which also show a clear dependence of both peak
position and peak width upon excitation energy. Our findings indicate that
photoluminescence emission in eumelanins is derived from ensembles of small

exist in low dimensions at all temperatures for directed polymers and
interfaces in random media. For the uncorrelated Gaussian disorder, we obtain
that the optimal strategy for the polymer in dimension $1+d$ with $0<d<2$
involves at the same time (i) a confinement in a favorable tube of radius $R_S
\sim L^{\nu_S}$ with $\nu_S=1/(4-d)<1/2$ (ii) a superdiffusive behavior $R \sim
L^{\nu}$ with $\nu=(3-d)/(4-d)>1/2$ for the wandering of the best favorable
tube available. The corresponding free-energy then scales as $F \sim
L^{\omega}$ with $\omega=2 \nu-1$ and the left tail of the probability
distribution involves a stretched exponential of exponent $\eta= (4-d)/2$.
These results generalize the well known exact exponents $\nu=2/3$, $\omega=1/3$
and $\eta=3/2$ in $d=1$, where the subleading transverse length $R_S \sim
L^{1/3}$ is known as the typical distance between two replicas in the Bethe
Ansatz wave function. We then extend our approach to correlated disorder in
transverse directions with exponent $\alpha$ and/or to manifolds in dimension
$D+d=d_{t}$ with $0<D<2$. The strategy of being both confined and
superdiffusive is still optimal for decaying correlations ($\alpha<0$), whereas
it is not for growing correlations ($\alpha>0$). In particular, for an
interface of dimension $(d_t-1)$ in a space of total dimension $5/3<d_t<3$ with
random-bond disorder, our approach yields the confinement exponent $\nu_S =
(d_t-1)(3-d_t)/(5d_t-7)$. Finally, we study the exponents in the presence of an
algebraic tail $1/V^{1+\mu}$ in the disorder distribution, and obtain various
regimes in the $(\mu,d)$ plane.

by the in-plane resonant dissociation of the molecules into outgoing

``excitonic molecule $\to$ 0$\lambda$-mode polariton + 0$\lambda$-mode

spectroscopies, we infer that the radiative width, associated with excitonic
molecules of the binding energy $\epsilon_{\rm XX} \simeq 0.9-1.1$ meV, is
$\Gamma^{\rm MC}_{\rm XX} \simeq 0.2-0.3$ meV in the microcavities and
$\Gamma^{\rm QW}_{\rm XX} \simeq 0.1$ meV in a reference GaAs single quantum

nanostructures the $T_2 = 2 T_1$ limit, relevant to the XX states, holds at
temperatures below 10 K, and that the bipolariton model of excitonic molecules
explains quantitatively and self-consistently the measured XX radiative widths.
We also find and characterize two critical points in the dependence of the
radiative corrections against the microcavity detuning, and propose to use the
critical points for high-precision measurements of the molecule bindingenergy

infrared, which is compatible with all current experimental observations. This
is an analog of Higgs mechanism in general relativity, and can be thought of as
arising from ghost condensation--a background where a scalar field \phi has a
constant velocity, <\dot\phi> = M^2. The ghost condensate is a new kind of
fluid that can fill the universe, which has the same equation of state, \rho =
-p, as a cosmological constant, and can hence drive de Sitter expansion of the
universe. However, unlike a cosmological constant, it is a physical fluid with
a physical scalar excitation, which can be described by a systematic effective
field theory at low energies. The excitation has an unusual low-energy
dispersion relation \omega^2 \sim k^4 / M^2. If coupled to matter directly, it
gives rise to small Lorentz-violating effects and a new long-range 1/r^2 spin
dependent force. In the ghost condensate, the energy that gravitates is not the
same as the particle physics energy, leading to the possibility of both sources
that can gravitate and antigravitate. The Newtonian potential is modified with
an oscillatory behavior starting at the distance scale M_{Pl}/M^2 and the time
scale M_{Pl}^2/M^3. This theory opens up a number of new avenues for attacking
cosmological problems, including inflation, dark matter and dark energy.

Sitter phase is obtained with a ghost condensate. The transition to radiation
dominance is triggered by the ghost itself, without any slow-roll potential.
Density perturbations are generated by fluctuations around the ghost condensate
and can be reliably computed in the effective field theory. The fluctuations
are scale invariant as a consequence of the de Sitter symmetries, however, the
size of the perturbations are parametrically different from conventional
slow-roll inflation, and the inflation happens at far lower energy scales. The
model makes definite predictions that distinguish it from standard inflation,
and can be sharply excluded or confirmed by experiments in the near future. The
tilt in the scalar spectrum is predicted to vanish (n_s=1), and the gravity
wave signal is negligible. The non-Gaussianities in the spectrum are predicted
to be observable: the 3-point function is determined up to an overall order 1
constant, and its magnitude is much bigger than in conventional inflation, with
an equivalent f_NL ~ 100, not far from the present WMAP bounds.

  Noncommutative Geometry and Physics,p321-355,World Scientific",,,,"hep-th math-ph math.MP",,"  We study topological aspects of matrix models and noncommutative
cohomological field theories (N.C.CohFT). N.C.CohFT have symmetry under the
arbitrary infinitesimal noncommutative parameter $\theta$ deformation. This
fact implies that N.C.CohFT possess a less sensitive topological property than
K-theory, but the classification of manifolds by N.C.CohFT has a possibility to
give a new view point of global characterization of noncommutative manifolds.
To investigate properties of N.C.CohFT, we construct some models whose fixed
point loci are given by sets of projection operators. Particularly, the
partition function on the Moyal plane is calculated by using a matrix model.
The moduli space of the matrix model is a union of Grassman manifolds. The
partition function of the matrix model is calculated using the Euler number of
the Grassman manifold. Identifying the N.C.CohFT with the matrix model, we get
the partition function of the N.C.CohFT. To check the independence of the
noncommutative parameters, we also study the moduli space in the large $\theta$
limit and the finite $\theta$, for the Moyal plane case. If the partition
function of N.C.CohFT is topological in the sense of the noncommutative
geometry, then it should have some relation with K-theory. Therefore we
investigate certain models of CohFT and N.C.CohFT from the point of view of
K-theory. These observations give us an analogy between CohFT and N.C.CohFT in
connection with K-theory. Furthermore, we verify it for the Moyal plane and
noncommutative torus cases that our partition functions are invariant under the
those deformations which do not change the K-theory. Finally, we discuss the
noncommutative cohomological Yang-Mills theory.

due to the electric field is level dependent. In the opposite case, i.e., for
$\alpha = 0$, we recover the conventional quantum mechanical picture of an

in position, i.e., for $\beta \ne 0$. Then we consider the problem of a
$D$-dimensional harmonic oscillator in the case of isotropic nonzero minimal
uncertainties in the position coordinates, depending on two parameters $\beta$,
$\beta'$. We extend our methods to deal with the corresponding radial equation
in the momentum representation and rederive in a simple way both the spectrum

a complete asymptotic description of the individual eigenvalues in certain

$\epsilon$ is $\gg h^{1/2}$, or sometimes only $\gg h$, and enjoys the upper
bound $\epsilon={\cal O}(h^{\delta})$, for some $\delta>0$.

thresholds. Each MPEC has 32 x 32 pixels of 200 um x 200 um pixel size. For a
MCM the 4 chips are arranged in a 2 x 2 array which leads to a 64 x 64 sensor
pixel geometry. The MCM construction is described, and the imaging performance
of the different detectors is shown. As readout system a newly developed USB
system has been used.

least action principle in classical mechanics, in which the action is varied
under the constraint of fixed mean energy for the trial trajectory. The
original Maupertuis (Euler-Lagrange) principle constrains the energy at every
point along the trajectory. The generalized Maupertuis principle is equivalent
to Hamilton's principle. Reciprocal principles are also derived for both the
generalized Maupertuis and the Hamilton principles. The Reciprocal Maupertuis
Principle is the classical limit of Schr\""{o}dinger's variational principle of
wave mechanics, and is also very useful to solve practical problems in both
classical and semiclassical mechanics, in complete analogy with the quantum
Rayleigh-Ritz method. Classical, semiclassical and quantum variational
calculations are carried out for a number of systems, and the results are
compared. Pedagogical as well as research problems are used as examples, which
include nonconservative as well as relativistic systems.

FEL. These simulations are based on the programs Astra and elegant for the
generation and transport of the electron distribution. An independent
simulation of the intricate beam dynamics in the magnetic bunch compressor is
performed with the program CSRtrack. The SASE FEL process is simulated with the
code FAST. From our detailed simulations and the resulting phase space
distribution at the undulator entrance, we found that the FEL was driven only
by a small fraction (slice) of the electron bunch. This ""lasing slice"" is
located in the head of the bunch, and has a peak current of approximately 3 kA.
A strong energy chirp (due to the space charge field after compression) within
this slice had a significant influence on the FEL operation. Our study shows
that the radiation pulse duration is about 40 fs (FWHM) with a corresponding
peak power of 1.5 GW. The simulated FEL properties are compared with various
experimental data and found to be in excellent agreement.

mechanics, it is usually assumed that physical measurements concern observables
common to both theories . Not so with the eigenvalues ($\pm 1$) of the parity
operator. The effect of such a measurement on a mixture of even and odd states
of the harmonic oscillator is akin to separating at a single stroke a pair of
shuffled card decks: the result is a set of definite parity, though otherwise
mixed. The Wigner function should be a sensitive probe for this phenomenon, for
it can be interpreted as the expectation value of the parity operator. We here
derive the general form of Wigner functions $W_{\pm}$, resulting from an ideal
parity measurement on $W(\x)$. Even if $W(\x)$ resembles a classical
distribution, $W_{\pm}$ displays a quantum spike, which is positive for $W_+$
and negative for $W_-$. However we conjecture that $W_+$ always has negative
values.

coupling on disentanglement. An argument based on separability conditions for
gaussian states is used to arrive at a set of conditions on the couplings
sufficient for all initial states to disentangle for good after a finite time.

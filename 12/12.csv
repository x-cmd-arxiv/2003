strong candidates in the Hercules field. We conducted a blind test of our
ability to recover transiting systems by injecting signals into our data and
measuring the recovery rate as a function of transit depth and orbital period.
About 85% of transit signals with a depth of 0.02 mag were recovered. However,
only 50% of transit signals with a depth of 0.01 mag were recovered. We expect
that the number of stars for which we can search for transiting planets will
increase substantially for our current field in Andromeda, due to the lower

from T Tauri star LkH$\alpha$321, using the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging

in the case of RW Aur, ~ 50 AU for TH28, and 165 AU in the case of
LkH$\alpha$321. These velocity asymmetries are interpreted as rotation in the
initial portion of the jet where it is accelerated and collimated. For the
bi-polar jets, both lobes appear to rotate in the same direction. Values
obtained were in agreement with the predictions of MHD disk-wind models
(Bacciotti et al 2002, Anderson et al 2003, Dougados et al 2003, Pesenti et al

magneto-centrifugal launching (Anderson et al 2003).

that the use of Schwarzschild dynamical (orbit-based) models leads to an
indeterminacy regarding the estimation of the free parameters like the central
black hole mass and the stellar mass-to-light ratio of the galaxy under study.
We examine this issue with semi-analytic two-integral models, which are not
affected by the intrinsic degeneracy of three-integral systems. We however
confirm the Valluri et al. result, and observe the so-called widening of the
chi2 contours as the orbit library is expanded. We also show that, although
two-dimensional data coverage help in constraining the orbital structure of the
modelled galaxy, it does not in principle solve the indeterminacy issue, which
mostly originates from the discretization of such an inverse problem. We show
that adding regularization constraints stabilizes the confidence level contours
on which the estimation of black hole mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio are
based. We therefore propose to systematically use regularization as a tool to
prevent the solution to depend on the orbit library. Regularization, however,
introduces an unavoidable bias on the derived solutions. We hope that the
present Letter will trigger some more research directed at a better
understanding of the issues addressed here.

mildly supersonic, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. The focus is on the OH
masers for which the magnetic field is strong enough that the separations of
the Zeeman components are greater than the spectral linebreadths. A
longstanding puzzle has been the absence of the Zeeman $\pi $ components and
the high circular polarization in the observed spectra of these masers. We
first argue that the elongation of eddies along the field that has recently
been recognized in MHD turbulence will enhance the optical depth parallel to
the magnetic field in comparison with that perpendicular to the magnetic field.
We then simulate maser emission with a numerical model of MHD turbulence to
demonstrate quantitatively how the intensities of the linearly polarized $\pi $
components are suppressed and the intensities of the nearly circularly
polarized $\sigma $ components are enhanced. This effect is also generic in the
sense that most spectral lines in MHD turbulence with Mach number $M\sim 1$
should have larger optical depths parallel to the magnetic field than
perpendicular. The effect is reduced considerably when $M<1$. The simulations
also demonstrate that the velocity and magnetic field variations due to the
turbulence can (but do not necessarily) cause one of the $\sigma $ components
to be much more intense than the other, as is often observed for mainline OH
masers.

quadrupole. In actual fact, some models suppress the quadrupole while others
elevate it, according to whether their low-order modes are weak or strong
relative to their high-order modes. Elementary geometrical reasoning shows that
a model's largest dimension determines the rough value ell_min at which the CMB
power spectrum ell(ell + 1)C_ell/(2pi) effectively begins; for cosmologically
relevant models, ell_min < 4. More surprisingly, elementary geometrical
reasoning shows that further reduction of a model's smaller dimensions -- with
its largest dimension held fixed -- serves to elevate modes in the neighborhood
of ell_min relative to the high-ell portion of the spectrum, rather than
suppressing them as one might naively expect. Thus among the models whose
largest dimension is comparable to or less than the horizon diameter, the
low-order C_ell tend to be relatively weak in well-proportioned spaces (spaces
whose dimensions are approximately equal in all directions) but relatively
strong in oddly-proportioned spaces (spaces that are significantly longer in
some directions and shorter in others). We illustrate this principle in detail
for the special cases of rectangular 3-tori and spherical spaces. We conclude
that well-proportioned spaces make the best candidates for a topological
explanation of the low CMB quadrupole observed by COBE and WMAP.

differences in the carbon abundances of M13 subgiants, we present new Keck LRIS
spectra reaching more that 1.5 mag below the M13 main-sequence turn-off (to V ~
20). Our analysis reveals a distribution of C abundances similar to that found
among the subgiants, implying little change in the compositions of the M13
stars at least through the main-sequence turn-off. We presume these differences
to be the result of some process operating early in the cluster history.
  Additional spectra of previously studied bright M13 giants have been obtained
with the Hale 5-m. A comparison of C abundances derived using the present
methods and those from the literature yield a mean difference of 0.03+-0.14 dex
for four stars in common with Smith et al. (1996) and 0.14+-0.07 dex for stars
also observed by Suntzeff (1981) (if one extreme case is removed). We conclude
that the lower surface C abundances of these luminous giants as compared to the
subgiants and main-sequence stars are likely the result of mixing rather than a
difference in our abundance scales.
  NH band strengths have also been measured for a handful of the most luminous
M13 turn-off stars. While molecular band formation in such stars is weak,
significant star-to-star NH band strength differences are present. Moreover,
for the stars with both C and N measurements, differences between stars in
these two elements appear to be anticorrelated.
  Finally, the most recent C and N abundances for main-sequence, main-sequence
turn-off, and subgiant stars in 47 Tuc, M71, M5, and the present M13 data are
compared.

CN-strong stars exhibiting depleted carbon and enhanced nitrogen.
  2) The abundances of both elements agree remarkably well with those found
among the evolved red giants of the cluster implying little change in surface
abundances from at least Mv ~ +6.5 to the tip of the red giant branch.
  3) The pattern of C-depletions and N-enhancements are quite similar to those
seen among the turn-off stars of M71, a cluster of almost identical metallicity
but lower central concentration and escape velocity. At the same time, similar
if not smaller N-enhancements and larger C-depletions are evident among like
stars in the more metal-poor cluster M5.
  We interpret these results, as did Harbeck et al., as evidence of the
operation of some pollution/accretion event early in the cluster history - the
most likely source being AGB ejecta. However, the present results rule out
simple surface pollution and suggest that a substantial fraction of the present

of M31 which spans a large fraction of the M31 rotation velocity. This class of
features is confined to about 12 deg (160 kpc) projected radius of M31 and
appears to be physically associated. We detect a diffuse northern extension of
the Magellanic Stream (MS) from at least Dec=+20 to +40 deg., which then loops
back toward the south. Recent numerical simulations had predicted just such an
MS extension corresponding to the apo-galacticon portion of the LMC/SMC orbit

systemic velocities of M31 with that of M33 and continues beyond M31 to the

faint X-ray sources). Spectra and R-band images are shown for all the observed
sources and R-K colours are given for most of them. Spectroscopic redshifts
were obtained for 168 X-ray sources, of which 137 have both reliable optical
identification and redshift estimate (including 16 external identifications).
The R<24 observed sample comprises 161 X-ray objects (181 optical counterparts)
and 126 of them have unambiguous spectroscopic identification. We introduce a
new classification based solely on X-ray properties, HR and X-ray luminosity,
consistent with the unified AGN model. This X-ray classification uncovers a
large fraction of optically obscured, X-ray luminous AGNs missed by the
classical optical classification.

calculation is potentially relevant to the formation of massive stars in
ultradense cores of stellar clusters. We find that radiative feedback is
\emph{more effective} than in the case of previous calculations in spherical
symmetry. The Bondi-Hoyle geometry implies that material is flowing nearly
tangentially when it experiences the sharp radiative impulse at the dust
destruction radius, and consequently it is readily perturbed into outflowing
orbits. We find that it is difficult for stellar masses to grow beyond around
10 M_sol (for standard interstellar dust abundances). We discuss the possible
implications of this result for the formation mechanism of OB stars in cluster
cores. We end by proposing a series of conditions which must be fulfilled if
Bondi--Hoyle accretion is to continue.

supersaturated star VXR45 (P = 0.223 days) has shown that its corona has
discrete dark and bright X-ray regions. We suggest that due to the rapid
rotation, the X-ray emitting corona has been centrifugally stripped away,
creating open field regions that are dark in X-rays. This leads naturally both
to a significant rotational modulation in X-rays but also to the lower X-ray
luminosity of supersaturated stars compared to those rotating more slowly. To
demonstrate the effect, we take as an example a more slowly rotating star for
which surface magnetograms are available. We extrapolate the potential coronal
magnetic field based on these magnetograms and determine for a hydrostatic,
isothermal atmosphere the structure of the density and of the optically-thin
X-ray emission. We show that if the rotation rate of this star were increased,
the magnitude of the X-ray luminosity would decrease while its rotational

(1992). Two of them had no obvious Seyfert features in their previous optical
spectra: IRAS 14201+2956, and IRAS 21582+1018. The latter was bright enough to
also allow SWS observations around selected neon lines, to establish its
excitation. While both PHOT-S spectra are characteristic of starburst-dominated
galaxies, the neon line ratios in IRAS 21582+1018 indicate the presence of a
hard excitation source. New, high-resolution, optical spectra show only a weak,
broad component around Halpha, classifying now these two objects as Sey 1.9
galaxies. The two other galaxies observed are the NLS1 galaxies Mrk 359 and Mrk
1388. Their ISO spectra however do not reveal the typical, strong PAH features
found in the starburst galaxies and are more like those of standard Seyferts.
These results show therefore that, although IR observations were expected to be
able to always reveal the presence of an active nucleus by piercing through the
central obscuration, the result may be ambiguous: the broad band IR energy
distribution can still be dominated by starburts located in a circumnuclear
region, and the AGN appear only in specific observations (high-excitation lines
in the IR, or optical spectra with better quality than classification spectra).
The obscuration needs however to be patchy rather than complete, to explain the
detection of the high-excitation lines or broad Balmer wings. Only high-energy
observations can then establish the strength of the central
  AGN and the amount of extinction with certainty.

systems predicts a constitutive equation that couples the stress field to the
local microstructure. The theory could not be applied to macroscopic systems
because the constitutive equation becomes trivial upon straightforward
coarse-graining. This problem is resolved here for arbitrary planar structures.
The solution is based on the observation that staggered order makes it possible
to couple the stress to a reduced geometric tensor that can be coarse-grained.
The method proposed here makes it possible to apply this idea to realistic
systems whose staggered order is generally 'frustrated'. This is achieved by a
renormalization procedure which removes the frustration and enables the use of
the upscalable reduced tensor. As an example we calculate the stress due to a

\textbf{28}, 693 (1973)]. The elastic constants in the free energy are obtained

of quantum mechanics in curved surface [Jensen and Koppe, Ann. Phys.

taking the first order variation of the total free energy containing the
elastic free energy, the surface tension energy and the term induced by osmotic
pressure. The critical pressure, above which spherical polymer vesicle will
lose its stability, is obtained by taking the second order variation of the

experiments at both long and short distances. The problem is that consistency
with long distance experiments requires the graviton mass to be very small.
Such a small graviton mass however implies an ultraviolet cutoff for the theory
at length scales far larger than the millimeter scale at which gravity has
already been measured. In this paper we attempt to construct a model which
avoids this problem. We consider a brane world setup in warped AdS spacetime
and we investigate the consequences of writing a mass term for the graviton on
a the infrared brane where the local cutoff is of order a large (galactic)
distance scale. The advantage of this setup is that the low cutoff for physics
on the infrared brane does not significantly affect the predictivity of the
theory for observers localized on the ultraviolet brane. For such observers the
predictions of this theory agree with general relativity at distances smaller
than the infrared scale but go over to those of a theory of massive gravity at
longer distances. A careful analysis of the graviton two-point function,
however, reveals the presence of a ghost in the low energy spectrum. A mode
decomposition of the higher dimensional theory reveals that the ghost
corresponds to the radion field. We also investigate the theory with a brane
localized mass for the graviton on the ultraviolet brane, and show that the
physics of this case is similar to that of a conventional four dimensional
theory with a massive graviton, but with one important difference: when the
infrared brane decouples and the would-be massive graviton gets heavier than

theory. Their stability requires that the string carries a nontrivial twist, or
then it is knotted. Since a twist can be either left-handed or right-handed,
this implies that the glueball spectrum must be degenerate. This degeneracy
becomes consistent with experimental observations, when we identify the
$\eta_L(1410)$ component of the $\eta(1440)$ pseudoscalar as a $0^{-+}$
glueball, degenerate in mass with the widely accepted $0^{++}$ glueball
$f_0(1500)$. In addition of qualitative similarities, we find that these two
states also share quantitative similarity in terms of equal production ratios,
which we view as further evidence that their structures must be very similar.
We explain how our string picture of glueballs can be obtained from Yang-Mills
theory, by employing a decomposed gauge field. We also consider various
experimental consequences of our proposal, including the interactions between
glueballs and quarks and the possibility to employ glueballs as probes for
extra dimensions: The coupling of strong interactions to higher dimensions
seems to imply that absolute color confinement becomes lost.

orthogonal polynomials. We write the eigenfunctions of this operator by means
of a new Taylor formula for operators of Askey-Wilson type. This gives rise to
some expressions for the eigenfunctions, which are unknown in such a general
setting. Our methods also give a general Rodrigues formula from which several
well known formulas of Rodrigues type can be obtained directly. Moreover, other
new Rodrigues type formulas come out when seeking for regular solutions of the
associated functional equations. The main difference here is that, in contrast
with the formulas appearing in the literature, we get non-ramified solutions
which are useful for applications in combinatorics. Another fact, that becomes
clear in this paper, is the role played by the theory of elliptic functions in
the connection between ramified and non-ramified solutions.

boundaries of convex polytopes in arbitrary dimension and their metric
geometry.
  Let S be the boundary of a convex polytope of dimension d+1, or more
generally let S be a `convex polyhedral pseudomanifold'. We prove that S has a
polyhedral nonoverlapping unfolding into R^d, so the metric space S is obtained
from a closed (usually nonconvex) polyhedral ball in R^d by identifying pairs
of boundary faces isometrically. Our existence proof exploits geodesic flow
away from a source point v in S, which is the exponential map to S from the
tangent space at v. We characterize the `cut locus' (the closure of the set of
points in S with more than one shortest path to v) as a polyhedral complex in
terms of Voronoi diagrams on facets. Analyzing infinitesimal expansion of the
wavefront consisting of points at constant distance from v on S produces an
algorithmic method for constructing Voronoi diagrams in each facet, and hence
the unfolding of S. The algorithm, for which we provide pseudocode, solves the
discrete geodesic problem. Its main construction generalizes the source
unfolding for boundaries of 3-polytopes into R^2. We present conjectures
concerning the number of shortest paths on the boundaries of convex polyhedra,
and concerning continuous unfolding of convex polyhedra. We also comment on the
intrinsic non-polynomial complexity of nonconvex polyhedral manifolds.

discussing these new anionic states which exclusively exist in the presence of

anions when exposed to magnetic fields. The magnetically induced states
constitute an infinite manifold assuming that the nucleus of the anion is
infinitely heavy. At laboratory field strengths the corresponding binding
energies show two different scaling properties belonging to the ground
($\propto B^2$) and the excited ($\propto B^3$) magnetically induced states. We
provide a detailed discussion of the physics of the moving anion taking into
account the coupling between the anionic centre of mass and its electronic
degrees of freedom. A number of field-adapted techniques exploiting exact
constants of motion and the adiabatic separation of motions are applied to
simplify the Hamiltonian that describes the effective interaction between the
centre of mass and the electronic degrees of freedom. Employing classical
simulations the autodetachment process of the anions in the field is observed
and a rich variety of spectral properties of moving anions is predicted:
depending on the parameters, such as the mass and polarizability of the neutral
system as well as the field strength, induced bound states, resonances and
detaching states of the corresponding anions are to be expected. An outline of
an {\it{ab initio}} quantum approach is provided that allows quantum dynamical
investigations of the moving anion.

motion has been detected in at least seven experiments. As well this
experimental data also reveals the existence of a gravitational wave phenomena
associated with the in-flow. It is shown that Galilean Relativity and Special
Relativity are in fact compatible, contrary to current beliefs: absolute motion
actually causes the special relativity effects. The new theory of gravity
passes all the tests of the previous Newtonian and General Relativity theories,
but in addition resolves the numerous gravitational anomalies such as the
spiral galaxy `dark matter' effect, the absence of `dark matter' in elliptical
galaxies, the inconsistencies in measuring G, the borehole g anomaly, and

system from which it was developed has too high a spherical symmetry to have
revealed key aspects of the phenomena of gravity, and that General Relativity
inherited these flaws. The data are revealing that space has structure, and so

multiple inhomogeneous layers featuring variable linear velocity vertical shear
and startificaion in horizontal space and time. This is achieved by writing the
layer velocity and buoyancy fields as linear functions of depth, with
coefficients that depend arbitrarily on horizontal position and time. The model
is a generalization of Ripa's (1995) single-layer model to an arbitrary number
of layers. Unlike models with homogeneous layers the present model is able to
represent thermodynamics processes driven by heat and freshwater fluxes through
the surface or mixing processes resulting from fluid exchanges across
contiguous layers. A model configuration with only one layer has been
previously shown to provide: a very good representation of the exact vertical
normal modes up to the first internal mode; an exact representation of
long-perturbation (free boundary) baroclinic instability; and a very reasonable
representation of short-perturbation (classical Eady) baroclinic instability.
Here it is shown that substantially more accurate overall results with respect
to single-layer calculations can be achieved by considering a stack of only a
few layers. A similar behavior is found in ageostrophic (classical Stone)
baroclinic instability by describing accurately the dependence of the solutions
on the Richardson number with only two layers.

  We propose algorithmic and experimental improvements that make CAPSS a viable
option for sequencing a set of BACs. We provide the first probabilistic model
of CAPSS sequencing progress. The model leads to theoretical results supporting
previous, less formal arguments on the practicality of CAPSS. We demonstrate
the usefulness of CAPS-MAP for clone overlap detection with a probabilistic
analysis, and a simulated assembly of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Our
analysis indicates that CAPS-MAP is well-suited for detecting BAC overlaps in a
highly redundant library, relying on a low amount of shotgun sequence
information. Consequently, it is a practical method for computing the physical
ordering of clones in a random library, without requiring additional clone
fingerprinting. Since CAPS-MAP requires only shotgun sequence reads, it can be
seamlessly incorporated into a sequencing project with almost no experimental
overhead.

observe an improvement of the survival rates while the genetic fitness of the

cannot be implemented by multiple-copy transformation for pure states. This
fact, together with the result we obtained in [R. Y. Duan, Y. Feng, X. Li, and
M. S. Ying, Phys. Rev. A 71, 042319 (2005)] that the latter can be completely
implemented by the former, indicates that catalyst-assisted transformation is
strictly more powerful than multiple-copy transformation. For purely
probabilistic setting we find, however, these two kinds of transformations are
geometrically equivalent in the sense that the sets of pure states which can be
converted into a given pure state with maximal probabilities not less than a
given value have the same closure, no matter catalyst-assisted transformation
or multiple-copy transformation is used.

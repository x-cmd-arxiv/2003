NGC4438 and NGC4435 in the Virgo Cluster. X-ray emission in NGC4438 is observed
in a ~700 pc nuclear region, a 2.3 kpc spherical bulge, and a network of
filaments extending 4-10 kpc to the W and SW of the galaxy. The X-ray emission
in all 3 regions is highly correlated to similar features observed in Halpha.
Spectra of the filaments and bulge are well represented by a 0.4 keV MEKAL
model with combined 0.3-2 keV intrinsic luminosity of 1.24x10^{40}erg/s,
electron densities ~ 0.02-0.04 cm^{-3}, cooling times of 400-700 Myr and X-ray
gas mass <~ 3.7x10^8 Msolar. In the nuclear region of NGC4438 X-ray emission is
seen from the nucleus and from two outflow bubbles extending 360(730) pc to the
NW(SE) of the nucleus. The spectrum of the NW outflow bubble plus nucleus is
well fitted by an absorbed (n_H=1.9x10^{21} cm^{-2}) 0.58 keV MEKAL plasma
model plus a heavily absorbed (n_H = 2.9 x10^{22} cm^{-2}) Gamma = 2, power law
component. The electron density, cooling time, and X-ray gas mass in the NW
outflow are ~0.5 cm^{-3}, 30 Myr and 3.5x10^6 Msolar. Weak X-ray emission is
observed in the central region of NGC4435 with the peak of the hard emission
coincident with the galaxy's optical center; while the peak of the soft X-ray
emission is displaced 316 pc to the NE. The spectrum of NGC 4435 is well fitted
by a non-thermal power law plus a thermal component from 0.2-0.3 keV diffuse
ISM gas. We argue that the X-ray properties of gas outside the nuclear region
in NGC4438 and in NGC4435 favor a high velocity, off-center collision between
these galaxies ~ 100 Myr ago; while the nuclear X-ray emitting outflow gas in
NGC4438 has been heated only recently (within ~ 1-2 Myr) by shocks (v_s ~ 600
kms^{-1}) possibly powered by a central AGN.

call these objects ""CFRS H\alpha-single"" galaxies and have re-observed a

more normal emission line galaxies. Good S/N spectroscopy at the VLT and the
CFHT, with moderate spectral resolution (R>600), reveals that the ""CFRS

extinctions (A_V>2), high stellar masses and over-solar oxygen abundances. The
present study shows that it is hard to derive the detailed properties of
galaxies (gas chemical abundances, interstellar extinction, stellar population,
star formation rates and history) using spectra with resolution below 600. One
major drawback is indeed that the underlying Balmer absorption cannot be
estimated properly, which could cause the SFRs be either underestimated or
overestimated by factors reaching 10 (average 3.1) for the sample galaxies.
These effects are prominent for a large fraction of evolved massive galaxies
especially those experiencing successive bursts (A and F stars dominating their
absorption spectra). Further estimates of the cosmic star formation density at
all redshifts mandatorily requires moderate resolution spectroscopy to avoid
severe biases.

narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy I Zw 1 performed in June 2002. The 0.6-12 keV
spectrum is well described by a steep power-law (Gamma\sim 2.3) and a weak soft
blackbody component (kT \sim 200 eV) below 2 kev. The soft X-ray excess
emission is featureless and contributes only about 10% to the total X-ray
emission in the $0.6-2\kev$ band. There are tentative evidences for an iron
iron Kalpha line and an iron K edge, both from high ionized He-like iron. The
0.6-12kev continuum of I Zw 1 can be explained in terms of a blackbody (kT \sim
40eV), thermal comptonization and its reflection off the surface of an ionized
accretion disk. We note that characterizing the soft excess copmonent `above a
power law continuum' may not be appropriate due to the low energy curvature of
a comptonized spectrum. X-ray emission from I Zw 1 was highly variabile during
the observation. I Zw 1 showed a large, symmetric X-ray flare during which the
X-ray luminosity increased by about 6e43 erg/s in an interval of 2800s only.
The X-ray spectral variability was unusual during the flare. In contrast to the
general observation of spectral steepening with flux from Seyfert galaxies,
there is a clear evidence for hardening of the 0.6-10kev spectrum of I Zw 1
with increasing flux. This hardening is due to a stronger and slightly flatter
power-law component at higher flux without any change in the soft X-ray excess
component. The large flare, the accompanying spectral flattening, and the
steady nature of the soft excess component may be due to an additional flatter
power-law component during the flare possibly arising as a result of ejection
of electron plasma and the SSC process.

2000 which occured shortly after an outburst. Ramsay et al (2001a) found a
prominent energy dependent modulation at a period of 2240 sec: this modulation
was only seen for app. 1/3 of the observation duration. In our new analysis, we
examine this time interval in greater detail. In addition to the 2240 sec
period we find evidence for other periods, the most prominent being near 3500
sec. Both these modulations are most likely due to changes in photoelectric
absorption over this period: this is supported by phase-resolved spectroscopy.
This may indicate the presence of matter above the accretion disc or a presence
of a magnetic accretion curtain. In this case the 2240 sec period could
represent a spin period of the white dwarf and the 3500 sec period a beat
period between the spin and orbital periods. We also model the B band and UV
eclipse profiles and light curves using a new technique to map the spatial
extent of the accretion disc. As a result we find that whilst the optical
emission is dominated by both the emission close to the accretion disc boundary
layer and the hot spot where the accretion stream hits the disc, the UV
emission is mainly dominated by the inner disc/boundary layer only.

optical and X-ray properties (derived from the spectral analysis of the

spectral type and the X-ray absorption properties supports the AGN unified
model. Only one object that does not fit the relation between optical and X-ray

the X-ray band (NH<1.3x10^20 cm^-2). In total, 7 sources out of 27 are heavily
obscured in the X-ray (NH>10^22 cm^-2), corresponding to a surface density of
0.7 deg^-2 at the flux limit the sample (4-7x10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 in the

large (intrinsic) luminosity (L_[2-10keV]>10^44 erg s^-1) and are thus
classified as type 2 QSO. Finally, we have compared the fraction of X-ray
absorbed AGNs (26%) with that predicted by the current XRB synthesis models at

Initially, a non-spherically symmetric, electromagnetically-dominated bubble

and most of the electron-positron pairs annihilate, the bubble expansion
becomes highly relativistic. After the end of the source activity most of the

acceleration of pairs which are responsible for the $\gamma$-ray burst. At

in it, at random times but constant average rate. It is critical to test
whether the statistics of the coincidence counts is Poisson, because the counts
in a single detector often are not. At some point a number of parameters are
tuned to increase the chance of detection by reducing the expected background:
source direction, epoch vetoes based on sensitivity, goodness-of-fit
thresholds, etc. Therefore, the significance of the confidence intervals itself
has to be renormalized. This review is an insight of the state-of-the-art

them with high S/N Galactic globular cluster data. We observe a weak trend of
decreasing [alpha/Fe] with increasing metallicity in the NGC 524 clusters.
Analysis of the cluster system kinematics reveals that the full sample exhibits
a rotation of 114+/-60 km/s around a position angle of 22+/-27 deg, and a
velocity dispersion of 186+/-29 km/s at a mean radius of 89 arcsec from the

obtained and comparisons of the depths of water vapor absorption bands in our

temperatures and stellar luminosities which, when combined with theoretical

spectrum taking finite lifetime of cold dark matter into account. We find the
finite lifetime of dark matter decreases the power at large scale ($l < 4000$)

dependence of other cosmological parameters such as the amplitude of mass
fluctuations $\sigma_{8}$ and the cosmological constant $\Omega_{\lambda}$
(under the assumption of a flat universe) which mainly change the normalization
of the angular power spectrum. This difference allows one to determine the
lifetime and other cosmological parameters rather separately. We also
investigate sensitivity of a future SZ survey to the cosmological parameters
including the life time, assuming a fiducial model $\Gamma^{-1} = 10 h^{-1}
{\rm Gyr}$, $\sigma_{8} = 1.0$, and $\Omega_{\lambda} = 0.7$. We show that

observations of the GRB030329 optical transient (OT), which almost coincide in
time with the first ""break"" (t ~ 0.5 day after the GRB) of the OT light curve.
The BTA/MPFS (Multi Pupil Fiber Spectrograph) spectra are clearly not smooth:
the OT spectra showed a continuum with several broad spectral features at about
4000, 4450, 5900AA. The OT spectrum showed some evolution starting from the
first night after the burst, and the beginning of spectral changes are seen as
early as ~10-12 hours after the GRB. The onset of the spectral changes for t <
1 day indicates that the contribution from Type Ic supernova (SN) into the OT
optical flux can be detected earlier. So, summarizing our and other
spectroscopic data on the OT we confirm the evolution of the OT spectrum and
color pointed also by other authors (Hjorth et al. 2003; Matheson et al.
2003b). The early spectra of GRB030329/SN2003dh properties can be consistent
with a shock moving into a stellar wind formed from the pre-SN. Such a behavior
(similar to one near the UV shock breakout in SNe) can be explained by the
existence of a dense matter in the immediate surroundings of GRB/SN progenitor.

observed metal enrichment and Iron Mass-to-Light Ratio in clusters of galaxies.
We address this problem by means of straightforward estimates that should hold
independently of the details of chemical evolution models.
  It is crucial to compute self-consistently the amount of mass and metals
locked-up in stars, by accounting for the stellar mass-to-light ratio predicted
by a given IMF. It becomes then clear that a ""standard"" Solar Neighbourhood IMF
cannot provide enough metals to account for the observed chemical properties in
clusters: clusters of galaxies and the local environment must be characterized
by different IMFs.
  Alternatively, if we require the IMF to be universal, in order to explain
clusters such an IMF must be much more efficient in metal production than
usually estimated for the Solar Vicinity. In this case, substantial loss of
metals is required from the Solar Neighbourhood and from disc galaxies in
general. This ""non-standard"" scenario for the local chemical evolution would
challenge our present understanding of the Milky Way and of disc galaxy
formation.

are just the paths of least action. This distribution naturally leads to
important laws of normal diffusion. A conclusion of this work is that, for
probabilistic mechanics or irregular dynamics, the principle of maximization of
path information is equivalent to the least action principle for regular
dynamics.
  We also show that an average path information between the initial phase
volume and the final phase volume can be related to the entropy change defined
with natural invariant measure of dynamic system. Hence the principles of least
action and maximum path information suggest the maximum entropy change. This
result is used for some chaotic systems evolving in fractal phase space in

mode at 8 GHz and a longitudinal acoustic (LA) mode at 60 GHz. The SRW mode
frequency shows a minimum at the Verwey transition temperature $T_V$ of 123 K.
The softening of the SRW mode frequency from about 250 K to $T_V$ can be
quantitatively understood as a result of a decrease in the shear elastic
constant C$_{44}$, arising from the coupling of shear strain to charge
fluctuations. On the other hand, the LA mode frequency does not show any
significant change around $T_V$, but shows a large change in its intensity. The
latter shows a maximum at around 120 K in the cooling run and at 165 K in the
heating run, exhibiting a large hysteresis of 45 K. This significant change in
intensity may be related to the presence of stress-induced ordering of
Fe$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$ at the octahedral sites, as well as to stress-induced
domain wall motion.

how the field theory reveals the glassy nature of the dynamics, in particular
divergent barriers and barrier distributions controling the spectrum of
relaxation times. A naive single relaxation time approximation for each
wavevector is found to be unsatisfactory. A second approximation based on a
random friction model, yields a size (L) dependent log-normal distribution of
relaxation times (mean barriers ~L^\theta and variance ~ L^{\theta/2}) and a
procedure to estimate dynamical scaling functions. Finally, we study the full
structure of the running dynamical effective action within the field theory. We
find that relaxation time distributions are non-trivial (broad but not
log-normal) and encoded in a closed hierarchy of FRG equations. A thermal
boundary layer ansatz (TBLA) appears as a consistent solution. It extends the
one discovered in the statics which was shown to embody droplet thermal
fluctuations. Although perturbative control remains a challenge, the structure
of the dynamical TBLA which encodes barrier distributions opens the way for
deeper understanding of the field theory approach to glasses.

determines the (2-modified) Fredholm determinants in terms of solutions of
closely associated Volterra integral equations, and as a result offers a
natural way to compute such determinants.
  We illustrate our approach by identifying classical objects such as the Jost
function for half-line Schr\""odinger operators and the inverse transmission
coefficient for Schr\""odinger operators on the real line as Fredholm
determinants, and rederiving the well-known expressions for them in due course.
We also apply our formalism to Floquet theory of Schr\""odinger operators, and
upon identifying the connection between the Floquet discriminant and underlying
Fredholm determinants, we derive new representations of the Floquet
discriminant.
  Finally, we rederive the explicit formula for the 2-modified Fredholm
determinant corresponding to a convolution integral operator, whose kernel is
associated with a symbol given by a rational function, in a straghtforward
manner. This determinant formula represents a Wiener-Hopf analog of Day's
formula for the determinant associated with finite Toeplitz matrices generated
by the Laurent expansion of a rational function.

representations) is an infinite-dimensional space. For such Gelfand pairs, the
conventional scheme of harmonic analysis is not applicable and it has to be
suitably modified.
  We construct a compactification of S called the space of virtual
permutations. It is no longer a group but it is still a G-space. On this space,
there exists a unique G-invariant probability measure which should be viewed as
a true substitute of Haar measure. More generally, we define a 1-parameter
family of probability measures on virtual permutations, which are
quasi-invariant under the action of G.
  Using these measures we construct a family {T_z} of unitary representations
of G depending on a complex parameter z. We prove that any T_z admits a unique
decomposition into a multiplicity free integral of irreducible spherical
representations of (G,K). Moreover, the spectral types of different
representations (which are defined by measures on the spherical dual) are
pairwise disjoint.
  Our main result concerns the case of integral values of parameter z: then we
obtain an explicit decomposition of T_z into irreducibles. The case of
nonintegral z is quite different. It was studied by Borodin and Olshanski, see
e.g. the survey math.RT/0311369.

chiral sigma model in the framework of the relativistic mean field theory. We
reconstruct an extended chiral sigma model in which the omega meson mass is
generated dynamically by the sigma condensation in the vacuum in the same way
as the nucleon mass. All the parameters of chiral sigma model are essentially
fixed from the hadron properties in the free space. In nuclear matter, the
saturation property comes out right, but the incompressibility is too large and
the scalar and vector potentials are about a half of the phenomenological ones,
respectively. This fact is reflected to the properties of finite nuclei. We
calculate N = Z even-even mass nuclei between N = 16 and N = 34. The extended
chiral sigma model without the pion mean field leads to the result that the
magic number appears at N = 18 instead of N = 20 and the magic number does not
appear at N = 28 due to the above mentioned nuclear matter properties. The
latter problem, however, could be removed by the introduction of the finite
pion mean field with the appearance of the magic number at N = 28. We find that
the energy differences between the spin-orbit partners are reproduced by the
finite pion mean field which is completely a different mechanism from the
standard spin-orbit interaction.

short-term precursors the newly introduced chains of earthquakes reflecting the
rise of an earthquake correlation range; and detect (retrospectively) such
chains a few months before two prominent Californian earthquakes - Landers,
1992, M = 7.6, and Hector Mine, 1999, M = 7.3, with one false alarm. Similar
results (described elsewhere) are obtained by RDP for 21 more strong
earthquakes in California (M >= 6.4), Japan (M >= 7.0) and the Eastern
Mediterranean (M >= 6.5). Validation of the RDP approach requires, as always,
prediction in advance for which this study sets up a base. We have the first
case of advance prediction; it was reported before Tokachi-oki earthquake (near
Hokkaido island, Japan), Sept. 25, 2003, M = 8.1. RDP has potentially important
applications to other precursors and to prediction of other critical phenomena
besides earthquakes. In particular, it might vindicate some short-term
precursors, previously rejected as giving too many false alarms.

quantum dot array. The unknown qubit is encoded using a pair of quantum dots,
coupled by tunneling, with one excess electron. It is shown how to create
maximally entangled states with this kind of qubits using an adiabatically
increasing Coulomb repulsion between different pairs. This entangled states are
exploited to perform teleportation again using an adiabatic coupling between
them and the incoming unknown state. Finally, a sudden separation of Bob's
qubit enables a time evolution of Alice's state providing a modified version of
standard Bell measurement. Substituting the four quantum dots entangled state
with a chain of coupled DQD's, a quantum channel with high fidelity arises from
this scheme allowing the transmission over long distances.

Heisenberg-limited interferometer with the particle number N, in the case of
the Bayesian detection procedure proposed by Holland and Burnett [p.r.l. 71, p.
1355 (1993)] for twin boson input modes. Using Monte Carlo simulations for up
to 10,000 bosons, we show that the phase error of a nonideal interferometer
scales with the Heisenberg limit if the losses are of the order of N^-1.
Greater losses degrade the scaling which is then in N^-1/2, like the shot-noise
limit, yet the sensitivity stays sub-shot-noise as long as photon correlations
are present. These results give the actual limits of Bayesian detection for
twin-mode interferometry and prove that it is an experimentally feasible
scheme, contrary to what is implied by the coincidence-detection analysis of
Kim et al. [p.r.a. 60, p. 708 (1999)].

superoperator may not be completely positive. We then go on to attack the
inverse problem of extracting an effective distribution of unitaries that
characterizes the incoherence via a perturbation theory analysis of the
superoperator eigenvalue spectra.

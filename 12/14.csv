with the shear field from a background population of source galaxies scales
with the source redshift in a way that is specific to lensing. Such a
source-scaling can be exploited to effectively measure geometrical distances as
a function of redshift and thereby constrain dark energy properties, free of
any assumptions about the galaxy-mass/mass power spectrum (its shape, amplitude
or growth). Such a geometrical method can yield a ~ 0.03 - 0.07 f_{sky}^{-1/2}
measurement on the dark energy abundance and equation of state, for a
photometric redshift accuracy of dz ~ 0.01 - 0.05 and a survey with median
redshift of ~ 1. While these constraints are weaker than conventional weak
lensing methods, they provide an important consistency check because the
geometrical method carries less theoretical baggage: there is no need to assume
any structure formation model (e.g. CDM). The geometrical method is at the most
conservative end of a whole spectrum of methods which obtain smaller errorbars
by making more restrictive assumptions -- we discuss some examples. Our
geometrical approach differs from previous investigations along similar lines
in three respects. First, the source-scaling we propose to use is less
demanding on the photometric redshift accuracy. Second, the scaling works for
both galaxy-shear and shear-shear correlations. Third, we find that previous
studies underestimate the statistical errors associated with similar
geometrical methods, the origin of which is discussed.

from the Parkes radio telescope on the coincident young pulsar J1747-2958. We
find that G359.23-0.82 is a very luminous X-ray source (L_X [0.5-8.0 keV] =
5e34 ergs/s for a distance of 5 kpc), whose morphology consists of a bright
head coincident with PSR J1747-2958, plus a 45""-long narrow tail whose
power-law spectrum steepens with distance from the pulsar. We thus confirm that
G359.23-0.82 is a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula powered by PSR J1747-2958; the
nebular stand-off distance implies that the pulsar is moving with a Mach number
of ~60, suggesting a space velocity ~600 km/s through gas of density ~0.3
cm^-3. We combine the theory of ion-dominated pulsar winds with hydrodynamic
simulations of pulsar bow shocks to show that a bright elongated X-ray and
radio feature extending 10'' behind the pulsar represents the surface of the
wind termination shock. The X-ray and radio ""trails"" seen in other pulsar bow
shocks may similarly represent the surface of the termination shock, rather
than particles in the postshock flow as is usually argued. The tail of the
Mouse contains two components: a relatively broad region seen only at radio
wavelengths, and a narrow region seen in both radio and X-rays. We propose that
the former represents material flowing from the wind shock ahead of the
pulsar's motion, while the latter corresponds to more weakly magnetized
material streaming from the backward termination shock. This study represents
the first consistent attempt to apply our understanding of ""Crab-like"" nebulae
to the growing group of bow shocks around high-velocity pulsars.

  General model predictions","18 pages, 12 figures, submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present model calculations for the expected surface density of Ly-$\alpha$
emitting primeval galaxies (PGs) at high redshifts. We assume that elliptical
galaxies and bulges of spiral galaxies (= spheroids) formed early in the
universe and that the Ly-$\alpha$ emitting PGs are these spheroids during their
first burst of star formation at high redshift. One of the main assumptions of
the models is that the Ly-$\alpha$ bright phase of this first starburst in the
spheroids is confined to a short period after its onset due to rapid formation
of dust. The models do not only explain the failure of early surveys for
Ly-$\alpha $ emitting PGs but are also consistent with the limits of new
surveys (e.g. the Calar Alto Deep Imaging Survey - CADIS). At faint detection
limits $S_{lim} \le 10^{-20}$W/m$^2$ the surface density of Ly-$\alpha$
emitters is expected to vary only weakly in the redshift range between $z=3$
and $z=6$ with values $> 10^3 / {deg}^2 / \Delta z = 0.1 $ reaching its maximum
at $z_0 \approx 4$. At shallower detection limits, $S_{lim} \ge 3\times
10^{-20}$W/m$^2$ the surface density of high-z Ly-$\alpha$ emitters is expected
to be a steep function of redshift and detection limit. This explains the low
success in finding bright Ly-$\alpha$ galaxies at $z > 5$. We demonstrate how
the observed surface densities of Ly-$\alpha $ emitting PGs derived from recent
surveys constrain the parameters of our models. Finally, we discuss the
possibility that two Ly-$\alpha$ bright phases occur in the formation process
of galaxies: An initial -- primeval -- phase in which dust is virtually
non-existing, and a secondary later phase in which strong galactic winds as
observed in some Lyman break galaxies facilitate the escape of Ly-$\alpha $
photons after dust has already been formed.

owes its celebrity to possibly being the youngest and closest starburst galaxy
known. Our observations in the infrared and millimeter contribute to shed light
on the properties of this interesting object. We have used our new data along
with data from the literature to study the properties of the young stellar
clusters present in NGC 5253. We find that the brightest optical clusters are
all characterized by a near-infrared excess that is explained by the combined
effect of extinction and emission by dust. For the brightest infrared cluster
we model the spectral energy distribution from the optical to the radio. We
find that this cluster dominates the galaxy emission longward of 3 \mic, that
it has a bolometric luminosity of $1.2~10^9 L_{\odot}$ and a mass of $1.2~10^6
M_{\odot}$, giving $L/M\approx10^3$. The cluster is obscured by 7 mag of
optical extinction produced by about 1.5 10$^{5}$ $M_{\odot}$ of dust. The dust
properties are peculiar with respect to the dust properties in the solar
neighbourhood with a composition characterized by a lack of silicates and a
flatter size distribution than the standard one, i.e. a bias toward larger
grains. We find that NGC 5253 is a striking example of a galaxy where the
infrared-submillimeter and ultraviolet-optical emissions originate in totally
decoupled regions of vastly different physical sizes.

field in the plane of the sky relative to the orientation of the
integral-shaped filament varies considerably as one moves from north to south.
While in IRAS 05327-0457 and OMC-3 MMS 1-6 the projection of the field is
primarily perpendicular to the filament it becomes better aligned with it at
OMC-3 MMS 8-9 and well aligned with it at OMC-2 FIR 6. The OMC-2 FIR 4 cloud,
located between the last two, is a peculiar object where we find almost no
polarization. The projected angle of the field is more complicated in OMC-1
where it exhibits smooth variations in its orientation across the face of this
massive complex. By combining the polarimetry and spectroscopic data we were
able to measure a set of average values for the inclination angle of the
magnetic field relative to the line of sight. We find that the field is
oriented quite close to the plane of the sky in most places. More precisely,
the inclination of the magnetic field is ~73 deg. around OMC-3 MMS 6, ~74 deg.

direction the density decreases such that this segment is accelerated by the
pressure inside the bubble, then this accelerated region is RT-unstable. The
outermost region, relative to the center of the system, is the most likely to
become unstable because there the density gradient is the steepest. Using
simple analytical analysis, I find that off-center fat bubbles in PNs are much
less stable than in clusters. In PNs bubbles become unstable when they are very
small relative to their distance from the center; they can be stabilized
somewhat if the mass loss rate from the stellar progenitor decreases for a
time, such that the negative density gradient is much shallower. In clusters
fat bubbles become unstable when their size is comparable to their distance
from the center. I discuss some implications of this instability in clusters

average mass of strong Ba stars (1.5Msun). For mild Ba star HD 27271 and HD

which we investigate the influence of rotation and large-scale magnetic fields
on the turbulent momentum and heat transport. The former is studied by
computing the Reynolds stresses, the latter by calculating the correlation of
velocity and temperature fluctuations, both as functions of rotation and
latitude. We find that the horisontal correlation, Q_(theta phi), capable of
generating horisontal differential rotation, is mostly negative in the southern
hemisphere for Coriolis numbers exceeding unity, corresponding to equatorward
flux of angular momentum in accordance with solar observations. The radial
component Q_(r phi) is negative for slow and intermediate rotation indicating
inward transport of angular momentum, while for rapid rotation, the transport
occurs outwards. Parametrisation in terms of the mean-field Lambda-effect shows
qualitative agreement with the turbulence model of Kichatinov & R\""udiger
(1993) for the horisontal part H \propto Q_(theta phi)/cos(theta), whereas for
the vertical part, V \propto Q_(r phi)/sin(theta), agreement only for
intermediate rotation exists. The Lambda-coefficients become suppressed in the
limit of rapid rotation, this rotational quenching being stronger for the V
component than for H. We find that the stresses are enhanced by the presence of
the magnetic field for field strengths up to and above the equipartition value,
without significant quenching. Concerning the turbulent heat transport, our
calculations show that the transport in the radial direction is most efficient
at the equatorial regions, obtains a minimum at midlatitudes, and shows a
slight increase towards the poles. The latitudinal heat transport does not show
a systematic trend as function of latitude or rotation.

2000 outburst and were obtained with BeppoSAX, XMM-Newton and RXTE. The data
cover unabsorbed 2--10 keV fluxes between 0.1 and 5.3 X 10^-9 erg/s/cm^2. The
equivalent luminosity range is 6 X 10^35 to 2 X 10^37 erg/s. The 0.3--10 keV
spectrum is well described by a combination of a multi-temperature disk
blackbody, a hot Comptonization component and a narrow Fe-K emission line at
6.5 to 6.8 keV with an equivalent width of up to 285 eV. The hydrogen column
density in the line of sight is (8.8+/-0.5) X 10^22 cm^-2. The most conspicuous
spectral changes in this model are represented by variations of the temperature
and radius of the inner edge of the accretion disk, and a jump of the
equivalent width of the Fe-K line in one observation. Furthermore, 45 type-I
X-ray bursts were unambiguously detected between 1998 and 2001 which all
occurred during or close to outbursts. We derive a distance of 7.5+/-1.3 kpc

expected phase, which implies that the accretion curtains are twisted, trailing

significant bulk pinning below the onset line $H_{on}(T)$ of the peak effect
implies that the Bragg glass phase is present for $H < H_{on}(T)$.
Interestingly, the unexpected absence of bulk pinning above the end point line

increase of the $H_{c2}^c(0)$ since the carbon doped MgB$_2$ becomes more dirty

concerns fluctuations in the phase space compression rate of dissipative,

expected to apply more generally. This raises the question of which non-Anosov
systems satisfy the fluctuation relation. We analyze time dependent
fluctuations in the phase space compression rate of a class of N-particle
systems that are at equilibrium or in near equilibrium steady states. This
class does not include Anosov systems or isoenergetic systems, however, it
includes most steady state systems considered in molecular dynamics simulations

smaller as the systems move further from equilibrium. In contrast, similar
fluctuation relations for an appropriately defined dissipation function appear
to hold both near and far from equilibrium.

This allows a common analytical solution of the Ornstein-Zernike integral

with Monte Carlo simulations shows that the PY approximation lies between
simpler closures, which may yield less accurate predictions but are easily

more precise predictions but can hardly be extended to mixtures. In regimes

phase from the so-called ""zero binding points"" $T_{zb}$ to the full

Wigner-Weyl modes meet. In doing this, we adopt the idea recently introduced by
Shuryak and Zahed for charmed $\bar c c$, light-quark $\bar q q$ mesons $\pi,
\sigma, \rho, A_1$ and gluons that at $T_{zb}$, the quark-anti-quark scattering
length goes through $\infty$ at which conformal invariance is restored, thereby
transforming the matter into a near perfect fluid behaving hydrodynamically, as
found at RHIC. We show that the binding of these states is accomplished by the
combination of (i) the color Coulomb interaction, (ii) the relativistic
effects, and (iii) the interaction induced by the instanton-anti-instanton
molecules. The spin-spin forces turned out to be small. While near $T_{zb}$ all
mesons are large-size nonrelativistic objects bound by Coulomb attraction, near
$T_c$ they get much more tightly bound, with many-body collective interactions
becoming important and making the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ masses approach zero (in
the chiral limit). The wave function at the origin grows strongly with binding,
and the near-local four-Fermi interactions induced by the instanton molecules
play an increasingly more important role as the temperature moves downward
toward $T_c$.

  Algebraic Computation (ACM, New York, 2003) 248--254",,,"math.AG",,"  In this note we discuss techniques for determining the automorphism group of
a genus $g$ hyperelliptic curve $\X_g$ defined over an algebraically closed
field $k$ of characteristic zero. The first technique uses the classical $GL_2
(k)$-invariants of binary forms. This is a practical method for curves of small
genus, but has limitations as the genus increases, due to the fact that such
invariants are not known for large genus.
  The second approach, which uses dihedral invariants of hyperelliptic curves,
is a very convenient method and works well in all genera. First we define the
normal decomposition of a hyperelliptic curve with extra automorphisms. Then
dihedral invariants are defined in terms of the coefficients of this normal
decomposition. We define such invariants independently of the automorphism
group $\Aut (\X_g)$. However, to compute such invariants the curve is required
to be in its normal form. This requires solving a nonlinear system of
equations.
  We find conditions in terms of classical invariants of binary forms for a
curve to have reduced automorphism group $A_4$, $S_4$, $A_5$. As far as we are
aware, such results have not appeared before in the literature.

while in the second one similar recipes are given only starting from
coisotropic subgroups. In both cases this yields a Galois-type correspondence,
where a quantum coisotropic subgroup is mapped to its complementary dual;
moreover, in the first formulation quantum coisotropic subgroups are
characterized as being the fixed points in this Galois' reciprocity. By the
natural link between quantum subgroups and quantum homogeneous spaces then we
argue a quantum duality principle for homogeneous spaces too, where quantum
coisotropic spaces are the fixed elements in a suitable Galois' reciprocity.
  As an application, we provide an explicit quantization of the space of Stokes
matrices with the Poisson structure given by Dubrovin and Ugaglia.

with the experimental data on hadron production. The enhancement of pion

any phase transition. However, the maximum in the $K^+/\pi^+$ ratio at 20 to 30

(Pb+Pb) collisions at bombarding energies above $\sim$ 5 A$\cdot$GeV, however,
the measured $K^{\pm}$ $m_{T}$-spectra have a larger inverse slope parameter
than expected from the calculations. The approximately constant slope of
$K^\pm$ spectra at SPS (the 'step') is not reproduced either. Thus the pressure
generated by hadronic interactions in the transport models above $\sim$ 5
A$\cdot$GeV is lower than observed in the experimental data. This finding
suggests that the additional pressure - as expected from lattice QCD
calculations at finite quark chemical potential and temperature - might be
generated by strong interactions in the early pre-hadronic/partonic phase of
central Au+Au (Pb+Pb) collisions.

based on quark, diquark, string and hadronic degrees of freedom, but do not
include any explicit phase transition to a quark-gluon plasma. From our
dynamical calculations we find that both models do not describe the maximum in
the $K^+/\pi^+$ ratio at 20 - 30 AGeV in central Au+Au collisions found
experimentally, though the excitation functions of strange mesons are
reproduced well in HSD and UrQMD. Furthermore, the transport calculations show
that the charmonium recreation by $D+\bar{D} \to J/\Psi + meson$ reactions is
comparable to the dissociation by 'comoving' mesons at RHIC energies contrary
to SPS energies. This leads to the final result that the total $J/\Psi$
suppression as a function of centrality at RHIC should be less than the
suppression seen at SPS energies where the 'comover' dissociation is
substantial and the backward channels play no role. Furthermore, our transport
calculations -- in comparison to experimental data on transverse momentum
spectra from $pp$, d+Au and Au+Au reactions -- show that pre-hadronic effects
are responsible for both the hardening of the hadron spectra for low transverse
momenta (Cronin effect) as well as the suppression of high $p_T$ hadrons. The
mutual interactions of formed hadrons are found to be negligible in central
Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV for $p_T \geq$ 6 GeV/c and the
sizeable suppression seen experimentally is attributed to a large extent to the
interactions of 'leading' pre-hadrons with the dense environment.

were suggested to be elementary building blocks that carry out key functions in
the network. It is of interest to understand how network motifs combine to form
larger structures. To address this, we present a systematic approach to define
'motif generalizations': families of motifs of different sizes that share a
common architectural theme. To define motif generalizations, we first define
'roles' in a subgraph according to structural equivalence. For example, the
feedforward loop triad, a motif in transcription, neuronal and some electronic
networks, has three roles, an input node, an output node and an internal node.
The roles are used to define possible generalizations of the motif. The
feedforward loop can have three simple generalizations, based on replicating
each of the three roles and their connections. We present algorithms for
efficiently detecting motif generalizations. We find that the transcription
networks of bacteria and yeast display only one of the three generalizations,
the multi-output feedforward generalization. In contrast, the neuronal network
of \emph{C. elegans} mainly displays the multi-input generalization.
Forward-logic electronic circuits display a multi-input, multi-output hybrid.
Thus, networks which share a common motif can have very different
generalizations of that motif. Using mathematical modelling, we describe the
information processing functions of the different motif generalizations in
transcription, neuronal and electronic networks.

B 74, 094411 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevB.74.094411",,"quant-ph cond-mat",,"  We consider the statics and dynamics of distinguishable spin-1/2 systems on
an arbitrary graph G with N vertices. In particular, we consider systems of
quantum spins evolving according to one of two hamiltonians: (i) the XY
hamiltonian H_XY, which contains an XY interaction for every pair of spins
connected by an edge in G; and (ii) the Heisenberg hamiltonian H_Heis, which
contains a Heisenberg interaction term for every pair of spins connected by an
edge in G. We find that the action of the XY (respectively, Heisenberg)
hamiltonian on state space is equivalent to the action of the adjacency matrix
(respectively, combinatorial laplacian) of a sequence G_k, k=0,..., N of graphs
derived from G (with G_1=G). This equivalence of actions demonstrates that the
dynamics of these two models is the same as the evolution of a free particle
hopping on the graphs G_k. Thus we show how to replace the complicated dynamics
of the original spin model with simpler dynamics on a more complicated
geometry. A simple corollary of our approach allows us to write an explicit
spectral decomposition of the XY model in a magnetic field on the path
consisting of N vertices. We also use our approach to utilise results from
spectral graph theory to solve new spin models: the XY model and heisenberg
model in a magnetic field on the complete graph.

a driven standing wave high-Q optical resonator. Even without any direct
atom-atom interaction the atoms are coupled through their position dependent
influence on the intracavity field. For sufficiently good trapping and low
cavity losses the atomic motion becomes significantly correlated and the two
particles oscillate in their wells preferentially with a 90 degrees relative
phase shift. The onset of correlations seriously limits cavity cooling
efficiency, raising the achievable temperature to the Doppler limit. The
physical origin of the correlation can be traced back to a cavity mediated
cross-friction, i.e. a friction force on one particle depending on the velocity
of the second particle. Choosing appropriate operating conditions allows for
engineering these long range correlations. In addition this cross-friction
effect can provide a basis for sympathetic cooling of distant trapped clouds.

space (Liouville space). It allows to use a quantum computer model with
four-valued logic. The gates of this model are general superoperators which act
on n-ququat state. Ququat is a quantum state in a four-dimensional (operator)
Hilbert space. Unitary two-valued logic gates and quantum operations for an

interferometer. The interference pattern obtained is not uniquely determined by
the completely positive maps (CPMs) that describe how the devices evolve the
internal state of a particle. By using the concept of gluing of CPMs, we
investigate the structure of all possible interference patterns obtainable for
given trace preserving internal state CPMs. We discuss what can be inferred
about the gluing, given a sufficiently rich set of interference experiments. It
is shown that the standard interferometric setup is limited in its abilities to
distinguish different gluings. A generalized interferometric setup is
introduced with the capacity to distinguish all gluings. We also connect to
another approach using the well known fact that channels can be realized using
a joint unitary evolution of the system and an ancillary system. We deduce the
set of all such unitary `representations' and relate the structure of this set
to gluings and interference phenomena.

Roche radius (3.6 R_Jup). Absorbing hydrogen atoms were found to be blueshifted
by up to -130 km/s, exceeding the planet escape velocity. This implies that
hydrogen atoms are escaping this ``hot Jupiter'' planet. An escape flux of >~
10^10g/s is needed to explain the observations. Taking into account the tidal
forces and the temperature rise expected in the upper atmosphere, theoretical
evaluations are in good agreement with the observed rate. Lifetime of planets
closer to their star could be shorter than stellar lifetimes suggesting that
this evaporating phenomenon may explain the lack of planets with very short

  This evaporating planet could be represented by the Egyptian God ``Osiris''

comprises three dwarf galaxies, NGC3077, NGC4214, and NGC5253, and one giant
spiral, NGC5236 (M83). The galaxies span a range in metallicity, luminosity,
and environment, enabling the investigation of non--radiative ionization
processes in a variety of galactic conditions. For this purpose, the four
galaxies were imaged in the lines of H-beta(4861 A), [OIII](5007 A),
H-alpha(6563 A), and [SII](6717,6731 A). The non--photoionized gas in these
galaxies has been traced on scales ranging from a few tens of pc to a few
hundred pc, providing a full budget for this ionized gas component. Using the
`maximum starburst line' of Kewley et al. (2001) to discriminate between
photoionized and non--photoionized gas, we find that in all four galaxies
non--photoionization processes are responsible for a small fraction of the
total H-alpha emission, at the level of 3%--4%. The starbursts in the three
dwarf galaxies deposit a significant fraction, 70%-100%, of their mechanical
energy into the surrounding interstellar medium and require time--extended (a
few x 10^7 yr to ~10^8 yr) star formation, in order to account for the observed
luminosity of the non--photoionized gas. In the massive spiral, the
non--photoionized gas is concentrated in localized areas surrounded by active
star--formation, with no evidence for extended structures (as those in the
dwarfs). This confirms the picture that starbursts remain confined events in
massive galaxies, likely due to the deep potential well.

leads to the correct extension of Saturn's cooling, and predicts an atmospheric
helium mass fraction Y_atmos in agreement with recent estimates. We then expand

discussed for two temperature accretion flows by Begelman & Chiueh. Lower
hybrid waves are generated by gyrating minor ions (mainly alpha-particles) and
become significant once strong ion cyclotron heating sets in beyond 1.5 R_sun.
In this way the model avoids conflict with SUMER electron temperature
diagnostic measurements between 1 and 1.5 R_sun. The principal requirement for
such a process to work is the existence of density gradients in the fast solar
wind, with scale length of similar order to the proton inertial length. Similar
size structures have previously been inferred by other authors from radio

in well formed bulges, possibly after a major merger. As they grow, they get
closer to the M-BH - sigma relation for normal galaxies. The accretion is
highest in the beginning and dwindles as the time goes by. Our result does not

constant fraction of the bulge mass/ velocity dispersion at all times or those

their low-frequency radio luminosities, and the optical core luminosity is
taken as an upper limit on the emission from any unobscured accretion disc. We
argue that if the accretion discs in these sources are assumed to be advection
dominated accretion flows (ADAFs), or adiabatic inflow-outflow solution (ADIOS)
flows, then the Blandford-Znajek mechanism (Blandford & Znajek 1977) provides
insufficient power to explain the high radio luminosities of at least a third,
and perhaps all, of the sample. We suggest instead that a significant fraction
(the 'high-jet-power' third), and perhaps most, of the 3CR FR I radio galaxies
have normal accretion discs, but that their optical cores can be hidden, with
any HST-detected optical synchrotron emission coming from jets on scales larger
than the obscuring material. A normal accretion disc hypothesis, at least for
the high-jet-power third of the 3CR FR Is, explains why narrow-line luminosity
correlates with radio luminosity. It also explains why one object in the sample

absorption features suggest that these most distant quasars are surrounded by a
much larger amount of dense gas than lower redshift (z<4) quasars. The possible
interpretation in terms of extremely high accretion rates and the association
with the early formation of quasars and of their host galaxies is discussed.
The absorption properties of the dust, associated with the gas along the line
of sight, appear different with respect to lower redshift quasars, possibly
indicating different dust physics at these highest redshifts.

part) due to the superposition of flares, using an analytic approach to
determine the amplitude distribution of flares in light curves. The
flare-heating hypothesis is motivated by time series that show continuous
variability suggesting the presence of a large number of superimposed flares
with similar rise and decay time scales. We rigorously relate the amplitude
distribution of stellar flares to the observed histograms of binned counts and
photon waiting times, under the assumption that the flares occur at random and
have similar shapes. Applying these results to EUVE/DS observations of the
flaring star AD Leo, we find that the flare amplitude distribution can be
represented by a truncated power law with a power law index of 2.3 +/- 0.1. Our
analytical results agree with existing Monte Carlo results of Kashyap et al.

further stochastically bursting astrophysical sources such as cataclysmic
variables, Gamma Ray Burst substructures, X-ray binaries, and spatially

in the orbital plane of cataclysmic variables (CVs). Our motivation stems from
the fact that the strong braking exerted by a circumbinary (CB) disc on the

evolution. Since theoretical estimates predict that the emission from a CB disc
can dominate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the system at
wavelengths > 5 microns, we obtained simultaneous visible to mid-IR SEDs for
eight systems. We report detections of SS Cyg at 11.7 microns and AE Aqr at
17.6 microns, both in excess of the contribution from the secondary star. In AE
Aqr, the IR likely originates from synchrotron-emitting clouds propelled by the
white dwarf. In SS Cyg, we argue that the observed mid-IR variability is
difficult to reconcile with simple models of CB discs and we consider free-free
emission from a wind. In the other systems, our mid-IR upper limits place
strong constraints on the maximum temperature of a putative CB disc. The
results show that if any sizeable CB disc are present in these systems, they
must be self-shadowed or perhaps dust-free, with the peak thermal emission

relevant because the galaxy formation process consists not only of the
accumulation of gas in a gravitational potential well, but also of the
triggering of star formation in this gas mass and also because some high-z
potentially primeval galaxy blocks look like nearby star-forming dwarf
galaxies. We review theoretical ideas proposed to account for the tidal
interaction triggering mechanism and present a series of observational tests of
this assumption using published data. We show also results of a search in the
vicinity of a composite sample of 96 dwarf late-type galaxies for interaction
candidates showing star formation. The small number of possible perturbing
galaxies indentified in the neighborhood of our sample galaxies, along with
similar findings from other studies, supports the view that tidal interactions
may not be relevant as primary triggers of star formation. We conclude that
interactions between galaxies may explain some forms of star formation
triggering, perhaps in central regions of large galaxies, but they do not seem
to be significant for dwarf galaxies and, by inference, for first-time galaxies
forming at high redshifts. Intuitive reasoning, based on an analogy with
stellar dynamics, shows that conditions for primary star formation triggering
may occur in gas masses oscillating in a dark matter potential. We propose this
mechanism as a plausible primary trigger scenario, worth investigating

a quasi-equilibrium configuration characterized by isotropic, quasi-Maxwellian

hysteresis. The second part is devoted to the local pinning picture and its

founded, generalizes stable model semantics for normal (i.e. non disjunctive)
programs but differs from disjunctive stable model semantics (the extension of
stable model semantics for disjunctive programs). Compared with disjunctive
stable model semantics, minimal founded semantics seems to be more intuitive,
it gives meaning to programs which are meaningless under stable model semantics
and is no harder to compute. More specifically, minimal founded semantics
differs from stable model semantics only for disjunctive programs having
constraint rules or rules working as constraints. We study the expressive power
of the semantics and show that for general disjunctive datalog programs it has
the same power as disjunctive stable model semantics.

without considering the whole program. Lifschitz, Pearce and Valverde showed
that Heyting's logic of here-and-there can be used to characterize strong
equivalence for logic programs with nested expressions (which subsume the
better-known extended disjunctive programs). This note considers a simpler,
more direct characterization of strong equivalence for such programs, and shows
that it can also be applied without modification to the weight constraint
programs of Niemela and Simons. Thus, this characterization of strong
equivalence is convenient for the study of equivalent transformations of logic

used to automate reasoning about strong equivalence, including a novel encoding

confirmed numerically only in the SU(2) case with center Z(2), simply because
all SU(N) Yang-Mills theories with N>=3 seem to have non-universal first order
phase transitions. The symplectic groups Sp(N) also have the center Z(2) and
provide another extension of SU(2) = Sp(1) to general N. Using lattice
simulations, we find that the deconfinement phase transition of Sp(2)
Yang-Mills theory is first order in 3+1 dimensions, while in 2+1 dimensions
stronger fluctuations induce a second order transition. In agreement with the
Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture, for (2+1)-d Sp(2) Yang-Mills theory we find the
universal critical behavior of the 2-d Ising model. For Sp(3) Yang-Mills theory
the transition is first order both in 2+1 and in 3+1 dimensions. This suggests
that the size of the gauge group -- and not the center symmetry -- determines
the order of the deconfinement phase transition.

critical phenomena is studied by obtaining the equations of motion for pion

excitations with dispersion relation $\omega_{\pi}(k)=k$ described by isolated
pion poles. The residue of the pion pole vanishes near $T_c$ as $Z \propto

damping on a time scale $t_\mathrm{rel}(k)\propto 1/k$, reflecting
\emph{critical slowing down} of pion fluctuations near the critical point. At
the critical point, the pion propagator features mass shell logarithmic
divergences which we conjecture to be the harbinger of a (large) dynamical
anomalous dimension. We find that while the \emph{classical spinodal} line
coincides with that of the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the growth rate of
long-wavelength spinodal fluctuations has a richer wavelength dependence as a
consequence of Landau damping. We argue that Landau damping prevents a
\emph{local} low energy effective action in terms of a derivative expansion in

via rigid-rotor collective quantization of SU(3) chiral soliton models. This
paper explores the validity of this treatment. A number of rather general
analyses suggest that predictions of exotic baryon properties based on this
approximation do not follow from large Nc QCD. These include an analysis of the
baryon's width, a comparison of the predictions with general large Nc
consistency conditions of the Gervais-Sakita-Dashen-Manohar type; an
application of the technique to QCD in the limit where the quarks are heavy; a
comparison of this method with the vibration approach of Callan and Klebanov;
and the 1/Nc scaling of the excitation energy. It is suggested that the origin
of the problem lies in an implicit assumption in the that the collective motion
is orthogonal to vibrational motion. While true for non-exotic motion, the
Wess-Zumino term induces mixing at leading order between collective and
vibrational motion with exotic quantum numbers. This suggests that successful
phenomenological predictions of theta+ properties based on rigid-rotor
quantization were accidental.

lies between 5 $\times 10^6$ GeV and 5 $\times 10^8$ GeV. In this class of
theories, which includes models of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking, the
lightest supersymmetric particle is the gravitino. The next to lightest
supersymmetric particle is typically a long lived charged slepton with a
lifetime between a microsecond and a second, depending on its mass. Collisions
of high energy neutrinos with nucleons in the earth can result in the
production of a pair of these sleptons. Their very high boost means they
typically decay outside the earth. We investigate the production of these
particles by the diffuse flux of high energy neutrinos, and the potential for
their observation in large ice or water Cerenkov detectors. The relatively
small cross-section for the production of supersymmetric particles is partially
compensated for by the very long range of heavy particles. The signal in the
detector consists of two parallel charged tracks emerging from the earth about
100 meters apart, with very little background. A detailed calculation using the
Waxman-Bahcall limit on the neutrino flux and realistic spectra shows that
km$^3$ experiments could see as many as 4 events a year. We conclude that
neutrino telescopes will complement collider searches in the determination of
the supersymmetry breaking scale, and may even give the first evidence for
supersymmetry at the weak scale.

circle is derived and studied. It is found that a point mass located at one
side of the circle can generate almost the same strength of gravitational force
at the other side. Combined with the brane-world scenarios, it means that
although one can not see a particle which is confined to another brane, one can
feel its gravity explicitly as if it were located on our brane. This leads to
the conclusion that matter on all branes may contribute equally to the
curvature of our brane. Therefore, dark matter is probably nothing unusual but
a `shadow' cast on our brane by hidden ordinary matter of other branes. It is
shown that the physical effect of this `shadow' could be modeled by a perfect
fluid with an effective mass density and a non-zero pressure. This fluid could
serve as a dark matter candidate with an equation of state p_{eff}=omega rho
_{eff} where omega is a positive r-dependent function and \omega \neq 0,1/3,\
implying that it is neither cold nor hot. So, if the higher-dimensional
universe contains several branes, the total amount of hidden matter would be
able to provide the required amount for dark matter. Meanwhile, dark matter
halos of galaxies might be just halos of the effective mass distribution
yielded by hidden ordinary stars, and these stars are confined on other branes
but captured by our galaxies. Some more properties and implications are also
discussed.

Within their framework it was shown that even in 5D non-compact Minkowski space

introducing a brane-localized 4D Einstein-Hilbert term
$\delta(z)M_4^2\sqrt{|\bar{g}_4|}\bar{R}_4$ in the action. Based on this idea,
we construct simple setups in which graviton standing waves can arise, and we
introduce brane-localized $z$ derivative terms as a correction to
$\delta(z)M_4^2\sqrt{|\bar{g}_4|}\bar{R}_4$. We show that the gravity potential
of brane matter becomes $-\frac{1}{r}$ at {\it long} distances, because the
brane-localized $z$ derivative terms allow only a smooth graviton wave function
near the brane. Since the bulk gravity coupling may be arbitrarily small,
strongly interacting modes from the 5D graviton do not appear. We note that the
brane metric utilized to construct $\delta(z)M_4^2\sqrt{|\bar{g}_4|}\bar{R}_4$
can be relatively different from the bulk metric by a conformal factor, and
show that the graviton tensor structure that the 4D Einstein gravity predicts
are reproduced in DGP type models.

multi-loop superstring amplitudes are exposed. Correct calculations are given.
It is shown that the cardinal mistake in the gauge fixing procedure presents ab
ovo in the Verlinde papers. The mistake was reproduced in following proposals
including the recent papers. The modular symmetry of the multi-loop superstring
amplitudes is clarified, an incorrectness of previous conjectures being shown.
It is shown that the Berezin-type integral versus boson and fermion moduli is
doubt under non-split transformations mixing fermion integration variables to
the boson integration ones. In particular, due to singularities in moduli of
the given spin structure, the integral can be finite or divergent dependently
on the integration variables employed. Hence, unlike naive expectations, the
multi-loop superstring amplitude is ambiguous. Nevertheless, the ambiguity is
totally resolved by the requirement to preserve local symmetries of the
superstring amplitude. In the Verlinde world-sheet description it includes,
among other thing, the requirement that the amplitude is independent of the
gravitino field locations. In action the resolution of the ambiguity in the
Verlinde scheme is achieved by going to the supercovariant gauge. As it has
been argued earlier, the resulted arbitrary-loop amplitudes are finite.

group, namely the asymptotic symmetry group of any asymptotically flat
space-time. We continue this investigation in this paper. Having in mind a
S-matrix approach with future and past null infinity playing the role of
holographic screens on which the BMS group acts, we connect the IR sectors of
the gravitational field with the representation theory of the BMS group. We
analyze the (complicated) mapping between bulk and boundary symmetries pointing
out differences with respect to the AdS/CFT set up. Finally we construct a BMS
phase space and a free hamiltonian for fields transforming w.r.t BMS
representations. The last step is supposed to be an explorative investigation
of the boundary data living on the degenerate null manifold at infinity.

differencing schemes, the path integral based algorithm has no artificial
numerical dispersion (dispersive errors), operates at the Nyquist limit (two
grid points per shortest wavelength in the wavepacket) and exhibits an
exponential convergence as the grid size increases, which, in turn, should lead
to a higher accuracy. The Gauss law holds exactly with no extra computational
cost. Each time step requires $O(N\log_2 N)$ elementary operations where $N$ is
the grid size. It can also be applied to simulations of electromagnetic waves
in passive media whose properties are time dependent when conventional
stationary (scattering matrix) methods are inapplicable. The stability and

the bindweed model, evolving in a random environment on an infinite multiplexed

nearest neighbours random walk on a tree whose vertices carry an internal
degree of freedom from the finite set $\{1,...,d\}$, for some integer $d$. The
consequence of the internal degree of freedom is an enhancement of the tree
graph structure induced by the replacement of ordinary edges by multi-edges,
indexed by the set $\{1,...,d\}\times\{1,...,d\}$. This indexing conveys the
information on the internal degree of freedom of the vertices contiguous to
each edge. The term \textit{random environment} means that the jumping rates
for the random walk are a family of edge-indexed random variables, independent
of the natural filtration generated by the random variables entering in the
definition of the random walk; their joint distribution depends on the index of
each component of the multi-edges. We study the large time asymptotic behaviour
of this random walk and classify it with respect to positive recurrence or
transience in terms of a specific parameter of the probability distribution of
the jump rates. This classifying parameter is shown to coincide with the
critical value of a matrix-valued multiplicative cascade on the ordinary tree
(\textit{i.e.} the one without internal degrees of freedom attached to the
vertices) having the same vertex set as the state space of the random walk.
Only results are presented here since the detailed proofs will appear

There exists a time-scale $\tau_H$ for helicity transfer in homogeneous,

phenomenological arguments used by Kraichnan to derive the timescale $\tau_E$
for energy transfer (J. Fluid Mech. {\bf 47}, 525--535 (1971)). We show that in
general $\tau_H$ may not be neglected compared to $\tau_E$, even for rather low
relative helicity. We then deduce an inertial range joint cascade of energy and
helicity in which the dynamics are dominated by $\tau_E$ in the low wavenumbers
with both energy and helicity spectra scaling as $k^{-5/3}$; and by $\tau_H$ at
larger wavenumbers with spectra scaling as $k^{-4/3}$. We demonstrate how,
within this phenomenology, the commonly observed ``bottleneck'' in the energy
spectrum might be explained. We derive a wavenumber $k_h$ which is less than
the Kolmogorov dissipation wavenumber, at which both energy and helicity
cascades terminate due to dissipation effects. Data from direct numerical
simulations are used to check our predictions.

momentum-dependence but corresponding to the same density-dependent symmetry
energy $E_{sym}(\rho)$ lead to significantly different predictions on several
$E_{sym}(\rho)$-sensitive experimental observables especially for energetic
nucleons. The momentum- and density-dependence of the symmetry potential have
to be determined simultaneously in order to extract the $E_{sym}(\rho)$
accurately. The isospin asymmetry of midrapidity nucleons at high transverse
momenta is particularly sensitive to the momentum-dependence of the symmetry
potential. It is thus very useful for investigating accurately the equation of
state of dense neutron-rich matter.

The additional constraint from the neutron matter equation of state leads
however to a somewhat too low saturation density of $\rho_0 =0.134 \fmd$. We
also investigate the effects of the NN-contact interaction on the complex

transition at somewhat too high values $T_c \geq 21 $MeV. The downward bending
of the asymmetry energy $A(k_f)$ above nuclear matter saturation density is a
generic feature of the approximation to fourth order. Altogether, there is

switching behavior of a model circuit of multisite phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation with feedback. The circuit consists of a kinase and
phosphatase acting on multiple sites of a substrate that, contingent on its
modification state, catalyzes its own phosphorylation and, in a symmetric
scenario, dephosphorylation. The symmetric case is viewed as a cartoon of
conflicting feedback that could result from antagonistic pathways impinging on
the state of a shared component.
  Results: Multisite phosphorylation is sufficient for bistable behavior under
feedback even when catalysis is linear in substrate concentration, which is the
case we consider. We compute the phase diagram, fluctuation spectrum and
large-deviation properties related to switch memory within a statistical
mechanics framework. Bistability occurs as either a first-order or second-order
non-equilibrium phase transition, depending on the network symmetries and the
ratio of phosphatase to kinase numbers. In the second-order case, the circuit
never leaves the bistable regime upon increasing the number of substrate
molecules at constant kinase to phosphatase ratio.
  Conclusions: The number of substrate molecules is a key parameter controlling
both the onset of the bistable regime, fluctuation intensity, and the residence
time in a switched state. The relevance of the concept of memory depends on the
degree of switch symmetry, as memory presupposes information to be remembered,
which is highest for equal residence times in the switched states.

The particular way of deriving the solution allows a rigorous derivation of a
long wavelength approximation. This long wavelength approximation is useful as
it provides an approximate analytical expression that captures the basics of
the quantum walk and allows us to gain insight into the physics of the process.

interpretation of quantum mechanics. Here I argue that the Everettian can have
everything she needs from `probability' without recourse to indeterminism,
ignorance, primitive identity over time or subjective uncertainty: all she
needs is a particular *rationality principle*.
  The decision-theoretic approach recently developed by Deutsch and Wallace
claims to provide just such a principle. But, according to Wallace, decision
theory is itself applicable only if the correct attitude to a future Everettian
measurement outcome is subjective uncertainty. I argue that subjective
uncertainty is not to be had, but I offer an alternative interpretation that
enables the Everettian to live without uncertainty: we can justify Everettian
decision theory on the basis that an Everettian should *care about* all her
future branches. The probabilities appearing in the decision-theoretic
representation theorem can then be interpreted as the degrees to which the
rational agent cares about each future branch. This reinterpretation, however,
reduces the intuitive plausibility of one of the Deutsch-Wallace axioms
(Measurement Neutrality).

measuring spin-induced attonewton forces using a micromachined cantilever. In
the interrupted Oscillating Cantilever-driven Adiabatic Reversal (iOSCAR)
method, small ensembles of electron spins are manipulated by an external radio
frequency (RF) magnetic field to produce small periodic deviations in the
resonant frequency of the cantilever. These deviations can be detected by
frequency demodulation, followed by conventional amplitude or energy detection.
In this paper, we develop optimal detectors for several signal models that have
been hypothesized for measurements induced by iOSCAR spin manipulation. We show
that two simple variants of the energy detector--the filtered energy detector
and a hybrid filtered energy/amplitude/energy detector--are approximately
asymptotically optimal for the Discrete-Time (D-T) random telegraph signal
model assuming White Gaussian Noise (WGN). For the D-T random walk signal
model, the filtered energy detector performs close to the optimal Likelihood
Ratio Test (LRT) when the transition probabilities are symmetric.

size. The Born-Markov approximation is employed to derive a master equation in
the regime of small coupling strengths to the environment. For spin one half,
the master equation transforms into a set of Bloch equations, the solution of
which is in good agreement with results of the spin-boson model for weak ohmic
dissipation. For larger spins, we find a superradiance-like behavior known from
the Dicke model. The influence of the nonresonant bosons of the dissipative
environment can lead to the formation of a beat pattern in the dynamics of the
$z$-component of the spin. The beat frequency is approximately proportional to
the cutoff $\omega_c$ of the spectral function.

We show that the problem of maximising the fidelity of the quantum
communication is related to a classical problem in fourier wave analysis. By
making use of this observation we find that if both communicating parties have
access to limited numbers of qubits in the ring (a fraction that vanishes in
the limit of large rings) it is possible to make the communication arbitrarily
good.

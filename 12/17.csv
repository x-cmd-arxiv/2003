speed of clusters of galaxies at different redshifts. This statistic is
evaluated by cross-correlating cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations
caused by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from observed clusters of galaxies with
their redshifts. When clusters are distributed in redshift bins of narrow
width, one could measure the mean squared cluster peculiar velocity with an
error \sigma_{C_S^2}\lsim (300{\rm km/s})^2. This can be done around z>0.3 with
clusters of flux above 200 mJy which will be detected by PLANCK, coupled with
high resolution microwave images to eliminate the cosmological part of the CMB
fluctuations. The latter can be achieved with observations by the planned ALMA
array or the NSF South Pole telescope and other surveys. By measuring the
cosmic sound speed and the bulk flow in, e.g., 4 spheres of ~ 100h^{-1}Mpc at
z=0.3, we could have a direct measurement of the matter density

large number of two-point correlation observables: galaxy-galaxy angular
correlations, galaxy-shear cross correlations, and shear-shear correlations
between all redshifts. These observables can potentially enable a joint
determination of the dark energy dependent evolution of the dark matter and
distances as well as the relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos.
With recent CMB determinations of the initial power spectrum, a measurement of
the mass clustering at even a_single_ redshift will constrain a well-specified
combination of dark energy parameters in a flat universe; we provide convenient
fitting formulae for such studies. The combination of galaxy-shear and
galaxy-galaxy correlations can determine this amplitude at_multiple_ redshifts.
We illustrate this ability in a description of the galaxy clustering with 5
free functions of redshift which can be fitted from the data. The galaxy
modeling is based on a mapping onto halos of the same abundance that models a
flux-limited selection. In this context, a 4000 deg2 galaxy-lensing survey can
achieve a_statistical_ precision of sigma(Omega_DE)=0.005 for the dark energy
density, sigma(w_DE)=0.02 and sigma(w_a)=0.17 for its equation of state and
evolution, evaluated at dark energy matter equality z~0.4, as well as
constraints on the 5 halo functions out to z=1. More importantly, a joint
analysis can make dark energy constraints robust against systematic errors in
the shear-shear correlation and halo modeling.

between bright and faint states, as observed today. However, the bright state
was 0.9 mag brighter than the modern value, and the fractional variation
between bright and faint states (Delta I = 0.7 mag) was smaller than observed
today (3.5 mag). A possible explanation for these findings is that the system
contains a second star that was previously blended with the eclipsing star, but
is now completely obscured.

first quasar lensed by a cluster of galaxies. It consists of four images with a
maximum separation of 14.62''. The system has been confirmed as a lensed quasar
at z=1.734 on the basis of deep imaging and spectroscopic follow-up
observations. We present color-magnitude relations for galaxies near the lens
plus spectroscopy of three central cluster members, which unambiguously confirm
that a cluster at z=0.68 is responsible for the large image separation. We find
a wide range of lens models consistent with the data, but they suggest four
general conclusions: (1) the brightest cluster galaxy and the center of the
cluster potential well appear to be offset by several kpc; (2) the cluster mass
distribution must be elongated in the North--South direction, which is
consistent with the observed distribution of cluster galaxies; (3) the
inference of a large tidal shear (~0.2) suggests significant substructure in
the cluster; and (4) enormous uncertainty in the predicted time delays between
the images means that measuring the delays would greatly improve constraints on
the models. We also compute the probability of such large separation lensing in
the SDSS quasar sample, on the basis of the CDM model. The lack of large
separation lenses in previous surveys and the discovery of one in SDSS together
imply a mass fluctuation normalization \sigma_8=1.0^{+0.4}_{-0.2} (95% CL), if
cluster dark matter halos have an inner slope -1.5. Shallower profiles would
require higher values of \sigma_8. Although the statistical conclusion might be
somewhat dependent on the degree of the complexity of the lens potential, the
discovery is consistent with the predictions of the abundance of cluster-scale
halos in the CDM scenario. (Abridged)

experiencing active bulge growth within disks, using the criterion that the
color within the half-light radius is bluer than the outer disk color. Such
blue-centered galaxies make up >10% of star-forming disk galaxies within the
Nearby Field Galaxy Survey, a broad survey designed to represent the natural
diversity of the low-z galaxy population over a wide range of luminosities and
environments. Blue-centered galaxies correlate at 99% confidence with
morphological peculiarities suggestive of minor mergers and interactions. From
this and other evidence, we argue that external drivers rather than internal
secular processes probably account for the majority of blue-centered galaxies.
We go on to discuss quantitative plausibility arguments indicating that
blue-centered evolutionary phases may represent an important mode of bulge
growth for most disk galaxies, leading to significant changes in bulge-to-disk
ratio without destroying disks. If this view is correct, bulge growth within
disks may be a natural consequence of the repeated galaxy mergers and
interactions inherent in hierarchical galaxy formation.

V(x^i,t)=[1+m_0 sin(omega t) V_0(x^i), divide naturally into two types, regular
and chaotic, between which transitions are seemingly impossible. The chaotic
orbits divide in turn into two types, apparently separated by entropy barriers,
namely `sticky' orbit segments, which are `locked' to the driving frequency and
exhibit little systematic energy diffusion, and `wildly' chaotic segments,
which are not so locked and can exhibit significant energy diffusion. Attention
focuses on how the relative abundance of these different orbit types and the
transition rate between sticky and wildly chaotic orbits depends on amplitude
m_0, and on the extent to which these quantities can be altered by weak
friction and/or noise and by pseudo-random variations in the driving frequency,
idealized as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with (in general) nonzero
autocorrelation time t_c. When, in the absence of perturbations, there exist
large measures of both regular and chaotic orbits, the primary effect of weak
noise is to increase the relative measure of chaotic orbits. Alternatively,
when almost all the orbits are already chaotic, noise serves primarily to
accelerate transitions from sticky to wildly chaotic behavior. The presence or
absence of friction is unimportant and the details of the noise seem largely
immaterial. In particular, there is only a weak, roughly logarithmic dependence
on amplitude, and additive and multiplicative noise typically have virtually
identical effects. By contrast, allowing for high frequency `noisy' variations
in omega tends to weaken effects of the driving, decreasing the relative
measure of chaotic orbits and suppressing large scale energy diffusion.

that large-scale structure shocks occur at a fixed overdensity during nonlinear
collapse. This in turn allows us to compute the fraction of gas at a given
redshift that has been shock-heated to a specified temperature. We show that,
if strong shocks occur at turnaround, our model provides a reasonable
description of the temperature distribution seen in cosmological simulations at
z~0, although it does overestimate the importance of weak shocks. We then apply
our model to shocks at high redshifts. We show that, before reionization, the
thermal energy of the IGM is dominated by large-scale structure shocks (rather
than virialized objects). These shocks can have a variety of effects, including
stripping ~10% of the gas from dark matter minihalos, accelerating cosmic rays,
and creating a diffuse radiation background from inverse Compton and cooling
radiation. This radiation background develops before the first stars form and
could have measurable effects on molecular hydrogen formation and the spin
temperature of the 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen. Finally, we show that
shock-heating will also be directly detectable by redshifted 21 cm measurements

high-mass stars form in the dense cores of interstellar molecular clouds; gas

observe the power spectrum of the EOR using relatively short observations, and

LOFAR for simple models of the high redshift 21cm emission. The challenge of
residual foreground removal may be addressed by the symmetries in the

most classes of residual un-subtracted foreground contamination, including all
foreground continuum sources and radio line emission from the Milky Way.

objective is to examine how the composition of the bilayers affects their

varying the mole fraction of DMTAP, we have found that the area per lipid has a
pronounced non-monotonic dependence on the DMTAP concentration, with a minimum
around the point of equimolar mixture. We show that this behavior has an
electrostatic origin and is driven by the interplay between positively charged
TAP headgroups and the zwitterionic PC heads. This interplay leads to
considerable re-orientation of PC headgroups for an increasing DMTAP
concentration, and gives rise to major changes in the electrostatic properties
of the lipid bilayer, including a significant increase of total dipole
potential across the bilayer and prominent changes in the ordering of water in
the vicinity of the membrane. Moreover, chloride counter-ions are bound mostly
to PC nitrogens implying stronger screening of PC heads by Cl ions compared to
TAP head groups. The implications of these findings are briefly discussed.

interactions with a constant tension or stiffness. A nonlocal elastic kernel
results as a consequence of long range interactions between dislocations. In
light of this result, we revise statistical depinning theories and find novel

low dimensional chaotic state at medium strain rates to an infinite dimensional
power law state of stress drops at high strain rates. We present results of an
extensive study of all aspects of the PLC effect within the context a model
that reproduces this crossover. A study of the distribution of the Lyapunov
exponents as a function of strain rate shows that it changes from a small set
of positive exponents in the chaotic regime to a dense set of null exponents in
the scaling regime. As the latter feature is similar to the GOY shell model for
turbulence, we compare our results with the GOY model. Interestingly, the null
exponents in our model themselves obey a power law. The configuration of
dislocations is visualized through the slow manifold analysis. This shows that
while a large proportion of dislocations are in the pinned state in the chaotic
regime, most of them are at the threshold of unpinning in the scaling regime.
The model qualitatively reproduces the different types of deformation bands
seen in experiments. At high strain rates where propagating bands are seen, the
model equations are reduced to the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation for propagative
fronts. This shows that the velocity of the bands varies linearly with the
strain rate and inversely with the dislocation density, consistent with the
known experimental results. Thus, this simple dynamical model captures the
complex spatio-temporal features of the PLC effect.

of pure phases and miscibility gaps as for pure La2NiO4+d. We find a weak Sr
doping dependence of the d-range for the pure LTO, LTT and HTT phases; but
overall, the d-ranges of the different phases do not vary strongly for x<=0.06.
Drastic changes are observed for x=0.08 and 0.12, where miscibility gaps
successively disappear. For x=0.12 all oxygen doped samples are in the HTT
phase. The mechanism responsible for the suppression of the phase separation
seems to involves multiple factors, including the Coulomb interaction between
Sr impurities and interstitial oxygens as well as the reduction of the NiO6
octahedral tilt angle. The doping dependence of the lattice parameters shows
clear differences for pure Sr and pure O doping. With the exception of the LTO
phase, the in-plane lattice parameters explicitly depend on the type of dopant,
rather than the net hole content, p=x+2d. In contrast, the orthorhombic strain
in the LTO phase as well as the c-axis length appears to depend only on p;
however, in the case of the c-axis length this ''universal'' behavior turns out
to be accidental. Our results also show that the chemical pressure of La-site
dopants is highly anisotropic, whereas that of O interstitials appears to be
more isotropic. In general, this study reveals that Sr-doped samples have to be
annealed carefully to achieve d=0, and to permit the study of the intrinsic

autonomous first-order partial differential equations. We study the system
numerically, and we find that there always exists an initial singularity, which
is characterized by the fact that spatial derivatives are dynamically
negligible. More importantly, from the numerical analysis we conclude that
there is an initial isotropic singularity in all of these spatially
inhomogeneous brane cosmologies for a range of parameter values which include
the physically important cases of radiation and a scalar field source. The
numerical results are supported by a qualitative dynamical analysis and a
calculation of the past asymptotic decay rates. Although the analysis is local
in nature, the numerics indicates that the singularity is isotropic for all
relevant initial conditions. Therefore this analysis, and a preliminary
investigation of general inhomogeneous ($G_0$) models, indicates that it is

turns out that the inflation due to the bulk inflaton successfully takes place.

fixing the lapse function in the path integral of gravity, we get a
Schroedinger quantum dynamics, of which eigenvalues problem provides the

state formed from 6 top and 6 anti-top quarks, held together mainly by Higgs
particle exchange, is so strongly bound that it can become tachyonic and
condense in one of the three suggested vacua. If we live in this vacuum, the
new bound state would be seen via its mixing with the Higgs particle. It would
have essentially the same decay branching ratios as a Higgs particle of the

spacetime foam. The strength of the foam is characterized by the factor
(E/M_P)^a, where ``a'' is a phenomenological suppression parameter. We find
that there exists a critical value of ``a'' (dependent on the particular
reaction), below which the threshold energy can only be lowered, and above
which the threshold energy may be raised, but at most by a factor of two. Thus,
it does not appear possible in this class of models to extend cosmic-ray
spectra significantly beyond their classical absorption energies. However, the
lower thresholds resulting from foam may have signatures in the cosmic-ray
spectrum. We also find that cosmic-ray energies cannot exceed the fundamental
Planck scale, and so set a lower bound of 10^8 TeV on the context of this model

relevant for the decay B -> X_s gamma, are discussed in supersymmetric models
at large tan beta. These contributions receive two-loop O(alpha_s tan beta)
corrections by squark-gluino subloops, which are possibly large and
nondecoupling in the limit of heavy superpartners. In previous studies, the
relevant two-loop Feynman integrals were approximated by using an effective
two-Higgs-doublet lagrangian. However, this approximation is theoretically
justified only when the typical supersymmetric scale M_SUSY is sufficiently
larger than the electroweak scale m_weak \sim (m_W,m_t) and the mass of the
charged-Higgs boson m_{H^\pm}. Here we evaluate these two-loop integrals
exactly and compare the results with the existing, approximated ones. We then
examine the validity of this approximation beyond the region where it has been
derived, i.e. for m_H \gtap M_SUSY and/or M_SUSY \sim m_weak.

similar operator expansion to that which determines the Yukawa operators.
Therefore in models based on family symmetry canonical re-normalisation is
mandatory before the physical Yukawa matrices can be extracted. In nearly all
examples in the literature this is not done. As an example we perform an
explicit calculation of such mixing associated with canonical normalisation of
the Kahler metric in a supersymmetric model based on SU(3) family symmetry,
where we show that such effects can significantly change the form of the Yukawa
matrix. In principle quark mixing could originate entirely from canonical
normalisation, with only diagonal Yukawa couplings before canonical
normalisation.

duality, which relates the physics at temperature T to the physics at inverse

towards dealing with this issue. One approach yields a ""bootstrap"" method of
extracting possible exact, closed-form solutions for finite-temperature
effective potentials in string theory. Another approach involves extending the
usual definition of entropy by introducing additional terms which are
suppressed by powers of the string scale. At high temperatures, however, these
string corrections become significant and lead to a variety of surprising new
phenomena as the temperature is increased.

reducing to D=3 where the bosonic part of the theory becomes a sigma model on
E_{8(8)}/SO(16), solving the equations through an algorithm that produces
general integrals for any chosen regular subalgebra G_r of E_{8(8)} and then
oxiding back to D=10. Different oxidations and hence different physical
interpretations of the same solutions are associated with different embeddings
of G_r. We show how such embeddings constitute orbits under the Weyl group and
we study the orbit space. This is relevant to associate candidate superstring
cosmological backgrounds to space Dp-brane configurations that admit
microscopic descriptions. In particular in this paper we show that there is
just one Weyl orbit of A_r subalgebras for r < 6$. The orbit of the previously
found A_2 solutions, together with space--brane representatives contains a pure
metric representative that corresponds to homogeneous Bianchi type 2A

horizontal family of cycles in the curves $\{H=t\}$, and $\omega$ a polynomial

multiplicity of $I(t)$, away from the critical values of $H$. Namely: $ord\
I(t) \leq n-1+\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ if $\deg \omega <\deg H=n+1$. The reasoning
goes as follows: we consider the analytic curve parameterized by the integrals
along $\delta(t)$ of the $n$ ``Petrov'' forms of $H$ (polynomial 1-forms that
freely generate the module of relative cohomology of $H$), and interpret the
multiplicity of $I(t)$ as the order of contact of $\gamma(t)$ and a linear
hyperplane of $\textbf C^ n$. Using the Picard-Fuchs system satisfied by
$\gamma(t)$, we establish an algebraic identity involving the wronskian
determinant of the integrals of the original form $\omega$ along a basis of the
homology of the generic fiber of $H$. The latter wronskian is analyzed through
this identity, which yields the estimate on the multiplicity of $I(t)$. Still,
in some cases, related to the geometry at infinity of the curves $\{H=t\}
\subseteq \textbf C^2$, the wronskian occurs to be zero identically. In this
alternative we show how to adapt the argument to a system of smaller rank, and
get a nontrivial wronskian. For a form $\omega$ of arbitrary degree, we are led
to estimating the order of contact between $\gamma(t)$ and a suitable algebraic
hypersurface in $\textbf C^{n+1}$. We observe that $ord I(t)$ grows like an

variety by Ishii and Kollar's paper which also shows the negative answer for
general case. The Nash problem is one of questions about the relation between
arc families and valuations. In this paper, the relation is described clearly
for a toric variety. The arc space of a toric variety admits an action of the
group scheme determined by the torus. Each orbit on the arc space corresponds
to a lattice point in the cone and therefore corresponds to a toric valuation.
The dominant relation among the orbits is described in terms of the lattice
points. As a corollary we obtain the answer to the embedded version of the Nash
problem for an invariant ideal on a toric variety.

problem of a proper action. In virtue of incompressibility, the integration
over transverse components of the fields allows to cast the action in the form
of a large deviation functional. Since the hydrodynamic operator is nonlinear,
the functional integral yielding the statistics of fluctuations can be
practically computed by linearizing around a physical solution of the
hydrodynamic equation. We show that this procedure yields the dimensional
scaling predicted by K41 theory at the lowest perturbative order, where the
perturbation parameter is the inverse Reynolds number. This result is valid
over a finite spatio-temporal domain, where the physical solution can be
considered as stationary.

Anticipation Criterion. We formulate these two principles and describe some of
their consequences in relation to stopping rules, conditioning, and nuisance
parameters. The discussion is illustrated with examples taken from high-energy
physics.

reflection gratings made of dispersive (Drude metals) and dielectric materials
is studied by a time-domain numerical algorithm for Maxwell's theory of linear
passive (dispersive and absorbing) media. The algorithm is based on the
Hamiltonian formalism in the framework of which Maxwell's equations for passive
media are shown to be equivalent to the first-order equation, $\partial
\Psi/\partial t = {\cal H}\Psi$, where ${\cal H}$ is a linear differential
operator (Hamiltonian) acting on a multi-dimensional vector $\Psi$ built of the
electromagnetic inductions and auxiliary matter fields describing the medium
response. The initial value problem is then solved by means of a modified time
leapfrog method in combination with the Fourier pseudospectral method applied
on a non-uniform grid that is constructed by a change of variables and designed
to enhance the sampling efficiency near medium interfaces. The algorithm is
shown to be highly accurate at relatively low computational costs. An excellent
agreement with previous theoretical and experimental studies of the gratings is
demonstrated by numerical simulations using our algorithm. In addition, our
algorithm allows one to see real time dynamics of long leaving resonant
excitations of electromagnetic fields in the gratings in the entire frequency
range of the initial wide band wave packet as well as formation of the
reflected and transmitted wave fronts.

tunneling exponent in systems with many degrees of freedom is further
developed. It is supplemented with an easily implementable technique, which
enables one to single out the physically relevant trajectory from the whole set
of complex classical trajectories. The method is applied to semiclassical
transitions of a bound system through a potential barrier. We find that the
properties of physically relevant complex trajectories are qualitatively
different in the cases of potential tunneling at low energy and dynamical
tunneling at energies exceeding the barrier height. Namely, in the case of high
energies, the physically relevant complex trajectories describe tunneling via
creation of a state close to the top of the barrier. The method is checked
against exact solutions of the Schrodinger equation in a quantum mechanical
system of two degrees of freedom.

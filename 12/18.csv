of this binary (masses and orbital characteristics as well as age estimates),
and we derive the complete set of constraints imposed on the physical
properties of the binary pulsar progenitor right before the second supernova
explosion. We find that: (i) according to our current understanding of
neutron-star formation, the helium-rich progenitor of the second neutron star
is most likely overflowing its Roche lobe; (ii) the neutron-star kick magnitude
is constrained in the range 60-1560 km/s, with the most probable value being
equal to 150 km/s. While the first conclusion is in agreement with Dewi & van
den Heuvel (2003), our upper limit on the kick magnitude is significantly
larger than that derived by these authors. We find that the difference arises
because Dewi & van den Heuvel (2003) inadvertently neglected to consider kicks
directed out of the pre-supernova orbital plane.

merger. The temperature of the ICM is highly non-uniform across the cluster.
Although the merger is well underway and has had a substantial influence on the
morphology of the 2 sub-clusters, it has apparently not disturbed the cool
sub-cluster cores. The ICM in between the sub-clusters has a significantly
elevated temperature of ~8 keV. However, owing to the low surface brightness,
we do not find direct evidence for shocks in this region. The X-ray surface
brightness distribution of the northern sub-cluster is highly non-uniform. The
data show a bright central core region of about 10"" (30 kpc) diameter. A highly
significant surface brightness discontinuity separates the core from the
ambient ICM. We discuss several possibilities to explain the compact core, and
its relation to the central radio galaxy 3C 28.0 and the sub-cluster's cooling
flow. Further outwards, at about 24.6"" (80 kpc) to the southwest of the
sub-cluster core, the surface brightness distribution shows a jump associated
with a contact discontinuity. The Chandra imaging spectroscopy data do not show
evidence for a shock associated with the surface brightness jump. We conclude
that it is associated with denser plasma moving sub-sonically through the

formation process of a Population III star down to a scale of ~100 AU. The
simulation is initialized on the scale of a dark matter halo of mass ~10^6

fully-molecular central core, and traces the accretion from the diffuse
dust-free cloud onto the protostellar core for as long as ~10^4 yr, at which
time the core has grown to ~50 M_sun. We find that the accretion rate starts
very high, ~0.1 M_sun yr^-1, and declines rapidly thereafter approaching a
power-law temporal scaling. Asymptotically, at times t > 10^3 yr after core
formation, the stellar mass grows approximately as M_star=20 M_sun (t/10^3

extrapolating this growth over the full lifetime of very massive stars,
t~3x10^6 yr, we obtain the conservative upper limit M_star < 500 M_sun. The
actual stellar mass is, however, likely to be significantly smaller than this

studied the properties of the fourteen most luminous sources, all of which have
intrinsic X-ray luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit for a 1.4 solar mass
neutron star, with a subset in the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) regime.
Eleven sources show evidence of short-term variability, and most vary by a
factor of ~2-4 over a baseline of 11-24 yrs, providing strong evidence that
these sources are accreting X-ray binary (XRB) systems. The sources show a
variety of spectral shapes, with no apparent spectral distinction between those
above and below the ULX threshold. Nine are well-fit with either simple
absorbed disc blackbody/powerlaw models. However for three of the four sources
best-fit with powerlaw models, we cannot exclude the disc blackbody fits and
therefore conclude that, coupled with their high luminosities, eight out of
nine single-component sources are possibly high state XRBs. The nuclear source
has the only unambiguous powerlaw spectrum (photon index~2.3), which may be
evidence for a low-luminosity AGN. The remaining five sources require at least
two-component spectral fits. We have compared the spectral shapes of nine
sources covered by both this observation and an archival 100ks Chandra
observation of M101; the majority show behaviour typical of Galactic XRBs i.e.
softening with increasing luminosity. We find no definitive spectral signatures
to indicate that these sources contain neutron star primaries, and conclude
that they are likely to be stellar-mass black hole XRBs, with black hole masses
of ~2-23 solar masses if accreting at the Eddington limit (abridged).

samples are self-supporting, which can be advantageous in situations in which
interference from a supporting substrate is undesirable. The keystones may also

demonstrated the capability of homologously crushing these unmounted keystones

(LMC) possesses an old stellar halo. In order to further characterize the
properties of this halo, parametric King models are fit to the surface density
of RR Lyrae stars. Using data from both the MACHO and OGLE II microlensing
surveys, the model fits yield the center of their distribution at RA =
05:21.1+-0.8, Dec = -69:45+-6 (J2000) and a core radius of 1.42+-0.12 kpc. As a
check the halo model is compared with RR Lyrae star counts in fields near the
LMC's periphery previously surveyed with photographic plates. These data,
however, require a cautious interpretation. Several topics regarding the LMC
stellar halo are discussed. First, the properties of the halo imply a global
mass-to-light ratio of M/L_V = 5.3+-2.1 and a total mass of 1.6+-0.6 10^10
M_sun for the LMC in good agreement with estimates based on the rotation curve.
Second, although the LMC's disk and halo are kinematically distinct, the shape
of the surface density profile of the halo is remarkably similar to that of the
young disk. For example, the best-fit exponential scale length for the RR Lyrae
stars is 1.47+-0.08 kpc, which compares to 1.46 kpc for the LMC's blue light.
In the Galaxy, the halo and disk do not resemble each other like this. Finally,
a local maximum in the LMC's microlensing optical depth due to halo-on-disk
stellar self-lensing is predicted. For the parameters of the stellar halo
obtained, this maximum is located near MACHO events LMC-4 and LMC-23, and is
large enough to possibly account for these two events, but not for all of the
observed microlensing.

intergalactic abundance of [O,C/H]=-2.82; the differential abundance
distribution is approximately lognormal with mean <[C,O/H]>~-2.85 and
\sigma=0.75 dex. Some 60-70% the Lya forest lines are enriched to observable
levels ([O,C/H]>-3.5) while the remaining ~30% of the lines have even lower
abundances. Thus we have not detected a universal metallicity floor as has been
suggested for some Population III enrichment scenaria. In fact, we argue that
the bulk of the intergalactic metals formed later than the first stars that are
thought to have triggered reionization. We do not observe a significant trend
of decreasing metallicity toward the lower density IGM, at least within regions
that would be characterized as filaments in numerical simulations. However, an
[O/H] enhancement may be present at somewhat high densities. We estimate that
roughly half of all baryons at these redshifts have been enriched to
[O/H]>=-3.5. We develop a simple model for the metallicity evolution of the
IGM, to estimate the chemical yield of galaxies formed prior to z~2.5. We find
that the typical galaxy recycled 0.1-0.4% of its mass back into the IGM as

both the weaker gravitational potentials of low-redshift matter inhomogeneities

backward to the observations and theories that helped us arrive at our current
`paradigm'. I then discuss current and near-future spectroscopic studies, which
increasingly (and very fruitfully) treat X-ray spectroscopy as part of a
larger, intimately connected picture along with radio, optical, and gamma-ray

RXTE, there is now a strong realization that spectral-temporal correlations,
even across wavelength bands, are crucial to our understanding of the physics
of these systems. Going forward, we are well-poised to continue to advance our
knowledge via X-ray spectroscopy, both with existing satellites that have a
long lifetime ahead of them, and with the next generation of instruments. If
there is any `hole' in this bright future, it is the potential loss of RXTE,
with no designated follow-up mission. Studies of multi-wavelength
spectral-temporal correlations will become more difficult due to the loss of
two important attributes of RXTE: its fast timing capabilities and its
extremely flexible scheduling which has made many of these studies possible.

calculations that neglected the residual heat flow terms, we find that
diffusion is faster by ~20%. In clusters we find that the diffusion changes the
local abundance typically by factors of 1+0.3(T/10^8 K)^1.5/F_B and
1+0.15(T/10^8 K)^1.5/F_B for helium and heavy elements, respectively, where T

suppression factor F_B is modest, diffusion could significantly affect
observational properties of hot X-ray clusters and cD galaxies. In particular,
diffusion steepens the baryon distribution, increases the total X-ray
luminosity, and changes the spectrum and evolution of stars that form out of
the helium-rich gas. Detection of these diffusion signatures would allow to
gauge the significance of the magnetic fields, which also inhibit thermal heat

sensitive to star formation history, such as the 4000 A break and EW(Ha),
correlate well with distance from the mean relation for starburst galaxies in
the IRX-UV diagram, while there is little or no correlation between the
dust-sensitive Ha/Hb ratio and this distance. This is strong observational
evidence that the star formation history is relevant to the `second parameter'
affecting the IRX-UV relation. We show that these results can be understood in
the framework of the simple model of Charlot & Fall 2000 for the transfer of
starlight through the ISM in galaxies. We confirm that, for starburst galaxies,
the tight IRX-UV relation can be understood most simply as a sequence in
overall dust content. In addition, we find that the broadening of the relation

Part of the thermal energy deposited on the day side is advected to the night
side by a current. The radiation transfer, the night-side temperature
distribution and by this the spectroscopic signature of the planet are
sensitive functions of the atmospheric opacity. If the atmosphere contains
grains with an abundanceand size distribution comparable to that of the
interstellar medium, shallow heating occurs on the day side and the night side
cools well below the day side. The temperature difference decreases as the
abundance of grains is reduced. A simple analytic model of the dissipation of

effect occurs mostly near the photosphere, not deep enough to significantly
affect the size of planets. We show that the surface irradiation suppresses
convection near the photospheric region on the day side. In some cases
convection zones appear near the surface on the night side. This structural
modification may influence the response and dissipation of tidal disturbances

focus on the dependence of the saturation level of the stress on the gas
pressure, which is a key assumption in the standard alpha disk model. From our
numerical experiments it is found that there is a weak power-law relation
between the saturation level of the Maxwell stress and the gas pressure in the
nonlinear regime; the higher the gas pressure, the larger the stress. Although
the power-law index depends slightly on the initial field geometry, the
relationship between stress and gas pressure is independent of the initial
field strength, and is unaffected by Ohmic dissipation if the magnetic Reynolds
number is at least 10. The relationship is the same in adiabatic calculations,
where pressure increases over time, and nearly-isothermal calculations, where
pressure varies little with time. Our numerical results are qualitatively
consistent with an idea that the saturation level of the MRI is determined by a
balance between the growth of the MRI and the dissipation of the field through
reconnection. The quantitative interpretation of the pressure-stress relation,
however, may require advances in the theoretical understanding of non-steady
magnetic reconnection.

consequences for the explanation of the observed non-thermal phenomena in

to couple the fluid turbulence, supposedly injected during cluster mergers, to

atomic or molecular input data are (or will be) essential, with special
emphasis on topics relating to nucleosynthesis and cosmochemistry.
  We first discuss issues (like the abundances of oxygen and iron in the Sun,
and that of lithium in post-AGB stars) where the use of poor-quality atomic or
molecular data have led to spurious astrophysical puzzles which sparked fancy
astrophysical models or theories. We then address issues where the advent of
new instruments (like the ultraviolet high-resolution spectrographs--GHRS
onboard HST, Keck-HRS or VLT-UVES--or future infrared satellites) calls for new
and accurate atomic or molecular data.

summary of an ongoing exploration of the parameter space of the problem, and we

gas in ""cooling flow"" galaxy clusters has a mass cooling rate that decreases
rapidly with decreasing temperature. This contrasts the predictions of a steady
state cooling flow model. On the basis of these observational results, the gas
can be in a steady state only if a steady temperature dependent heating
mechanism is present; alternatively the gas could be in an unsteady state,
i.e., heated intermittently. Intermittent heating can be produced by accretion
on the supermassive black hole residing in the central cluster galaxy, via
Compton heating. This mechanism can be effective provided that the radiation
temperature of the emitted spectrum is higher than the gas temperature. Here we
explore whether this heating mechanism can be at the origin of the enigmatic
behavior of the hot gas in the central regions of ``cooling flow'' clusters.
Although several characteristics of Compton heating appear attractive in this
respect, we find that the fraction of absorbed heating for realistic gas and
radiation temperatures falls short by two orders of magnitude of the required
heating.

reduced when the tension is increased. At high tension the fusion pore, created
when a hole forms in the hemifusion diaphragm, expands without bound. At very
low membrane tension, small fusion pores can be trapped in a flickering
metastable state. Successful fusion is severely limited by the architecture of
the lipids. If the effective spontaneous curvature is not sufficiently
negative, fusion does not occur because metastable stalks, whose existence is a
seemingly necessary prerequisite, do not form at all. However if the
spontaneous curvature is too negative, stalks are so stable that fusion does
not occur because the system is unstable either to a phase of stable radial
stalks, or to an inverted-hexagonal phase induced by stable linear stalks. Our
results on the architecture and tension needed for successful fusion are
summarized in a phase diagram.

infinity of stationary states of the associated $N ~$ Vlasov dynamics. In this
context, we derive a new general criterion for the stability of any spatially
homogeneous distribution, and compare its analytical predictions with numerical
simulations of the Hamiltonian, finite $N$, dynamics. We then propose and
verify numerically a scenario for the relaxation process, relying on the Vlasov
equation. When starting from a non stationary or a Vlasov unstable stationary
initial state, the system shows initially a rapid convergence towards a stable
stationary state of the Vlasov equation via non stationary states: we
characterize numerically this dynamical instability in the finite $N$ system by
introducing appropriate indicators. This first step of the evolution towards
Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium is followed by a slow quasi-stationary process,
that proceeds through different stable stationary states of the Vlasov
equation. If the finite $N$ system is initialized in a Vlasov stable homogenous
state, it remains trapped in a quasi-stationary state for times that increase
with the nontrivial power law $N^{1.7}$. Single particle momentum distributions
in such a quasi-stationary regime do not have power-law tails, and hence cannot
be fitted by the $q$-exponential distributions derived from Tsallis statistics.

distribution is the uniform distribution or a computable distribution. These
restrictions seem artificial. Some progress has been made to extend the theory
to arbitrary Bernoulli distributions (by Martin-Loef), and to arbitrary
distributions (by Levin). We recall the main ideas and problems of Levin's
theory, and report further progress in the same framework.
  - We allow non-compact spaces (like the space of continuous functions,
underlying the Brownian motion).
  - The uniform test (deficiency of randomness) d_P(x) (depending both on the
outcome x and the measure P should be defined in a general and natural way.
  - We see which of the old results survive: existence of universal tests,
conservation of randomness, expression of tests in terms of description
complexity, existence of a universal measure, expression of mutual information
as ""deficiency of independence.
  - The negative of the new randomness test is shown to be a generalization of
complexity in continuous spaces; we show that the addition theorem survives.

naked-singularity formation. In this paper we are concerned with particle
creation during a naked-singularity formation in spherically symmetric
self-similar collapse without specifying the collapsing matter. In the generic
case, the power of particle emission is found to be proportional to the inverse
square of the remaining time to the Cauchy horizon (CH). The constant of
proportion can be arbitrarily large in the limit to marginally naked
singularity. Therefore, the unbounded power is especially striking in the case
that an event horizon is very close to the CH because the emitted energy can be
arbitrarily large in spite of a cutoff expected from quantum gravity. Above
results suggest the instability of the CH in spherically symmetric self-similar
spacetime from quantum field theory and seem to support the existence of a
semiclassical cosmic censor. The divergence of redshifts and blueshifts of
emitted particles is found to cause the divergence of power to positive or
negative infinity, depending on the coupling manner of scalar fields to
gravity. On the other hand, it is found that there is a special class of
self-similar spacetimes in which the semiclassical instability of the CH is not
efficient. The analyses in this paper are based on the geometric optics
approximation, which is justified in two dimensions but needs justification in
four dimensions.

claims they are ""simply wrong"" because they rely on an incorrect account of how

Albert sees no reason for the asymmetric treatment, and insists that neither
field should be inverted. I argue, to the contrary, that the inversion of
magnetic fields makes good sense and is, in fact, forced by elementary
geometric considerations. I also suggest a way of thinking about the time
reversal invariance of classical electromagnetic theory -- one that makes use
of the invariant four-dimensional formulation of the theory -- that makes no
reference to magnetic fields at all. It is my hope that it will be of interest
in its own right, Albert aside. It has the advantage that it allows for
arbitrary curvature in the background spacetime structure, and is therefore
suitable for the framework of general relativity. The only assumption one needs

constructed in which the electroweak symmetry is broken by boundary conditions
imposed at a boundary of higher dimensional spacetime. These theories have
equivalent 4D dual descriptions, in which the electroweak symmetry is
dynamically broken by non-trivial infrared dynamics of some gauge interaction,
whose coupling g and size N satisfy g^2N > 16pi^2. Such theories allow one to
calculate electroweak radiative corrections, including the oblique parameters
S, T and U, as long as g^2N/16pi^2 and N are large. We study how the duality
between the 4D and 5D theories manifests itself in the computation of various
physical quantities. In particular, we study a warped 5D theory where the
electroweak symmetry is broken by boundary conditions at the infrared brane. We
show that S exceeds the experimental bound if the minimal theory is in a weakly
coupled regime. This requires either an extension of the model or departure
from weak coupling. An interesting scenario is obtained if the gauge couplings
in the 5D theory take the largest possible values -- the value suggested by
naive dimensional analysis. We argue that such a theory can provide a
potentially consistent picture for dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking:
corrections to the electroweak observables are sufficiently small while
realistic fermion masses are obtained without conflicting with bounds from
flavor violation. The theory contains only the standard model quarks, leptons
and gauge bosons below \sim 2 TeV, except for a possible light radion. At \sim
2 TeV increasingly broad string resonances appear. An analysis of top-quark
phenomenology and flavor violation is also presented, which is applicable to
both the weakly-coupled and strongly-coupled cases.

take into account also the production of hot glue at first stage. The energy
loss in expanding plasma is calculated in dominant first order of radiation
intensity with accounting of finite kinematic bounds. We calculate the
suppression of $\pi^0$ - spectra with moderate high $p_{\perp}$, which is
caused by energy loss of quark and gluon jets. The comparison with suppression
of $\pi^0$ reported by PHENIX show, that correct quantitative description of
suppression we have only in model of phase transition with decrease of thermal
gluon mass and effective coupling $G(T)$ in region of phase transition plasma
into hadrons (at $T \simeq T_c$). However quasiparticle model with increase of
these values at $T \to T_c$ in accordance with perturbative QCD lead to too
great energy loss of gluon and quark jets, which disagrees with data on
suppression of $\pi^0$. Thus it is possible with help of hard processes to
investigate the structure of phase transition. We show also, that energy losses
at SPS energy are too small in order to be observable. This is caused in fact
by sufficiently short plasma phase at this energy.

photon decays in a quark-antiquark pair, ii) the on-shell quark-hadron vertex
functions in the valence sector, and iii) the non-valence component of the

theories of relativity, a nontrivial spacetime physical picture, which has a
slight difference from the standard one, is introduced by making a further
distinction on the absolute background of spacetime and the relative length or
duration of base units of spacetime. In this picture, the coordinate base units
in gravity-induced spacetime metric are defined by the standard clock and ruler
equipped by the observer, and duplicated onto the every position of the whole
universe. In contrast, the local intrinsic base units of spacetime in
gravitational field are defined by the length and duration of physical events
intervals in the same-type standard clock and ruler which are really located at
every position of the universe. In principle, the reading number of the
standard clock is counted by the undergone times of unit intervals defined
depending on a certain kind of local intrinsic events. But the size of the base
units of spacetime is essentially depicted by the length of the line segment,
which is cut from the absolute background of spacetime by the local intrinsic
events of unit interval. The effect of gravitation is just to change the length
of this segment for base spacetime units. On the basis of such a physical
picture of spacetime, in a fairly natural way we re-derive a new classical
dynamical equation which satisfies a more realistic and moderately general
principle of relativity. To further examine this physical picture including of
gravitation and spacetime, we also reinterpret the gravitational redshifts for
solar gravity tests.

all energy and all loop orders in string perturbation theory. The high-energy
limit of these stringy symmetries can then be used to fix the proportionality
constants between scattering amplitudes of different string states
algebraically without referring to Gross and Mende's saddle point calculation
of high-energy string-loop amplitudes. These proportionality constants are, as
conjectured by Gross, independent of the scattering angle and the order of
string perturbation theory. However, we also discover some new nonzero
components of high-energy amplitudes not found previously by Gross and Manes.
These components are essential to preserve massive gauge invariances or
decouple massive zero-norm states of string theory. A set of massive scattering

conformal group with dimensionful deformation parameter $\kappa$. Firstly we
discuss the noncommutativity following from the Lie-Poisson structure described
by the light-cone $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} $r$-matrix. We present complete set of
D=4 conformal Lie-Poisson brackets and discuss their quantization. Further we
define the light-cone $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} quantum $R$-matrix in O(4,2) vector
representation and discuss the inclusion of noncommutative conformal
translations into the framework of $\kappa$-deformed conformal quantum group.

attention is paid to the correct definition of composite gauge invariant local
operators, which is necessary for the computation of their anomalous dimensions
beyond lowest order. As an application we reconsider the case of operators with
naive dimension Delta_0=4, already studied in the literature. Stringent
constraints from the resummation of logarithms in power behaviours are
exploited and the role of the generalized N = 4 Konishi anomaly in the mixing
with operators involving fermions is discussed. A general method for the
explicit (numerical) resolution of the operator mixing and the computation of
anomalous dimensions is proposed. We then resolve the order g^2 mixing for the
15 (purely scalar) singlet operators of naive dimension \Delta_0=6. Rather
surprisingly we find one isolated operator which has a vanishing anomalous
dimension up to order g^4, belonging to an apparently long multiplet. We also
solve the order g^2 mixing for the 26 operators belonging to the representation
20' of SU(4). We find an operator with the same one-loop anomalous dimension as
the Konishi multiplet.

Imposing one time-like Killing vector permits us to express the stationary
effective action as a model in which gravity is coupled to a matrix Ernst
potential which, under certain parametrization, allows us to interpret the
matter sector of this theory as a double Ernst system. We generate a web of
string vacua which are related to each other via a set of discrete symmetries
of the effective action (some of them involve S-duality transformations and
possess non-perturbative character). Some physical implications of these
discrete symmetries are analyzed and we find that, in some particular cases,
they relate rotating black holes coupled to a dilaton with no Kalb--Ramond
field, static black holes with non-trivial dilaton and antisymmetric tensor
fields, and rotating and static naked singularities. Further, by applying a
nonlinear symmetry, namely, the so-called normalized Harrison transformation,
on the seed field configurations corresponding to these neutral backgrounds, we
recover the U(1)^n Abelian vector sector of the four-dimensional action of the
heterotic string, charging in this way the double Ernst system which
corresponds to each one of the neutral string vacua, i.e., the stationary and
the static black holes and the naked singularities.

an observable density (such as an energy density) which is classically
pointwise nonnegative may assume arbitrarily negative expectation values after
quantisation, even though the spatially integrated density remains nonnegative.
Two prominent examples which have previously been studied are the energy
density (in quantum field theory) and the probability flux of rightwards-moving
particles (in quantum mechanics). However, in the quantum field context, it has
been shown that the magnitude and space-time extension of negative energy
densities are not arbitrary, but restricted by relations which have come to be
known as `quantum inequalities'. In the present work, we explore the extent to
which such quantum inequalities hold for typical quantum mechanical systems. We
derive quantum inequalities of two types. The first are `kinematical' quantum
inequalities where spatially averaged densities are shown to be bounded below.
Such quantum inequalities are directly related to Garding inequalities. The
second type are `dynamical' quantum inequalities where one obtains bounds from
below on temporally averaged densities. We derive such quantum inequalities in
the case of the energy density in general quantum mechanical systems having
suitable decay properties on the negative spectral axis of the total energy.
Furthermore, we obtain explicit numerical values for the quantum inequalities
on the one-dimensional current density, using various spatial averaging weight
functions. We also improve the numerical value of the related `backflow
constant' previously investigated by Bracken and Melloy. In many cases our
numerical results are controlled by rigorous error estimates.

  We finally give an explicit derivative computation for the restriction of a
harmonic function on SG to segments at specific points of the segments: The
derivative is zero at points dividing the segment in ratio 1:3. This shows that
the restriction of a harmonic function to a segment of SG has the following
curious property: The restriction has infinite derivatives on a dense set of
the segment (at junction points) and vanishing derivatives on another dense
set.

to a circle pattern, consisting of the circles which are circumscribed to the

for a given (topological) cell decomposition and given intersection angles of
the circles, whether it is unique and how it may be constructed. Somewhat more
generally, we allow cone-like singularities in the centers and intersection
points of the circles. We prove existence and uniqueness theorems for the
solution of the circle pattern problem using a variational principle. The
functionals (one for the euclidean, one for the hyperbolic case) are convex
functions of the radii of the circles. The analogous functional for the
spherical case is not convex, hence this case is treated by stereographic
projection to the plane. From the existence and uniqueness of circle patterns
in the sphere, we derive a strengthened version of Steinitz' theorem on the
geometric realizability of abstract polyhedra.
  We derive the variational principles of Colin de Verdi\`ere, Br\""agger, and
Rivin for circle packings and circle patterns from our variational principles.
In the case of Br\""agger's and Rivin's functionals. Leibon's functional for
hyperbolic circle patterns cannot be derived directly from our functionals. But
we construct yet another functional from which both Leibon's and our

breathers (DGBs and DOGBs) -- are investigated. Their linear stability is
studied varying the system parameters from the continuous to the
anti-continuous limit, and different types of oscillatory and real
instabilities are revealed. It is shown, that generally DGBs in infinite
modulated DNLS chains with hard (soft) nonlinearity do not possess any
oscillatory instabilities for breather frequencies in the lower (upper) half of
the gap. Regimes of 'exchange of stability' between symmetric and antisymmetric
DGBs are observed, where an increased breather mobility is expected. The
transformation from DGBs to DOGBs when the breather frequency enters the linear

of different wave numbers is described. Close to the anti-continuous limit, the
localized linear eigenmodes and their corresponding eigenfrequencies are
calculated analytically for several gap/out-gap breather configurations,
yielding explicit proof of their linear stability or instability close to this

250nm covering almost all the photonic band gap owing to nearly linear
dispersion of the TE-like waveguiding mode. The flat transmission spectrum
however is interrupted by numerous narrow stop bands. We found that these stop
bands can be attributed to anti-crossing between TE-like (positive parity) and
TM-like (negative parity) modes. This effect is a direct result of the strong
asymmetry of the waveguides that have an upper cladding of air and lower
cladding of oxide. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of the

from experimental data. The modeling framework used is time-discrete
deterministic dynamical systems, with a finite set of states for each of the
variables. The simplest examples of such models are Boolean networks, in which
variables have only two possible states. The use of a larger number of possible
states allows a finer discretization of experimental data and more than one
possible mode of action for the variables, depending on threshold values.
Furthermore, with a suitable choice of state set, one can employ powerful tools
from computational algebra, that underlie the reverse-engineering algorithm,
avoiding costly enumeration strategies. To perform well, the algorithm requires
wildtype together with perturbation time courses. This makes it suitable for
small to meso-scale networks rather than networks on a genome-wide scale. The
complexity of the algorithm is quadratic in the number of variables and cubic
in the number of time points. The algorithm is validated on a recently
published Boolean network model of segment polarity development in Drosophila
melanogaster.

probabilistic interpretation while the evolution of the state is treated
deterministically. Here we show that one can also treat the evolution as being
probabilistic in nature and one can measure `which unitary' happened. Likewise,
one can give an information-theoretic interpretation to evolutions by defining
the entropy of a completely positive map. This entropy gives the rate at which
the informational content of the evolution can be compressed. One cannot
compress this information and still have the evolution act on an unknown state,
but we demonstrate a general scheme to do so probabilistically. This allows one
to generalize super-dense coding to the sending of quantum information. One can
also define the ``interaction-entanglement'' of a unitary, and concentrate this
entanglement.

  probabilities: A note on ""Environment-assisted invariance, entanglement, and

bipartite quantum systems in pure joint states, from the assumption that they
should be not be affected by one party's action if the action can be undone by
the other party (``envariance of probability'') and an auxiliary assumption. We
argue that a natural generalization of the auxiliary assumption is actually
strong enough to yield the Born rule itself, but that Zurek's argument and
protocol can be adapted to do without this assumption, at the cost of using
envariance of probability in both directions. We consider alternative
motivations for envariance, one based on the no-signalling constraint that
actions on one subsystem of a quantum system not allow signalling to another
subsystem entirely distinct from the first, and another which is perhaps
strongest in the context of a relative-state interpretation of quantum
mechanics. In part because of this, we argue that the relative appeal of our
version and the original version of Zurek's argument depends in part upon
whether one interprets the quantum formalism in terms of relative states or
definite measurement outcomes.

regarding information flow are equivocal. The second, ontological,

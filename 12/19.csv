show no appreciable evolution during the observations, and indicate the

concentrating on recent data and on results from our group's research.
Spectropolarimetry provides the only direct known probe of early-time supernova
geometry. To obtain reliable conclusions, however, it is very important to
correctly account for interstellar polarization. We find that Type IIn
supernovae (SNe IIn) tend to be highly polarized, perhaps in part because of
the interaction of the ejecta with an asymmetric circumstellar medium. In
contrast, SNe II-P are not polarized much, at least shortly after the
explosion. At later times, however, there is evidence for increasing
polarization, as one views deeper into the expanding ejecta. Moreover,
core-collapse SNe that have lost part (SN IIb) or all (SN Ib) of their hydrogen
(or even helium; SN Ic) layers prior to the explosion tend to show substantial
polarization; thus, the deeper we probe into core-collapse events, the greater
the asphericity. There is now conclusive evidence that at least some SNe Ia are
intrinsically polarized, although only by a small amount. Finally, SN
spectropolarimetry provides the opportunity to study the fundamental properties
of the interstellar dust in external galaxies. For example, we have found
evidence for extremely high polarization efficiency for the dust along the
line-of-sight to SN 1999gi in NGC 3184.

""clean"" probes of the epoch of reionization because no complications (such as
the presence of a strong Ly-alpha emission line) or ""proximity effects"" (such
as the Stromgren sphere produced by ionizing photons from the quasar) are
expected. Thus NIR and optical observations of GRB afterglows may provide
unique information about the epoch of reionization. In particular, the flux at
wavelengths shortward of Ly-alpha provides a direct measure of the density
fluctuations of the IGM at the GRB redshift, while the flux at wavelengths
longward of Ly-alpha provides an integrated measure of the number of ionizing
photons produced by stars in the host galaxy of the GRB up until the burst
occurs. A comparison of the sizes of the Stromgren spheres produced by stars in
the host galaxies of GRBs and by quasars then provides an estimate of the
relative contributions of star formation and quasars to reionization. We use
detailed calculations of the expected shape of the GRB afterglow spectrum in
the vicinity of Ly-alpha for GRBs at a variety of redshifts to illustrate these
points.

are the same phenomenon. We show that both the structured jet and the uniform
jet models can explain the observed properties of GRBs reasonably well.
However, if one tries to account for the properties of both XRFs and GRBs in a
unified picture, the uniform jet model works reasonably well while the
structured jet model fails utterly. The uniform jet model of XRFs and GRBs
implies that most GRBs have very small jet opening angles (~ half a degree).
This suggests that magnetic fields play a crucial role in GRB jets. The model
also implies that the energy radiated in gamma rays is ~100 times smaller than
has been thought. Most importantly, the model implies that there are ~10^4
-10^5 more bursts with very small jet opening angles for every such burst we
see. Thus the rate of GRBs could be comparable to the rate of Type Ic core
collapse supernovae. Accurate, rapid localizations of many XRFs, leading to
identification of their X-ray and optical afterglows and the determination of
their redshifts, will be required in order to confirm or rule out these
profound implications.

is calculated from a one-zone model using analytic fits to low temperature
Rosseland mean opacities. The model has two parameters: the initial surface
density Sigma_0 and the rotation frequency Omega. We survey the parameter space
and find: (1) The disk fragments when t_c,eff Omega = 1, where t_c,eff is an
effective cooling time defined as the average internal energy of the model
divided by the average cooling rate. This is consistent with earlier results
that used a simplified cooling function. (2) The initial cooling time t_c0 or a
uniform disk with Q = 1 can differ by orders of magnitude from t_c,eff in the
nonlinear outcome. The difference is caused by sharp variations in the opacity
with temperature. The condition t_c0 Omega = 1 therefore does not necessarily
indicate where fragmentation will occur. (3) The largest difference between
t_c,eff and t_c0 is near the opacity gap, where dust is absent and hydrogen is
largely molecular. (4) In the limit of strong illumination the disk is
isothermal; we find that an isothermal version of our model fragments for Q <
1.4. Finally, we discuss some physical processes not included in our model, and
find that most are likely to make disks more susceptible to fragmentation. We
conclude that disks with t_c,eff Omega < 1 do not exist.

spectral lines. Detailed examination of these dispersed images reveals Doppler
shifts within the supernova remnant, indicating bulk matter velocities on the

structure with additional substructure, inclined to the line of sight. A
two-dimensional spatial/velocity map of the SNR shows a striking spatial
separation of redshifted and blueshifted regions, and indicates a need for
further investigation before an adequate 3D model can be found. The radii of
the ring-like images of the dispersed spectrum vary with ionization stage,
supporting an interpretation of progressive ionization due to passage of the
reverse shock through the ejecta. Plasma diagnostics with individual emission
lines of oxygen are consistent with an ionizing plasma in the low density

Magellan Observatory yields a redshift z=0.6174 for the lensing galaxy, and we
photometrically estimate z_phot = 2.4\pm0.3 for the arc. We also identify a
likely counter-arc at a radius of 0.6 arcsec, which shows structure similar to
that seen in the main arc. We model this system and find a good fit to an
elliptical isothermal potential of velocity dispersion $\sigma \approx 300$
\kms, the value expected from the fundamental plane, and some external shear.
Several other galaxies in the field have colors similar to the lensing galaxy
and likely make up a small group.

H$\alpha$ emission is ascribed to star formation with a rate nearly as high as
that is seen in typical late spiral galaxies. This is taken as evidence against
the traditional view that all elliptical galaxies formed early and now evolve
only passively. The frequency of such star forming elliptical galaxies is a few
tenths of a percent in the sample, but increases to 3% if we include active S0
galaxies. We may identify these galaxies as probable progenitors of so-called
E+A galaxies that show the strong Balmer absorption feature of A stars
superimposed on an old star population. The approximate match of the abundance
of active elliptical plus S0 galaxies with that of E+A galaxies indicates that
the duration of such late star formation episodes is of the order of $\gsim 1$

the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. This value is
consistent with that derived by Gallego et al. (1995), but this agreement is
caused by a fortuitous cancellation of their neglect of stellar absorption that

incompleteness of emission line galaxies. The fraction of H$\alpha$ emitters
monotonically increases from early (a few % for ellipticals) to late types

1.5 times that of the Sun, each with a mass fraction of metals (metallicity, Z)
from 0.008 to 0.05. The extent of each star's habitable zone (HZ) has been
determined from its values of L and T(e). These stars form a reference
framework for other main sequence stars. All of the 104 main sequence stars
known to have one or more giant planets have been matched to their nearest
stellar counterpart in the framework, in terms of mass and metallicity, hence
closely approximating their HZ limits. The limits of HZ, for each of these
stars, have been compared to its giant planet(s)'s range of strong
gravitational influence. This allows a quick assessment as to whether
Earth-mass planets could exist in stable orbits within the HZ of such systems,
both presently and at any time during the star's main sequence lifetime. A
determination can also be made as to the possible existence of life-bearing
satellites of giant planets, which orbit within HZs. Results show that about
half of the 104 known extrasolar planetary systems could possibly have been
housing an Earth-mass planet in HZs during at least the past billion years, and
about three-quarters of the 104 could do so for at least a billion years at
some time during their main sequence lives. Whether such Earth-mass planets
could have formed is an urgent question now being investigated by others, with
encouraging results.

simple method of combining shock dynamics and radiation spectrum. The hot spots
are identified with the reverse shocked region of jets. With the
one-dimensional shock jump conditions taking account of the finite pressure of
hot ICM, we estimate the rest mass and energy densities of the sum of thermal
and non-thermal particles in hot spots. Independently, based on the Synchrotron
Self-Compton (SSC) model, we estimate the number and energy densities of {\it
non-thermal} electrons using the multi-frequency radiation spectrum of hot
spots. We impose the condition that the obtained rest mass, internal energy,
and number densities of non-thermal electrons should be lower than those of the
total particles determined by shock dynamics. We apply this method to Cygnus A.
We examine three extreme cases of pure electron-positron pair plasma (Case I),
pure electron-proton plasma with separate thermalization (Case II), and pure
electron-proton plasma in thermal-equilibrium (Case III). By detailed SSC
analysis for Cygnus A and 3C123, we find that the energy density of non-thermal
electrons is about 10 times larger than that of magnetic field. We find that
the Case III is not acceptable because predicted photon spectra do not give a
good fit to the observed one. We find that Case II can also be ruled out since
the number density of non-thermal electrons exceeds that of the total number
density. Hence, we find that only pure $e^{\pm}$ plasma (Case I) is acceptable
among the three cases. Total kinetic power of jet and electron acceleration
efficiency are also constrained by internal energy densities of non-thermal and
total particles.

This analysis includes identification of void regions and measurement of void
statistics. The 2dFGRS is the largest completed redshift survey to date,
including a total of 245,591 galaxies covering 1500 deg$^2$ to a median depth
of z~0.11. We use the voidfinder algorithm to identify a total of 289 voids in
the 2dFGRS with radius larger than 10h^{-1}Mpc. These voids have an average
effective radius of 14.89+- 2.65 h^{-1}Mpc in the North Galactic Pole region
(NGP) and 15.61+- 2.84h^{-1}Mpc in the South Galactic Pole region (SGP). These
voids are extremely underdense, with average density contrast of delta rho/rho=
-0.94+-0.02. The centers of voids are even emptier, because the few galaxies
within the voids typically lie close to the edges. The total volume of the
universe filled by these void regions is approximately 40%. We measure the Void
Probability Function (VPF) of the 2dFGRS for volume-limited samples with
limiting absolute magnitudes from -16 to -21 in b_J. We measure the
Underdensity Probability Function for samples with limiting absolute magnitudes
from -18 to -21. We find that the SGP is more underdense than the NGP for all
but the brightest sample under consideration. There is good agreement between
the VPF's of the Center for Astrophysics Survey and the 2dFGRS. Comparison of
VPF's measured for the 2dFGRS with the distribution of simulated dark-matter
halos of similar number density indicates that voids in the matter distribution
in LCDM simulations are not empty enough. However, semi-analytic models of
galaxy formation that include feedback effects yield VPF's that show excellent
agreement with the data.

decoherence sources, the material-inherent sources of noise start to play
crucial role. One representative example is electron traps in the device
material or substrate. Electrons can tunnel or hop between a charged and an
empty trap, or between a trap and a gate electrode. A single trap typically
produces telegraph noise and can hence be modeled as a bistable fluctuator.
Since the distribution of hopping rates is exponentially broad, many traps
produce flicker-noise with spectrum close to 1/f. Here we develop a theory of
decoherence of a qubit in the environment consisting of two-state fluctuators,
which experience transitions between their states induced by interaction with
thermal bath. Due to interaction with the qubit the fluctuators produce
1/f-noise in the qubit's eigenfrequency. We calculate the results of qubit
manipulations - free induction and echo signals - in such environment. The main
problem is that in many important cases the relevant random process is both
non-Markovian and non-Gaussian. Consequently the results in general cannot be
represented by pair correlation function of the qubit eigenfrequency
fluctuations. Our calculations are based on analysis of the density matrix of
the qubit using methods developed for stochastic differential equations. The
proper generating functional is then averaged over different fluctuators using
the so-called Holtsmark procedure. The analytical results are compared with
simulations allowing checking accuracy of the averaging procedure and
evaluating mesoscopic fluctuations. The results allow understanding some
observed features of the echo decay in Josephson qubits.

The three 2-body reduced density matrices $\gamma_{\uparrow\uparrow}$,
$\gamma_{\downarrow\downarrow}$, $\gamma_a$ are 4-point functions for electron
pairs with spins $\uparrow\uparrow$, $\downarrow\downarrow$, and antiparallel,
respectively. From them, three functions $G_{\uparrow\uparrow}(x,y)$,

1-body reduced density matrices. The contraction properties of the 2-body
reduced density matrices lead to three sum rules to be obeyed by the three key
functions $G_{ss}$, $G_a$. These contraction sum rules contain corresponding
normalization sum rules as special cases. The momentum distributions
$n_\uparrow(k)$ and $n_\downarrow(k)$, following from $f_\uparrow(r)$ and
$f_\downarrow(r)$ by Fourier transform, are correctly normalized through
$f_s(0)=1$. In addition to the non-negativity conditions

the spin-unpolarized homogeneous electron gas in terms of 2-body wave functions

while greater than zero in the perpendicular directions. The energy supplied to
the perpendicular directions is dissipated by particle-wall collisions. We
further define a fractional energy transfer, which in the steady state
represents the fraction of the power supplied by the vibrating base that is
dissipated at the wall. We examine the dependence of the fractional energy
transfer on the number of particles, the velocity of the vibrating base, the
particle-particle restitution coefficient, and the particle-wall restitution

ferromagnetic couplings is strongly first order for large q, while is rounded
in the presence of quenched disorder. Here we study this phenomenon on
different two-dimensional lattices by using the fact that the partition
function of the model is dominated by a single diagram of the high-temperature
expansion, which is calculated by an efficient combinatorial optimization
algorithm. For a given finite sample with discrete randomness the free energy
is a pice-wise linear function of the temperature, which is rounded after
averaging, however the discontinuity of the internal energy at the transition
point (i.e. the latent heat) stays finite even in the thermodynamic limit. For
a continuous disorder, instead, the latent heat vanishes. At the phase
transition point the dominant diagram percolates and the total magnetic moment
is related to the size of the percolating cluster. Its fractal dimension is
found d_f=(5+\sqrt{5})/4 and it is independent of the type of the lattice and
the form of disorder. We argue that the critical behavior is exclusively
determined by disorder and the corresponding fixed point is the isotropic
version of the so called infinite randomness fixed point, which is realized in
random quantum spin chains. From this mapping we conjecture the values of the
critical exponents as \beta=2-d_f, \beta_s=1/2 and \nu=1.

can be given independent, first-class status. We adopt probability theory as
the mathematical formalism for manipulating uncertainty. An agent can express
the uncertainty in her knowledge about a piece of information in the form of a
confidence level, consisting of a pair of intervals of probability, one for
each of her belief and doubt. The space of confidence levels naturally leads to
the notion of a trilattice, similar in spirit to Fitting's bilattices.
Intuitively, thep oints in such a trilattice can be ordered according to truth,
information, or precision. We develop a framework for probabilistic deductive
databases by associating confidence levels with the facts and rules of a
classical deductive database. While the trilattice structure offers a variety
of choices for defining the semantics of probabilistic deductive databases, our
choice of semantics is based on the truth-ordering, which we find to be closest
to the classical framework for deductive databases. In addition to proposing a
declarative semantics based on valuations and an equivalent semantics based on
fixpoint theory, we also propose a proof procedure and prove it sound and
complete. We show that while classical Datalog query programs have a polynomial
time data complexity, certain query programs in the probabilistic deductive
database framework do not even terminate on some input databases. We identify a
large natural class of query programs of practical interest in our framework,
and show that programs in this class possess polynomial time data complexity,
i.e., not only do they terminate on every input database, they are guaranteed
to do so in a number of steps polynomial in the input database size.

approximate lepton flavor symmetries at or below the weak scale, light
pseudo-Goldstone bosons recouple to the cosmic neutrinos after nucleosynthesis

era. Deviations from the Standard Model are predicted for both the total energy
density in radiation during this epoch, \Delta N_nu, and for the multipole of
the n'th CMB peak at large n, \Delta l_n. The latter signal is difficult to
reproduce other than by scattering of the known neutrinos, and is therefore an
ideal test of our class of theories. In many models, the large shift, \Delta
l_n \approx 8 n_S, depends on the number of neutrino species that scatter via
the pseudo-Goldstone boson interaction. This interaction is proportional to the
neutrino masses, so that the signal reflects the neutrino spectrum. The
prediction for \Delta N_nu is highly model dependent, but can be accurately
computed within any given model. It is very sensitive to the number of
pseudo-Goldstone bosons, and therefore to the underlying symmetries of the
leptons, and is typically in the region of 0.03 < \Delta N_nu < 1. This signal
is significantly larger for Majorana neutrinos than for Dirac neutrinos, and,
like the scattering signal, varies as the spectrum of neutrinos is changed from
hierarchical to inverse hierarchical to degenerate.

gauge group $G$ is broken to various nonabelian subgroups $H $ by an adjoint
Higgs VEV. When the low-energy gauge group $H$ is further broken completely by
e.g. squark VEVs, the monopoles representing $\pi_2(G/H)$ are confined by the
nonabelian vortices arising from the breaking of $H$, discussed recently
(hep-th/0307278). By considering the system with $G=SU(N+1)$, $ H = {SU(N)
\times U(1) {\o}{\mathbb Z}_N}$, as an example, we show that the total magnetic
flux of the minimal monopole agrees precisely with the total magnetic flux
flowing along the single minimal vortex.
  The possibility for such an analysis reflects the presence of free parameters
in the theory - the bare quark mass $m$ and the adjoint mass $\mu$ - such that
for $m \gg \mu$ the topologically nontrivial solutions of vortices and of
unconfined monopoles exist at distinct energy scales.

purely winding modes) have the integrable structure of Toda hierarchies,
extending the well known results for c=1 string. In particular, we show that
type 0A(0B) MQM perturbed by momentum modes has the same integrable structure

the T-duality between the matrix models. The MQM deformed by NS-NS winding

intriguing connection between the IMM and the MQM via tachyon condensation. The
array of alternating D-instantons and anti-D-instantons separated at the

Hamiltonians, $H = -\Delta + V({x}),$ acting on functions of a smooth, compact
$d$-dimensional manifold $M$ immersed in $\bbr^{\nu}, \nu \geq d+1$. Here
$\Delta$ denotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator, and the real-valued

be complete or it may have a boundary, in which case Dirichlet boundary
conditions are imposed.
  It is found that the mean curvature of a manifold poses tight constraints on
the spectrum of $H$. Further, a special algebraic r\^ole is found to be played
by a Schr\""odinger operator with potential proportional to the square of the
mean curvature: $$H_{g} := -\Delta + g h^2,$$ where $\nu = d+1$, $g$ is a real
parameter, and $$h := \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{d} {\kappa_j},$$ with
$\{\kappa_j\}$, $j = 1, ..., d$ denoting the principal curvatures of $M$. For
instance, by Theorem \ref{thm3.1} and Corollary \ref{cor4.5}, each eigenvalue
gap of an arbitrary Schr\""odinger operator is bounded above by an expression
using $H_{1/4}$. The ""isoperimetric"" parts of these theorems state that these

number of target nucleons. It samples complete events and allows thus for the
simultaneous consideration of all particle species measured. The overall
reproduction of the data is quite satisfactory. It is shown that the
contributions from the interaction of the projectile with groups of several

Since the collective features of subthreshold production become especially
significant far below the threshold, the results are extrapolated down to COSY
energies. It is concluded that an antiproton measurement at ANKE-COSY should be
feasible, if the high background of other particles can be efficiently

reported. Two improvements are introduced. First the delay between

from a few microseconds in the original experiment to 1 second in this
replication. Second, rather than using the observers conscious response as the
dependent variable, we use the early brain responses as measured by EEG. These
early responses cover a period where the observer is not yet conscious of the
quantum event. Results support the 'subjective reduction' hypothesis because
significant differences between the brain responses of the final observer are
found dependent upon the pre-observer looking or not looking at the quantum

of the key traits displayed by the global structure of cellular networks might
be a natural result of a duplication-diversification (DD) process. One of the
consequences of such evolution is the emergence of a small world architecture
together with a scale-free distribution of interactions. Here we show that the
domain of parameter space were such structure emerges is related to a phase
transition phenomenon. At this transition point, modular architecture
spontaneously emerges as a byproduct of the DD process.
  Results: Although the DD models lack any functionality and are thus free from
meeting functional constraints, they show the observed features displayed by
the real proteome maps when tuned close to a sharp transition point separating
a highly connected graph from a disconnected system. Close to such boundary,
the maps are shown to display scale-free hierarchical organization, behave as
small worlds and exhibit modularity.
  Conclusions: It is conjectured that natural selection tuned the average
connectivity in such a way that the network reaches a sparse graph of
connections. One consequence of such scenario is that the scaling laws and the
essential ingredients for building a modular net emerge for free close to such
transition.

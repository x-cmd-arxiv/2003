1913--2003 can be understood if the star is a member of an eccentric binary
that is encircled by a vertically thin, inclined ring of dusty gas. Eclipses
occur whenever the reflex motion of a star carries it behind the circumbinary
ring; the eclipses occur with period equal to the binary orbital period of 48.4
days. Features of the light curve--including the amplitude of central reversals
during mid-eclipse, the phase of eclipse with respect to the binary orbit
phase, the level of brightness out-of-eclipse, the depth of eclipse, and the
eclipse duty cycle--are all modulated on the timescale of nodal regression of
the obscuring ring, in accord with the historical data. The ring has a mean
radius near 3 AU and a radial width that is likely less than this value. While
the inner boundary could be shepherded by the central binary, the outer
boundary may require an exterior planet to confine it against viscous
spreading. The ring must be vertically warped to maintain a non-zero
inclination. Thermal pressure gradients and/or ring self-gravity can readily
enforce rigid precession. In coming years, as the node of the ring regresses
out of our line-of-sight toward the binary, the light curve from the system
should cycle approximately back through its previous behavior. Near-term
observations should seek to detect a mid-infrared excess from this system; we
estimate the flux densities from the ring to be 3 mJy at wavelengths of 10--100
microns.

ionized regions of the intergalactic medium. The simulations compute the energy
exchanges between ions, neutrals and electrons, without assuming thermal
equilibrium. They include gravitation, shock heating and cooling processes, and
follow self-consistently the chemical evolution of a primordial composition
hydrogen-helium plasma without assuming collisional ionization equilibrium. At
high redshift, a significant fraction of the intergalactic medium is found to
be warmer and weakly ionized in simulations with non-equipartition processes
than in simulations in which the cosmological plasma is considered to be in
thermodynamic equilibrium. With a semi-analytical study of the out of
equilibrium regions we show that, during the formation of cosmic structures,
departure from equilibrium in accreted plasma results from the competition
between the atomic cooling processes and the elastic processes between heavy
particles and electrons. Our numerical results are in agreement with this
semi-analytical model. Therefore, since baryonic matter with temperatures
around 10^4 K is a reservoir for galaxy formation, non-equipartition processes
are expected to modify the properties of the objects formed.

the cold gas is not centered on the central cD, but located near brightest
X-ray emitting regions along the North-West orientated radio lobe. The cold gas
kinematics is consistent with the optical nebulosity behaviour in the very

gradient shows the cold gas might be cooled gas from the intra-cluster medium
being accreted by the central galaxy. The optical filaments, aligned with the
cD orbit, are intimately related to the radio jets and lobes. The material
fueling the star formation certainly comes from the deposited gas, cooling more
efficiently along the edge of the radio lobes. Even if some heating mechanisms
are present, these millimetric observations show that an effective cooling to
very low temperatures indeed occurs and is probably accelerated by the presence

interpreted as support for the supranova model, where a massive star collapses
first to a supramassive neutron star, which later collapses to a black hole

population). Namely, we consider the dependence of their total luminosity
L_tot=SUM(L_k) and of fractional rms_tot of their variability on the number of
sources N or, equivalently, on the normalization of the luminosity function. We
show that due to small number statistics a regime exists, in which L_tot grows
non-linearly with N, in an apparent contradiction with the seemingly obvious
prediction <L_tot>=integral(dN/dL*L*dL) ~ N. In this non-linear regime, the
rms_tot decreases with N significantly more slowly than expected from the rms ~
1/sqrt(N) averaging law. For example, for a power law luminosity function with
a slope of a=3/2, in the non-linear regime, L_tot ~ N^2 and the rms_tot does
not depend at all on the number of sources N. Only in the limit of N>>1 do
these quantities behave as intuitively expected, L_tot ~ N and rms_tot ~
1/sqrt(N). We give exact solutions and derive convenient analytical
approximations for L_tot and rms_tot.
  Using the total X-ray luminosity of a galaxy due to its X-ray binary
population as an example, we show that the Lx-SFR and Lx-M* relations predicted
from the respective ``universal'' luminosity functions of high and low mass
X-ray binaries are in a good agreement with observations. Although caused by
small number statistics the non-linear regime in these examples extends as far

redshifts of 2 or greater and remains remarkably stable to the present time,
when considered in non-comoving coordinates. We fit our haloes to a 2 parameter
profile where the steepness of the asymptotic cusp is given by gamma, and its
radial extent is described by the concentration, c_gamma. In our simulations,
we find gamma = 1.4 - 0.08Log(M/M_*) for haloes of 0.01M_* to 1000M_*, with a
large scatter of gamma ~ +/-0.3$; and c_gamma = 8*M/M_*^{-0.15}, with a large
M/M_* dependent scatter roughly equal to +/- c_gamma. Our redshift zero haloes
have inner slope parameters ranging approximately from r^{-1} to r^{-1.5}, with
a median of roughly r^{-1.3}. This 2 parameter profile fit works well for all
our halo types, whether or not they show evidence of a steep asymptotic cusp.
We also model a cluster in power law cosmologies of P ~ k^n (n=0,-1,-2,-2.7).
We find larger concentration radii and shallower cusps for steeper n. The
minimum resolved radius is well described by the mean interparticle separation.
The trend of steeper and more concentrated cusps for smaller $M/M_*$ haloes
clearly shows that dwarf sized Lambda CDM haloes have, on average,
significantly steeper density profiles within the inner few percent of the

structure. The assembly of roughly 2L* of old stars into such a configuration
this early in the history of the universe is not easily explainable by any of
the currently popular scenarios for galaxy formation. A galaxy with these
properties would seem to require smooth but rapid infall of the large mass of
gas involved, followed by a burst of extremely vigorous and efficient star
formation in the resulting disk.

to the Hannay angle; it is thus emphasised that this effect is already
contained in classical celestial mechanics, although not yet defined nor
evaluated separately. Secondly, a more general expression of the Hannay angle,
valid for an action-dependent potential is given; such a generalised expression
takes into account that the restricted three-body problem is a time-dependent,
two degrees of freedom problem even when restricted to the circular motion of
the test body. Consequently, (some of) the eccentricity terms cannot be
neglected {\it a priori}. Thirdly, we present a new numerical estimate for the

derivation of the Hannay angle for the circular restricted three-body problem,
with an action-independent potential.

$z=3.57$. The nebula is extended over $\sim 30$ kpc from the nucleus, and forms
a pair of cones or elongated bubbles. The high-velocity ($\sim -1000$ km
s$^{-1}$; blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity)
Ly$\alpha$-emitting components are detected at both sides of the nucleus along
its major axis. The northwestern nebula is more spectacular in its velocity
shift (blueshifted by -1000 km s$^{-1}$ to -1400 km s$^{-1}$) and in its width

possible origin of the nebula; 1) the shock-heated expanding bubble or
outflowing cone associated with the superwind activity of the host galaxy, 2)
halo gas photoionized by the anisotropic radiation from the active galactic
nuclei (AGN), and 3) the jet-induced star-formation or shock. The last
possibility may not be likely because Ly$\alpha$ emission is distributed out of
the narrow channel of the radio jet. We show that the superwind model is most
plausible since it can explain both the characteristics of the morphology (size
and shape) and the kinematical structures (velocity shift and line width) of
the nebula although the photoionization by AGN may contribute to the excitation
to some extent.

study the properties of the intergalactic medium between redshifts z=2.0-2.9.
The high-quality optical spectrum allows us to identify approximately 850 HeII
absorption components with column densities between N~5X10^11 and $ 10^18
cm^-2. The reprocessed FUSE spectrum extends the wavelength coverage of the
HeII absorption down to an observed wavelength of 920 A. Approximately 1400
HeII absorption components are identified, including 917 HeII Ly-alpha systems
and some of their HeII Ly-beta, Ly-gamma, and Ly-delta counterparts. The
ionization structure of HeII is complex, with approximately 90 components that
are not detected in the hydrogen spectrum. These components may represent the
effect of soft ionizing sources. The ratio Eta=N(HeII)/N(HI) varies
approximately from unity to more than a thousand, with a median value of 62 and
a distribution consistent with the intrinsic spectral indices of quasars. This
suggests that the dominant ionizing field is from the accumulated quasar
radiation, with contributions from other soft sources such as star-forming
regions and obscured AGN, which do not ionize helium. We find an evolution in
Eta toward smaller values at lower redshift, with the gradual disappearance of
soft components. At redshifts z>2.7, the large but finite increase in the HeII
opacity, Tau=5+/-1, suggests that we are viewing the end stages of a
reionization process that began at an earlier epoch. Fits of the absorption
profiles of unblended lines indicate comparable velocities between hydrogen and
He^+ ions. At hydrogen column densities N<3X10^12 cm^-2 the number of forest
lines shows a significant deficit relative to a power law, and becomes
negligible below N=10^11 cm^-2.

  We focus on Ce- and U-based heavy fermion superconductors, in addition we
discuss the rare earth borocarbide and skutterudite superconductors. We show
that heavy fermion behaviour in Ce- and U- compounds should be described
differently. While the Kondo-lattice model with localised 4f-electrons is
appropriate for Ce-compounds, dual models including localised and itinerant
5f-electrons are necessary for U-compounds. We demonostrate that this leads to
consistent results for Fermi surface topology and mass enhancement in various
U-compounds. We also show that virtual exchange of localised 5f-electron
excitations provides a new mechanism for unconventional superconductivity in
addition to the known itinerant spin-fluctuation exchange mechanism. We discuss
symmetry properties and coexistence of unconventional superconducting and
density wave (hidden) order parameters and methods for their detection, notably
the new angle resolved magntetotransport methods. The latter have been very
succesful for the investigtion of gap anisotropies in the nonmagnetic
borocarbide superconductors. Recent results on the new multiphase
Pr-skutterudite superconductor are also reviewed.

performed in order to study the dynamics of dense pyroclastic flows. The plane
is rough, and always wider than the flow, focusing this study on the case of
laterally unconfined (free boundary) flows.We found that several flow regimes
exist depending on the input fluxand on the inclination of the plane. Each flow
regime corresponds to a particular morphology of the associated deposit. In one
of these regimes, the flow reaches a steady state, and the deposit exhibits a
levee/channel morphology similar to those observed on small pyroclastic flow
deposits. The levees result from the combination between lateral static zones
on each border of the flow and the drainage of the central part of the flow
after the supply stops. Particle segregation featuresare created during the
flow, corresponding to those observed on the deposits of pyroclastic flows.
Moreover, the measurements of the deposit morphology (thickness of the channel,
height of the levees, width of the deposit) are quantitatively related to
parameters of the dynamics of the flow (flux, velocity, height of the flow),
leading to a way of studying the flow dynamics from only measurements of the
deposit. Some attempts to make extensions to natural cases are discussed
through experiments introducing the polydispersity of the particle sizes and
the particle segregation process.

study the c-axis penetration depth as a function of temperature and doping. The

doesn't use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as
follows: First, we determine a universal similarity distance, the normalized
compression distance or NCD, computed from the lengths of compressed data files
(singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical
clustering method. The NCD is universal in that it is not restricted to a
specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A
theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one
of the authors, is provably optimal but uses the non-computable notion of
Kolmogorov complexity. We propose precise notions of similarity metric, normal
compressor, and show that the NCD based on a normal compressor is a similarity
metric that approximates universality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from
the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (binary tree) by a new quartet
method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and
available as public software, and is robust under choice of different
compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we
report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics,
virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and
combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical,
dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics we presented new

Universe in the framework of the five-dimensional Projective Unified Field
Theory in which gravitation is described by both space-time curvature and some
hypothetical scalar field (sigma-field). It is shown that the presence of the
sigma-field can essentially affect conclusions obtained from the cosmological
tests. The surface brightness-redshift relation can be used as a critical test
for sigma-field effects. It seems reasonable to say that the available
experimental data testify that the sigma-field decreases with time. It is
concluded that the spatial curvature is positive or negative depending on
whether the mass density is larger or smaller than some critical parameter
which is smaller than the critical density and can even take negative values.
It is shown that the increase in the number of the observational cosmological
parameters as compared to the standard Friedmann model can essentially
facilitate coordination of the existing observational data.

and vector-like charge 2/3 quarks, whose couplings to the Higgs greatly reduce
the UV sensitivity of the Higgs potential. Stabilization of the Higgs mass
squared parameter, without finetuning, occurs due to a softly broken shift
symmetry--the Higgs is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson. Above the 10 TeV scale
the theory has new strongly coupled interactions. A perturbatively
renormalizable UV completion, with softly broken supersymmetry at 10 TeV is
explicitly worked out. Our theory contains new particles which are odd under an
exact ""dark matter parity"", (-1)^{(2S+3B+L)}. We argue that such a parity is
likely to be a feature of many theories of new TeV scale physics. The lightest
parity odd particle, or ""LPOP"", is most likely a neutral fermion, and may make
a good dark matter candidate, with similar experimental signatures to the
neutralino of the MSSM. We give a general effective field theory analysis of
the calculation of corrections to precision electroweak observables.

Thus, tau neutrinos cross the Earth without being absorbed, though loosing

Neutrinos of all flavors can be detected in deep underwater/ice detectors by

facilitates the calculation of the relative probability (or probability

of a given 'duration' might have on the twice punctured plane (the plane with
two marked points). The result is expressed as a scattering series of integrals
of increasing dimensionality based on the maximally shrunk version of the path.
Physically, this applies in different contexts: (i) the topology probability of
a closed ideal polymer chain on a plane with two impassable points, (ii) the
trace of the Schroedinger Green function, and thence spectral information, in
the presence of two Aharonov-Bohm fluxes, (iii) the same with two branch points
of a Riemann surface instead of fluxes. Our theorem starts with the Stovicek
expansion for the Green function in the presence of two Aharonov-Bohm flux
lines, which itself is based on the famous Sommerfeld one puncture point
solution of 1896 (the one puncture case has much easier topology, just one
winding number). Stovicek's expansion itself can supply the results at the
expense of choosing a base point on the loop and then integrating it away. The
shrunk loop theorem eliminates this extra two dimensional integration,
distilling the topology from the geometry.

equations, standing for the {\it Euler-Poincar\'e equations associated with the

Our main focus will be on the case of quadratic Lagrangians; that is, on
geodesic motion on the diffeomorphism group with respect to the right invariant
Sobolev $H^1$ metric. The corresponding Euler-Poincar\'e (EP) equations are the
EPDiff equations, which coincide with the averaged template matching equations
(ATME) from computer vision and agree with the Camassa-Holm (CH) equations in
one dimension. The corresponding equations for the volume preserving
diffeomorphism group are the well-known LAE (Lagrangian averaged Euler)
equations for incompressible fluids. We first show that the EPDiff equations
are generated by a smooth vector field on the diffeomorphism group for
sufficiently smooth solutions. This is analogous to known results for
incompressible fluids--both the Euler equations and the LAE equations--and it
shows that for sufficiently smooth solutions, the equations are well-posed for
short time. In fact, numerical evidence suggests that, as time progresses,
these smooth solutions break up into singular solutions which, at least in one
dimension, exhibit soliton behavior. With regard to these non-smooth solutions,
we study measure-valued solutions that generalize to higher dimensions the
peakon solutions of the (CH) equation in one dimension. One of the main
purposes of this paper is to show that many of the properties of these
measure-valued solutions may be understood through the fact that their solution
ansatz is a momentum map. Some additional geometry is also pointed out, for
example, that this momentum map is one leg of a natural dual pair.

for atom waves. However, atomic diffraction patterns formed using material
gratings indicate that material structures also operate as phase masks. In this
study a well collimated beam of sodium atoms is used to illuminate a silicon
nitride grating with a period of 100 nm. During passage through the grating
slots atoms acquire a phase shift due to the van der Waals interaction with the
grating walls. As a result the relative intensities of the matter-wave
diffraction peaks deviate from those expected for a purely absorbing grating.
Thus a complex transmission function is required to explain the observed
diffraction envelopes. An optics perspective to the theory of atomic
diffraction from material gratings is put forth in the hopes of providing a
more intuitive picture concerning the influence of the vdW potential. The van
der Waals coefficient $C_{3} = 2.7\pm 0.8{meV nm}^{3}$ is determined by fitting
a modified Fresnel optical theory to the experimental data. This value of
$C_{3}$ is consistent with a van der Waals interaction between atomic sodium

efficiency and dark count of single-photon detector. It is found that a high
fidelity is achievable with small enough squeezing parameters and coherent
state amplitudes.

through a noisy quantum channel relies on the ability to distill a shorter
secure key sequence from a longer insecure one. We show that -- for protocols
that use quantum channels of any dimension and completely characterize them by
state tomography -- the noise threshold for classical advantage distillation is
substantially lower than the threshold for quantum entanglement distillation
because the eavesdropper can perform powerful coherent attacks. The earlier
claims that the two noise thresholds are identical, which were based on
analyzing incoherent attacks only, are therefore invalid.

spin-correlation measurement of the $^1S_0$ two-proton state produced in
12C(d,2He) reaction at the KVI, Groningen. We show that in the presence of the
unpolarized state the maximal violation of the CHSH-Bell inequality is lower
than the classical limit if the purity of the state is less than $ \sim
\verb+70%+$. In particular, for the KVI experiment the violation of the
CHSH-Bell inequality should be corrected by a factor $\sim\verb+10%+$ from the
pure $^1S_0$ state.

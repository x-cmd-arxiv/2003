spiral galaxies, through analysis of the radial variation of the offset between
arms traced by the potential (P-arms) and those traced by dust (D-arms). We
have verified the predictions of semi-analytical theory through hydrodynamical
simulations and have examined the uniqueness of the galactic parameters that
can be deduced by this method. We find that if the range of angular offsets
measured at different radii in a galaxy is greater than around pi/4, it is
possible to locate the radius of corotation to within ~ 25%. We argue that the
relative location of the P- and D-arms provides more robust constraints on the
galactic parameters than can be inferred from regions of enhanced star
formation (SF-arms), since interpretation of the latter involves uncertainties
due to reddening and the assumed star formation law. We thus stress the
importance of K-band studies of spiral galaxies.

NGC6285/86 carried out with the 6m SAO RAS telescope by using 1D and 2D
spectroscopy. The observations of NGC6286 with a long-slit spectrograph (UAGS)
near the H-alpha line revealed the rotation of the gaseous disk around an axis
offset by 5''-7'' from the photometric center and a luminous gas at a distance
up to 9 kpc in a direction perpendicular to the galactic plane. Using a
multipupil fiber spectrograph (MPFS), we constructed the velocity fields of the
stellar and gaseous components in the central region of this galaxy, which
proved to be similar. The similar line-of-sight velocities of the pair and the
wide (5'x 5') field of view of the scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer (IFP)
allowed us to obtain images in the H-alpha and [NII]6583 emission lines and in
the continuum as well as to construct the line-of-sight velocity fields and to
map the distribution of the [NII]6583/H-alpha ratio for both galaxies
simultaneously. Based on these data, we studied the gas kinematics in the
galaxies, constructed their rotation curves, and estimated their masses. We
found no evidence of gas rotation around the major axis of NGC6286, which
argues against the assumption that this galaxy has a forming polar ring. The
IFP observations revealed an emission nebula around this galaxy with a
structure characteristic for superwind galaxies. The large [NII]6583/H-alpha
ratio, which suggests the collisional excitation of its emission, and the high
infrared luminosity are additional arguments for the hypothesis of a superwind
in the galaxy NGC 6286. A close encounter of the two galaxies was probably
responsible for the starburst and the bipolar outflow of hot gas from the
central region of the disk.

survey in our select group of nine radio surveys, doubling our sample of radio
pulsars. We adopted with some modifications the radio beam geometry of
Arzoumanian, Chernoff & Cordes (2002). For the $\gamma$-ray beam, we have
assumed the slot gap geometry described in the work of Muslimov & Harding
(2003). To account for the shape of the distribution of radio pulsars in the
$\dot P-P$ diagram, we continue to find that decay of the magnetic field on a
timescale of 2.8 Myr is needed. With all nine surveys, our model predicts that
EGRET should have seen 7 radio-quiet (below the sensitivity of these radio
surveys) and 19 radio-loud $\gamma$-ray pulsars. AGILE (nominal sensitivity
map) is expected to detect 13 radio-quiet and 37 radio-loud $\gamma$-ray
pulsars, while GLAST, with greater sensitivity is expected to detect 276
radio-quiet and 344 radio-loud $\gamma$-ray pulsars. When the Parkes multi-beam
pulsar survey is excluded, the ratio of radio-loud to radio-quiet $\gamma$-ray
pulsars decreases, especially for GLAST. The decrease for EGRET is 45%,
implying that some fraction of EGRET unidentified sources are radio-loud
$\gamma$-ray pulsars. In the radio geometry adopted, short period pulsars are
core dominated. Unlike the EGRET $\gamma$-ray pulsars, our model predicts that
when two $\gamma$-ray peaks appear in the pulse profile, a dominant radio core
peak appears in between the $\gamma$-ray peaks. Our findings suggest that
further improvements are required in describing both the radio and $\gamma$-ray

the case of 1/f noise for which we introduce and study a model of an

terms of a suitable harmonic oscillator environment and the explicit mapping on

various computation procedures (single shot measurements, repeated

the effect of the environment. For a fluctuator environment with 1/f spectrum
memory effects turn out to be important. Although in general information beyond
the power spectrum is needed, in many situations this results in the knowledge
of only one more microscopic parameter of the environment. This allows to
determine which degrees of freedom of the environment are effective sources of
decoherence in each different physical situation considered.

radiation-dominated era. We argue that in general the velocity of interfaces is
non-relativistic due to the interaction with the plasma and the release of
latent heat. We study the general evolution of such slow phase transitions,
which comprise essentially a short reheating stage and a longer phase
equilibrium stage. We perform a completely analytical description of both
stages. Some rough approximations are needed for the first stage, due to the
non-trivial relations between the quantities that determine the variation of
temperature with time. The second stage, instead, is considerably simplified by
the fact that it develops at a constant temperature, close to the critical one.
Indeed, in this case the equations can be solved exactly, including
back-reaction on the expansion of the Universe. This treatment also applies to
phase transitions mediated by impurities. We also investigate the relations
between the different parameters that govern the characteristics of the phase
transition and its cosmological consequences, and discuss the dependence of
these parameters with the particle content of the theory.

observables in photonuclear reactions; we discuss in detail $\eta$- and
vector-meson production. We show that photoproduction of $\eta$'s can yield
essential information on in-medium properties of the $S_{11}(1535)$ resonance
while the $\phi$ meson properties will probably not be accessible through the
$K^+K^-$ decay channel. However, for $\omega$ mesons the $\pi^0\gamma$ decay
channel, due to its reduced final state interaction, looks more promising in
this respect. Completely free of final state interactions is dilepton
production in the few GeV range. We show that the sensitivity of this decay
channel to changes of hadronic properties in medium in photonuclear reactions
on nuclei is as large as in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. Finally we
discuss that hadron production in nuclei at 10 -- 20 GeV photon energies can
give important information on the hadronization process.

that correspond to the unstable states. These vectors are the generalized
eigenvectors (kets in the rigged Hilbert space) with complex eigenvalues of the

provides an acceptable fit to the WMAP data for the power spectrum of
temperature fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation (CBR). An a priori
prediction of such no-CDM models was a first-to-second peak amplitude ratio
A1:2 = 2.4. WMAP measures A1:2 = 2.34 +/- 0.09. The baryon content is the
dominant factor in fixing this ratio; no-CDM models which are consistent with
the WMAP data are also consistent with constraints on the baryon density from
the primordial abundances of 2H, 4He, and 7Li. However, in order to match the
modest width of the acoustic peaks observed by WMAP, a substantial neutrino
mass is implied: m(nu) ~ 1 eV. Even with such a heavy neutrino, structure is
expected to form rapidly under the influence of MOND. Consequently, the epoch
of reionization should occur earlier than is nominally expected in LCDM. This
prediction is realized in the polarization signal measured by WMAP. An
outstanding test is in the amplitude of the third acoustic peak. Experiments
which probe high-L appear to favor a third peak which is larger than predicted
by the no-CDM model.

photons. Our argument assumes that the reionization ended around z ~ 6 and that
it was a relatively quick process, i.e., that there was a non-negligible
fraction of neutral hydrogen in the Universe at somewhat earlier epochs.
Starting from our earlier estimate of the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies
at z ~ 6, we quantitatively show that the major sources of reionization are
most likely galaxies with L < L*. Our approach allows us to put stronger
constraints to the LF of galaxies at z ~ 6. To have the Universe completely
ionized at this redshift, the faint-end slope of the LF should be steeper than
$\alpha=-1.6$, which is the value measured at lower redshifts (z ~ 3), unless
either the normalization (Phi*) of the LF or the clumping factor of the ionized
hydrogen has been significantly underestimated. If Phi* is actually lower than
what we assumed by a factor of two, a steep slope close to $\alpha=-2.0$ is
required. Our LF predicts a total of 50 -- 80 z ~ 6 galaxies in the HST Ultra
Deep Field (UDF) to a depth of AB=28.4 mag, which can be used to constraint
both Phi* and $\alpha$. We conclude that the least luminous galaxies existing
at this redshift should reach as low as some critical luminosity in order to
accumulate the entire reionizing photon budget. On the other hand, the
existence of significant amounts of neutral hydrogen at slightly earlier
epochs, e.g. z ~ 7, requires that the least luminous galaxies should not be
fainter than another critical value (i.e., the LF should cut-off at this
point).

increase the density there, and plays an important role in the formation of the

the Orion star-forming region. We analyze the system spectroscopically and
photometrically to empirically determine precise, distance-independent masses,
radii, effective temperatures, and luminosities for both components. The
measured masses for the primary and secondary, accurate to ~1%, are 1.01 Msun
and 0.73 Msun, respectively; thus the primary is a definitive pre-main-sequence
solar analog, and the secondary is the lowest-mass star yet discovered among
pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary systems. We use these fundamental
measurements to test the predictions of pre-main-sequence stellar evolutionary
tracks. None of the models we examined correctly predict the masses of the two
components simultaneously, and we implicate differences between the theoretical
and empirical effective temperature scales for this failing. All of the models
predict the observed slope of the mass-radius relationship reasonably well,
though the observations tend to favor models with low convection efficiencies.
Indeed, considering our newly determined mass measurements together with other
dynamical mass measurements of pre-main-sequence stars in the literature, as
well as measurements of Li abundances in these stars, we show that the data
strongly favor evolutionary models with inefficient convection in the stellar
interior, even though such models cannot reproduce the properties of the

P=9.5 min; ES Cet, P=10.3 min; RX J0806.3+1527, P=5.3 min) with properties that
suggest that their photometric periods are also their orbital periods, making
them the most compact binary stars known. If true, this might indicate that
close, detached, double white dwarfs are able to survive the onset of mass
transfer caused by gravitational wave radiation and emerge as the
semi-detached, hydrogen-deficient stars known as the AM CVn stars. The
accreting white dwarfs in such systems are large compared to the orbital
separations. This has two effects: first it makes it likely that the mass
transfer stream can hit the accretor directly, and second it causes a loss of
angular momentum from the orbit which can destabilise the mass transfer unless
the angular momentum lost to the accretor can be transferred back to the orbit.
The effect of the destabilisation is to reduce the number of systems which
survive mass transfer by as much as one hundred-fold. In this paper we analyse
this destabilisation and the stabilising effect of a dissipative torque between
the accretor and the binary orbit. We obtain analytic criteria for the
stability of both disc-fed and direct impact accretion, and carry out numerical
integrations to assess the importance of secondary effects, the chief one being
that otherwise stable systems can exceed the Eddington accretion rate. We show
that to have any effect upon survival rates, the synchronising torque must act
on a timescale of order 1000 years or less. If synchronisation torques are this
strong, then they will play a significant role in the spin rates of white
dwarfs in cataclysmic variable stars as well.

the density fluctuation spectra $N({\bf q},\omega)$ are determined by an

corrections introduce the polaron character of the bosonic holes moving in a

an illustrative model problem: a growing filament with preferred twist, closed
into a loop. Growth depletes the twist, inducing a twist strain. The closure of
the loop prevents the filament from unwinding back to the preferred twist;
instead, twist relaxation is accomplished by the formation of supercoils.
Growth also produces viscous stresses on the filament which even in the absence
of twist produce buckling instabilities. Our linear stability analysis and
numerical studies reveal two dynamic regimes. For small intrinsic twist the
instability is akin to Euler buckling, leading to solenoidal structures, while
for large twist it is like the classic writhing of a twisted filament,
producing plectonemic windings. This model may apply to situations in which
supercoils form only, or more readily, when axial rotation of filaments is
blocked. Applications to specific biological systems are proposed.

an exact ground state and differs from the t-J and Hubbard Hamiltonians in

Cooper pairing in the d-wave channel. It is a faithful description for a
superconductor with strong on-site electronic repulsion. The superconducting
tunneling gap remains intact and despite on-site repulsion. Near half-filling
the Gossamer superconductor with strong repulsion has suppressed photoemission
intensities and superfluid density, is unstable toward an antiferromagnetic
insulator and possesses an incipient Mott-Hubbard gap. The Gossamer technique
can be applied to metallic ground states thus possibly serving as an apt
description of strongly correlated metals. Such a Gossamer metallic phase, just
as the Gossamer superconducting one, becomes arbitrarily hard to differentiate
from an insulator as one turns the Coulomb correlations up near half-filling.
Both the metallic and superconducting states undergo a quantum phase transition

fully projecting out the double occupancy. Such a critical point might be the

hydrodynamics code, which treats gravity in the conformally flat (CF) limit.
The evolution of fluid configurations is described using smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH), and the elliptic field equations of the CF formalism are
solved using spectral methodsin spherical coordinates. The code was tested on
models for which the CF limit is exact, finding good agreement with the
classical Oppenheimer-Volkov solution for a relativistic static spherical star
as well as the exact semi-analytic solution for a collapsing spherical dust
cloud. By computing the evolution of quasi-equilibrium neutron star binary
configurations in the absence of gravitational radiation backreaction, we have
confirmed that these configurations can remain dynamically stable all the way
to the development of a cusp. With an approximate treatment of radiation
reaction, we have calculated the complete merger of an irrotational binary
configuration from the innermost point on an equilibrium sequence through
merger and remnant formation and ringdown, finding good agreement withprevious
relativistic calculations. In particular, we find that mass loss is highly
suppressed by relativistic effects, but that, for a reasonably stiff neutron
star equation of state, the remnant is initially stable against gravitational
collapse because of its strong differential rotation. The gravity wave signal
derived from our numerical calculation has an energy spectrum which matches
extremely well with estimates based solely on quasi-equilibrium results,

gravitomagnetic monopole at rest can produce a stationary gravitomagnetic

spacetime where the gravitomagnetic matter is present will be nonanalytic. In
this paper both the dual curvature tensors (which can characterize the dynamics
of gravitational charge/monopoles) and the antisymmetric gravitational field
equation of gravitomagnetic matter are presented. We consider and discuss the
mathematical formulation and physical properties of the dual curvature tensors
and scalar, antisymmetric source tensors, dual spin connection (including the
low-motion weak-field approximation), dual vierbein field as well as dual
current densities of gravitomagnetic charge. It is shown that the dynamics of
gravitomagnetic charge can be founded within the framework of the above dual
quantities. In addition, the dual relationship between the dynamical theories
of gravitomagnetic charge (dual mass) and gravitoelectric charge (mass) is also
taken into account in the present paper.

a complex neutral gauge boson $Y^0$ and a singly-charged gauge boson $Y^\pm$.
The mass of these gauge bosons, called bileptons, is expected to be in the
range of a few hundreds of GeV according to the current bounds from
experimental data. If the bilepton masses are of the order of 200 GeV, the size
of their contribution is similar to that obtained in other weakly coupled
theories. However the contributions to both $\Delta Q$ and $\Delta \kappa$ are
negligible for very heavy or degenerate bileptons. As for the scalar sector, an
scenario is examined in which the contribution to the $W$ form factors is
identical to that of a two-Higgs-doublet model. It is found that this sector
would not give large corrections to $\Delta \kappa$ and $\Delta Q$.

the gauge group SU(2)x$U(1) and N_f=4 flavors of fundamental hypermultiplets
(referred to as quarks), perturbed by the Fayet-Iliopoulos term of the U(1)
factor. In the limit of large but almost equal quark mass terms a set of vacua
exists in which this theory is at weak coupling. We focus on these vacua
(called the quark vacua). We study elementary BPS domain walls interpolating
between selected quark vacua, as well as their bound state, a composite wall.
The composite wall is demonstrated to localize a non-Abelian gauge field on its
world sheet. Next, we turn to the analysis of recently proposed ""non-Abelian""
strings (flux tubes) which carry orientational moduli corresponding to
rotations of the ""color-magnetic"" flux direction inside a global O(3). We find

As an illustration, we consider the BPS $D$-brane of the type II superstring in
a constant NS-NS two-form background, and study the boundary interaction with
arbitrary configurations of gauge field on the brane. The boundary interaction
is presented, within the world-sheet cut-off theories, as an off-shell boundary
state in the closed-string Hilbert space. It is regarded as a closed-string
theoretical counterpart of the Wilson loop in the world-volume gauge theory. We
show that the action of the closed-string BRST operator on the boundary state
is translated into the non-linear BRST transformation of the open-string fields
on the world-volume. In particular, the BRST invariance condition at the
$\alpha'$-order becomes the non-linear equation of motion for the
non-commutative gauge theory. The action of the closed-string BRST operator on

for positive as well as negative bulk gravitational constant. In the zero-mode
approximation, we derive the linearized gravitational equations, which have the
same form as in the original Randall-Sundrum model but with different
expressions for the effective physical constants. We develop a generic method
for finding tachyonic modes in the theory, which, in the model under
consideration, may exist only if the bulk gravitational constant is negative.
In this case, if both brane gravitational constants are nonzero, the theory
contains one or two tachyonic mass eigenvalues in the gravitational sector. If
one of the brane gravitational constants is set to zero, then either a single
tachyonic mass eigenvalue is present or tachyonic modes are totally absent
depending on the relation between the nonzero brane gravitational constant and
brane separation. In the case of negative bulk gravitational constant, the
massive gravitational modes have ghost-like character, while the massless
gravitational mode is not a ghost in the case where tachyons are absent.

problem for realistic nuclear forces is expected to possess a high degree of
predictive power. In this contribution we treat the main obstacle, namely the
short-ranged repulsive and tensor correlations induced by the realistic
nucleon-nucleon interaction, by means of a unitary correlation operator. This
correlator applied to uncorrelated many-body states imprints short-ranged
correlations that cannot be described by product states. When applied to an
observable it induces the correlations into the operator, creating for example
a correlated Hamiltonian suited for Slater determinants. Adding to the
correlated realistic interaction a correction for three-body effects,
consisting of a momentum-dependent central and spin-orbit two-body potential we
obtain an effective interaction that is successfully used for all nuclei up to
mass 60. Various results are shown.

scattering cross sections ($\sigma_{np}^{*}$, $\sigma_{pp(nn)}^{*}$) are
studied based on the effective Lagrangian of density dependent relativistic
hadron theory in which the $\delta$[$a_0(980)$] meson is included. Our study
shows that at low densities the $\sigma_{np}^*$ is about 3-4 times larger than
$\sigma_{pp(nn)}^*$ and at densities higher than the normal density the isospin
effect is almost washed out. Because of coupling to $\delta$ meson the
$\sigma_{nn}^*$ and $\sigma_{pp}^*$ are different in isospin asymmetric medium
following the splitting of the proton and neutron mass. The isospin effect on
the density dependence of the in-medium nucleon elastic cross section is
dominantly contributed by the isovector $\delta$ and $\rho$ mesons. The
temperature effect on the $\sigma_{np}^*$ and $\sigma_{pp(nn)}^*$ is studied.
It is shown that the temperature effect is weaker compared with the density
effect but it becomes obvious as density increases.

rotation of a rotating axisymmetric container. For small forcing, this produces
a shear layer, which has been studied by Stewartson and is almost invariant
along the rotation axis. When the forcing increases, instabilities develop. To
study the asymptotic regime (very low Ekman number $E$), we develop a
quasi-geostrophic two-dimensional model, whose main original feature is to
handle the mass conservation correctly, resulting in a divergent
two-dimensional flow, and valid for any container provided that the top and
bottom have finite slopes. We use it to derive scalings and asymptotic laws by
a simple linear theory, extending the previous analyses to large slopes (as in
a sphere), for which we find different scaling laws. For a flat container, the
critical Rossby number for the onset of instability evolves as $E^{3/4}$ and
may be understood as a Kelvin-Helmoltz shear instability. For a sloping
container, the instability is a Rossby wave with a critical Rossby number
proportional to $\beta E^{1/2}$, where $\beta$ is related to the slope. We also
investigate the asymmetry between positive and negative differential rotation
and propose corrections for finite Ekman and Rossby numbers. Implemented in a
numerical code, our model allows us to study the onset over a broad range of
parameters, determining the threshold but also other features such as the
spatial structure. We also present a few experimental results, validating our
model and showing its limits.

distribution) of pH-sensitive spin label
4-amino-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-imidazoline-N-oxyl (ATI) depend on protonation
and aqueous surroundings. Our calculations demonstrate that ATI protonation
should occur at the nitrogen atom of the imidazoline ring rather than at the
amino group. Protonation of ATI leads to a decrease in a spin density on the
nitrogen atom of the nitroxide fragment >N-O. For simulation of ATI hydration
effects, we have constructed a water shell around a spin label molecule by
means of gradual (step-by-step) surrounding of ATI with water molecules (n =
2-41). Calculated spin density on the nitrogen atom of the nitroxide fragment
increased with an extension of a water shell around ATI. Both protonation and
hydration of ATI caused certain changes in calculated geometric parameters
(bond lengths and valence angles). Investigating how structural and energy
parameters of a system ATI-(H2O)n depend on a number of surrounding water
molecules, we came to the conclusion that a hydrogen-bonded cluster of n
&#8805; 41 water molecules could be considered as an appropriate model for
simulation of ATI hydration effects.

electron coherence (dephasing) in solids and in vacuum electron beam
interference. The vacuum fluctuations are modified by conductors and
dielectrics, as in the Casimir effect, and hence, bodies in the vicinity of the
beams can influence the beam coherence. We calculate the quenching of
interference of two beams moving in vacuum parallel to a thick plate with
permittivity $\epsilon(\omega)=\epsilon_{0}+i 4\pi\sigma/\omega$. In case of an
ideal conductor or dielectric $(|\epsilon|=\infty)$ the dephasing is suppressed
when the beams are close to the surface of the plate, because the random
tangential electric field $E_{t}$, responsible for dephasing, is zero at the
surface. The situation is changed dramatically when
  $\epsilon_{0}$ or $\sigma$ are finite. In this case there exists a layer near
the surface, where the fluctuations of $E_{t}$ are strong due to evanescent
near fields. The thickness of this near - field layer is of the order of the
wavelength in the dielectric or the skin depth in the conductor, corresponding
to a frequency which is the inverse electron time of flight from the emitter to
the detector. When the beams are within this layer their dephasing is enhanced
and for slow enough electrons can be even stronger than far from the surface.

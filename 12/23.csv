study the impact of AGN outbursts on its gaseous atmosphere. Many X-ray
features appear to be a direct result of repetitive AGN outbursts. In
particular, the X-ray cavities around the jet and counter jet are likely due to
the expansion of radio plasma, while rings of enhanced emission at 14 and 17
kpc are probably shock fronts associated with outbursts that began
1-2\times10^7 years ago. The effects of these shocks are also seen in
brightenings within the prominent X-ray arms. On larger scales, ~50 kpc from
the nucleus, depressions in the surface brightness may be remnants of earlier
outbursts. As suggested for the Perseus cluster (Fabian et al.), our analysis
of the energetics of the M87 outbursts argues that shocks may be the most
significant channel for AGN energy input into the cooling flow atmospheres of
galaxies, groups, and clusters. For M87, the mean power driving the shock
outburst, 2.4\times 10^{43} ergs/sec, is three times greater than the radiative
losses from the entire ``cooling flow''. Thus, even in the absence of other
energy inputs, outbursts every 3\times10^7 years are sufficient to quench the
flow.

formed in the outflows that accompany the evolution of protostars and so are
ideal to use as a comparison to confirm that the measured offsets in the Pab

explaining the origin of atomic hydrogen emission lines. Yet we see that the
line profiles of the sources showing displacement in their Pab emission all
have features that the magnetospheric accretion model has so far failed to
explain, such as broad full width half maxima, large wings and an absence of
red shifted absorption features. The failure of the models to explain the
presence of large extended wings in the line profiles is particularly
interesting in the context of this study as in all cases it is in the extended

stars (NSs) with Hydrogen atmospheres and an underlying layer of proton
capturing nuclei. Our initial study showed that DNB can alter the photospheric
abundance of Hydrogen on surprisingly short timescales ($10^{2-4}\yrs$).
Significant composition evolution impacts the radiated thermal spectrum from
the NS as well as its overall cooling rate. In this paper, we consider the case
when the rate limiting step for the H consumption is diffusion to the burning
layer, rather than the local nuclear timescale. This is relevant for NSs with
surface temperatures in excess of $10^6 {\rm K}$, such as young ($<10^5$ yr)
radio pulsars and accreting NSs in quiescence. When downward diffusion is the
limiting rate in DNB, the rate of H consumption is suppressed by 1-2 orders of
magnitude compared to a DNB estimate that assumes diffusive equilibrium. In
order to apply our ongoing study to young neutron stars, we also include the
important effects of strong magnetic fields ($B \sim 10^{12} {\rm G}$). In this
initial study of magnetic modifications to DNB, we find that the H burning time
is lengthened by 2-3 orders of magnitude for a $10^{12} {\rm G}$ field.
However, even for NSs with dipole field strengths of $10^{12}$ G, we find that
all of the H can be burned before the pulsar reaches an age of $\sim 10^5 \

Finally, we conclude by providing an overview of what can be learned about

point mass. Using a normal mode decomposition we calculate the evolution of the
primary angular velocity and orbit for arbitrary eccentricity e. The
dissipation acting on the tidal perturbation is associated with convective
turbulence. A novel feature of the Paper is that, to take into account of the
fact that there is a relaxation time t_{c}, being the turn-over time of
convective eddies, associated with the process, this is allowed to act non
locally in time, producing a dependence of the dissipation on tidal forcing
frequency. Results are expressed in terms of the Fourier coefficients of the
tidal potential. We find analytical approximations for these valid for $e>0.2$.
When the tidal response is frequency independent, our results are equivalent to
those obtained in the standard constant time lag approximation. When there is
the frequency dependence of the dissipative response, the evolution can differ
drastically. In that case the system can evolve through a sequence of
spin-orbit corotation resonances with Omega_{r}/Omega_{orb}=n/2, where
Omega_{r} and Omega_{orb} are the rotation and orbital frequencies and n is an
integer. We study this case analytically and numerically.

perturbed by a complex variable component. The early- and late-time decay
slopes are determined to be ~1.1 and ~2, respectively. Assuming this single
power-law model, we constrain the break to lie between ~3 and ~8 days after the

analysis of our optical observations, may also account for available multi-band
data, provided that the break happened ~8 days after the burst. The more
complex double-jet model of Berger et al. provides a comparable fit to the
optical, X-ray, mm and radio observations of this event. We detect a
significant change in optical colors during the first day. Our color analysis
is consistent with a cooling break frequency sweeping through the optical band
during the first day. The light curves of GRB 030329 reveal a rich array of
variations, superposed over the mean power-law decay. We find that the early
variations are asymmetric, with a steep rise followed by a relatively slower
(by a factor of about two) decline. The variations maintain a similar time
scale during the first four days, and then get significantly longer.

evolution is not simply a scaled-up version of low mass star formation.
Outflows and radiative effects strongly hinder the formation of massive stars
via accretion. A necessary condition for accretion growth of a hydrostatic
object up to high masses M > 20 M_sun (rather than coalescence of optically
thick objects) is the formation of and accretion through a circumstellar disk.
Once the central object has accreted approximately 10 M_sun it has already
evolved to core hydrogen-burning; the resultant main sequence star continues to
accrete material as it begins to photoevaporate its circumstellar disk (and any
nearby disks) on a timescale of 100,000 years, similar to the accretion
timescale. Until the disk(s) is (are) completely photoevaporated, this
configuration is observable as an ultra-compact HII region (UCHII). The final
mass of the central star (and any nearby neighboring systems) is determined by
the interplay between radiation acceleration, UV photoevaporation, stellar
winds and outflows, and the accretion through the disk.
  Several aspects of this evolutionary sequence have been simulated
numerically, resulting in a ""proof of concept"". This scenario places strong
constraints on the accretion rate necessary to produce high mass stars and
offers an opportunity to test the accretion hypothesis.

observed in photoemission experiments on electron-doped cuprates. Here this
approach is extended in a number of ways. RPA, mode coupling (via
self-consistent renormalization), and (to a limited extent) self-consistent
Born approximation calculations are compared to assess the roles of hot-spot
fluctuations and interaction with spin waves. When fluctuations are included,
the calculation satisfies the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and the mean-field gap and
transition temperature are replaced by pseudogap and onset temperature. The
model is in excellent agreement with experiments on the doping dependence of
both photoemission dispersion and magnetic properties. The magnetic phase
terminates in a quantum critical point (QCP), with a natural phase boundary for
this QCP arising from hot-spot physics.
  Since the resulting T=0 antiferromagnetic transition is controlled by a
generalized Stoner factor, an ansatz is made of dividing the Stoner factor up
into a material-dependent part, the bare susceptibility and a
correlation-dependent part, the Hubbard U, which depends only weakly on doping.
  From the material dependent part of the interaction, it is possible to
explain the striking differences between electron- and hole-doping, despite an
approximate symmetry in the doping of the QCP. The slower divergence of the
magnetic correlation length in hole doped cuprates may be an indication of more

spectrum of the symmetric dimer are extended to the asymmetric version of the

Based on a previous systematic study of the mean-field limit of the trimer,
where the dynamics is exhaustively described in terms of its fixed points for
every choice of the significant parameters, an interesting mapping between the
dimer and the trimer is emphasized and used as a guide in investigating the
persistence of mean-field features in the rather complex energy spectrum of the

purely quantum trimer extending and completing the existing mean-field
analysis. In this respect we recall that, similar to larger arrays, the trimer

trajectories. Hence, the correspondence between mean-field fixed points and

prepared identically to those that show no magnetic order. The NPD measurements
show that the long-range structure of Tb2Ti2O7 is well ordered with no
structural transitions between 4.5 and 600 K. In articular, mean-squared
displacements (u^2's) for each site follow a Debye model with no offsets. No
evidence for Tb/Ti site interchange was observed within an upper limit of 2%.
Likewise, no excess or deficiency in the oxygen stoichiometry was observed,
within an upper limit of 2% of the nominal pyrochlore value. Tb L3- and Ti
K-edge XAFS measurements from 20-300 K similarly indicate a well-ordered local
structure. Other aspects of the structure are considered. We conclude that

interconnections are given by random and scale-free complex network models.
Regular networks, which are common in parallel computing architectures, are
also used as a standard for comparison. The processing load is assigned to the
processing nodes on demand, and the efficiency of the overall computing is
quantified in terms of the respective speed-ups. It is found that random
networks allow higher computing efficiency than their scale-free counterparts
as a consequence of the smaller number of isolated clusters implied by the
former model. At the same time, for fixed cluster sizes, the scale free model
tend to provide slightly better efficiency. Two modifications of the random and
scale free paradigms, where new connections tend to favor more recently added
nodes, are proposed and shown to be more effective for grid computing than the
standard models. A well-defined correlation is observed between the topological
properties of the network and their respective computing efficiency.

control of various macroscopic effects such as rapid population inversions,

found that the structure of the Al matrix is affected by the presence of the

by means of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). The deterministic and stochastic
components of the process of switching between various conducting states of the
channel are expressed by two coefficients, $D^{(1)}$ and $D^{(2)}$, a drift and
a diffusion coefficient, respectively. The FPE leads to a Langevin equation.
This analysis reveals beside the well known deterministic aspects a turbulent,
cascade type of action. The (noisy-like) switching between different conducting
states prevents the channel from staying in one, closed or open state. The
similarity between the hydrodynamic flow in the turbulent regime and
hierarchical switching between conducting states of this biochannel is
discussed. A non-trivial character of $D^{(1)}$ and $D^{(2)}$ coefficients is
shown, which points to different processes governing the channel's action,
asymetrically depending on the history of the previously conducting states.
Moreover, the Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations provide information on
whether and how the statistics of the channel action change over various time
scales.

most parameter space of mSUGRA, the neutralino or the stau is LSP. Examining
both cases, we find that there is a simple correlation between the neutrino
mixing angles and the LSP branching ratios in the small $\tan\beta$ region so
that the model can be clearly tested in the future colliders. In the large

geometric deformations of their target space when the world-sheet length
changes scale from the ultra-violet to the infra-red. These equations, which
are also known in the mathematics literature as Ricci flows, are analyzed for
the particular case of two-dimensional target spaces, where they are found to
admit a systematic description as Toda system. Their zero curvature formulation
is made possible with the aid of a novel infinite dimensional Lie algebra,
which has anti-symmetric Cartan kernel and exhibits exponential growth. The
general solution is obtained in closed form using Backlund transformations, and
special examples include the sausage model and the decay process of conical
singularities to the plane. Thus, Ricci flows provide a non-linear
generalization of the heat equation in two dimensions with the same dissipative
properties. Various applications to dynamical problems of string theory are
also briefly discussed. Finally, we outline generalizations to higher
dimensional target spaces that exhibit sufficient number of Killing symmetries.

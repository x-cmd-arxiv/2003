considered as the low-frequency normal modes in a disc of orbits precessing at
different angular speeds. Such a concept is an adequate alternative to the
commonly used approach of treating the disc as a set of individual stars
rotating at near-circular orbits around the centre. The problem of determining
the normal modes is reduced to a simple integral equation in the form of the
classical eigen-value problem, where the eigen-value is directly equal to the
pattern speed of the mode, $\Omega_p$. An examination of the general properties
of the basic integral equation shows that two types of solutions exist,
bar-like and spiral. The numerical solutions of both types are obtained. The
characteristic pattern speeds are of the order of the mean orbit precession
speed, although for the bar-modes $\Omega_p$ can markedly exceed the maximum
precessing speed of orbits. It is shown that the bar-mode grows due to the
immediate action of its gravitational field on the stars at the resonance
regions. As for the spiral mode, its excitation is probably due to the inner
Lindblad resonance that can promote mode growth.

the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis) and the amount of mirror baryonic matter. Then we
perform a complete quantitative calculation of the implications of mirror dark

background (CMB) and the large scale structure (LSS) for a Universe in which a
significant part of dark matter is made of mirror baryons. Being the
microphysics of the mirror baryons identical to the one of the usual baryons,
we need only two extra thermodynamical parameters to describe our model: the
temperature of the mirror plasma (limited by the BBN) and the amount of mirror
baryonic matter. We extend the Jeans theory in order to study the structure
formation mechanism in linear regime. Using a numerical code, we compute the
temporal evolution of perturbations, the CMB anisotropies and the LSS power
spectra. We show as the decoupling time and the dissipative Silk scale of the
mirror baryons (both being different than for the ordinary ones) are key
features for the evolution of a Mirror Universe, and induces specific
signatures on the power spectra. We analyse the dependence of both CMB and LSS
spectra on the mirror sector temperature and on the amount of mirror baryons.
Confronting with the present observational data, we show that for x < 0.3 the
dark matter could be constituted entirely by mirror baryons, since in this case
mirror baryons at linear scales behave essentially like cold dark matter (CDM)
and substantial deviations are expected only at smaller scales which have
undergone non-linear growth from relatively large redshifts. In the case of x >
0.3 the pattern of the LSS power spectrum excludes the possibility of dark
matter consisting entirely of mirror baryons, but they could present as
admixture to the conventional CDM.

on scales comparable to an electron Compton wavelength, at which point the wave
energy will be dissipated through electron-positron pair production. We show
that this process operates if the magnetic field of the neutron star is
sufficiently strong and the ratio of the wavelength of the fast mode to its

efficiently converted into an extended pair-plasma fireball. The radiative

codes approach this problem by introducing non-gaseous, accreting sink
particles, and Eulerian codes may introduce fixed sink cells. However, until
now there has been no approach that allows Eulerian codes to follow accretion
onto multiple, moving objects. We have removed that limitation by extending the
sink particle capability to Eulerian hydrodynamics codes. We have tested this
new method and found that it produces excellent agreement with analytic
solutions. In analyzing our sink particle method, we present a method for
evaluating the disk viscosity parameter $\alpha$ due to the numerical viscosity
of a hydrodynamics code, and use it to compute $\alpha$ for our Cartesian AMR
code. We also present a simple application of this new method: studying the
transition from Bondi to Bondi-Hoyle accretion that occurs when a shock hits a

different from that due to molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). While the latter can
be understood using rate equation theories (RET), the islanding exponent
(connecting the power law growth of island density with growth rate) obtained
for the CVD growth is a puzzle, with the CVD exponent being almost twice the
MBE exponent. We carry out (2+1) dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo(MC)
simulations to study this CVD growth. Hydrogen plays a critical role during
growth. Disilane breaks up into hydrides on the Si surface. We use MC
simulations to explore a number of cases involving one or two migrating species
and show that the large islanding exponent is probably due to the presence of
two hydrides, one of which has a much shorter lifetime than the other. We
modify RET taking this possibility into account in order to shed light on the
experimental observation. We calculate the scaling properties of the island
distributions using MC simulations and the modified RET, and conclude that the
large effective CVD exponents arise from the failure of the simple island
number scaling scenario which no longer applies to the two-component situation

lattice antiferromagnet between the Neel state (which breaks spin rotation
invariance) and the paramagnetic valence bond solid (which preserves spin
rotation invariance but breaks lattice symmetries). We show that these two
states are separated by a second order quantum phase transition. The critical
theory is not expressed in terms of the order parameters characterizing either
state (as would be the case in Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory) but involves
fractionalized degrees of freedom and an emergent, topological, global
conservation law. A closely related theory describes the superfluid-insulator
transition of bosons at half-filling on a square lattice, in which the
insulator has a bond density wave order. Similar considerations are shown to
apply to transitions of antiferromagnets between the valence bond solid and the
Z_2 spin liquid: the critical theory has deconfined excitations interacting

increasing dc drive is applied in the longitudinal direction, the longitudinal
velocity increases in a series of discrete steps that are integer multiples of

also occur. These integer and fractional steps correspond to distinct stable

Magnetic dipolar interactions and spin flipping rules are essential ingredients
of the model. The results obtained follow from Monte Carlo simulations and from
the stochastic model we propose for dipole field diffusion. Correlations
established before quenching are shown to later drive the magnetization
process. We also show that in simple cubic lattices, m \propto sqrt(t) at time
t after H is applied, as observed in Fe_8, but only for 1+2\log_10(h_d/h_w)
time decades, where h_d is some near-neighbor magnetic dipolar field and a spin
reversal can occur only if the magnetic field acting on it is within some field
window (-h_w,h_w). However, the sqrt(t) behavior is not universal. For BCC and
FCC lattices, m \propto t^p, but p \simeq 0.7 . An expression for p in terms of
lattice parameters is derived. At later times the magnetization levels off to a
constant value. All these processes take place at approximately constant
magnetic energy if the annealing energy epsilon_a is larger than the tunneling
window's energy width (i.e., if epsilon_a \gtrsim g\mu_B h_w S). Thermal
processes come in only later on to drive further magnetization growth.

logic programming to evaluate queries to abductive frameworks with integrity
constraints when these frameworks contain both default and explicit negation.
The result is the ability to compute abduction over well-founded semantics with
explicit negation and answer sets. Our approach consists of a transformation
and an evaluation method. The transformation adjoins to each objective literal
$O$ in a program, an objective literal $not(O)$ along with rules that ensure
that $not(O)$ will be true if and only if $O$ is false. We call the resulting
program a {\em dual} program. The evaluation method, \wfsmeth, then operates on
the dual program. \wfsmeth{} is sound and complete for evaluating queries to
abductive frameworks whose entailment method is based on either the
well-founded semantics with explicit negation, or on answer sets. Further,
\wfsmeth{} is asymptotically as efficient as any known method for either class
of problems. In addition, when abduction is not desired, \wfsmeth{} operating
on a dual program provides a novel tabling method for evaluating queries to
ground extended programs whose complexity and termination properties are
similar to those of the best tabling methods for the well-founded semantics. A
publicly available meta-interpreter has been developed for \wfsmeth{} using the

simple Lie Algebras has been achieved in the past decade by Jakobsen (JA81,
JA83) and by Enright, Howe and Wallach (EH83) following different paths but
arriving at the same final results. In order to discuss unitarity we need to
introduce a scalar product. This is done in sections II and III introducing a
sesquilinear form on the universal enveloping algebra (GL90). Such a
sesquilinear form was introduced by Harish-Chandra (HC55), Gel'fand and
Kirillov (GK69) and Shapovalov (SH72). The new developments given to Jakobsen
method in GEL90 are contained in sections IV and V. In section VI we summarize
the principal results due to Enright Howe and Wallach (EHW method). In section
VII we give the possible places for unitarity including those for which the
reduction level can't be higher than one and that were not considered in GEL90.
We see also in this section and in a explicit way how the Jakobsen method and
the EHW method give the same final results. This type of representations have
found applications in physics for a long time (see GK75, 82; GL83, 89; LO86, 89

conformal and de Sitter algebras. In particular the construction of wave
equations for conformal multispinors and the wave equations in de Sitter space

of the classical algebras in the subspace Omega extending the results obtained

faithfully irreducible representation of ${\cal A}_0$ in the sense that every
faithful representation of ${\cal A}_0$ has a subrepresentation that is
equivalent to $\rho_0$. We therefore identify a classical fermion with $\rho_0$

  Rates","16 pages. Version 2 corrects errors in the stabilizer code review",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The tolerable erasure error rate for scalable quantum computation is shown to
be at least 0.292, given standard scalability assumptions. This bound is
obtained by implementing computations with generic stabilizer code
teleportation steps that combine the necessary operations with error
correction. An interesting consequence of the technique is that the only errors
that affect the maximum tolerable error rate are storage and Bell measurement
errors. If storage errors are negligible, then any detected Bell measurement
error below 1/2 is permissible. Another consequence of the technique is that
the maximum tolerable depolarizing error rate is dominated by how well one can
prepare the required encoded states. For example, if storage and Bell
measurement errors are relatively small, then independent depolarizing errors
with error rate close to 0.1 per qubit are tolerable in the prepared states.
The implementation overhead is dominated by the efficiency with which the
required encoded states can be prepared. At present, this efficiency is very
low, particularly for error rates close to the maximum tolerable ones.

non--parametric Bayesian approach to determine quantum potentials from

explicitly the classical and semiclassical limits and provides a unified
description in terms of functional integrals: the Feynman path integral for the
statistical operator, and the integration over the space of potentials for
calculating the predictive density. The latter is treated in maximum a
posteriori approximation, and various approximation schemes for the former are
developed and discussed. A simple numerical example shows the applicability of
the method.

computing, we discuss ultrafast laser pulse shaping, in particular, the
acousto-optic modulator based Fourier-Transform pulse-shaper, which has the
ability to modulate tunable high power ultrafast laser pulses. We show that
optical pulse shaping is an attractive route to quantum computing since shaped
pulses can be transmitted over optical hardware and the same infrastructure can
be used for computation and optical information transfer. We also address the

N-qubit Hilbert space. When considered as the vertices of a geometrical figure,
the resulting states form the equivalent of a Platonic solid. The
discretization technique inherently describes a class of pi/2 rotations that
connect neighboring states in the set, i.e. that leave the geometrical figures
invariant. These rotations are shown to generate the Clifford group, a general
group of discrete transformations on N qubits. Discretizing the N-qubit Hilbert
space allows us to define its digital quantum information content, and we show
that this information content grows as N^2. While we believe the discrete sets
are interesting because they allow extra-classical behavior--such as quantum
entanglement and quantum parallelism--to be explored while circumventing the
continuity of Hilbert space, we also show how they may be a useful tool for
problems in traditional quantum computation. We describe in detail the discrete
sets for one and two qubits.

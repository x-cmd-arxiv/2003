metallicity during their final thermal pulse asymptotic giant branch phase is
studied in detail. As representative examples models with initial masses of
4Msun and 5Msun with a metallicity of Z=0.0001 ([Fe/H] ~ -2.3) are discussed.
The 1D stellar structure and evolution model includes time- and depth dependent
overshooting motivated by hydrodynamical simulations, as well as a full nuclear
network and time-dependent mixing. Particular attention is given to high time
and space resolution to avoid numerical artefacts related to third dredge-up
and hot-bottom burning predictions. The model calculations predict very
efficient third dredge-up which mixes the envelope with the entire intershell
layer or a large fraction thereof, and in some cases penetrates into the C/O
core below the He-shell. In all cases primary oxygen is mixed into the
envelope. The models predict efficient envelope burning during the interpulse
phase. Depending on the envelope burning temperature, oxygen is destroyed to
varying degrees. The combined effect of dredge-up and envelope burning does not
lead to any significant oxygen depletion in any of the cases considered in this
study. The large dredge-up efficiency in our model is closely related to the
particular properties of the H-shell during the dredge-up phase in
low-metallicity very metal poor stars, which is followed here over many thermal
pulses. During the dredge-up phase, the temperature just below the convective
boundary is large enough for protons to burn vigorously when they are brought
into the C-rich environment below the convection boundary by the time- and
depth dependent overshooting. H-burning luminosities of 10^5 to ~2* 10^6L_sun
are generated. [...]

geological record over the last 542 Myr, on timescales close, in the order of
magnitude, to 1 Myr. What is the origin of this quasi-periodicity? What is the
nature of the global events that define the boundaries of the geological time
scale? I propose that a single mechanism is responsible for all three types of
such events: mass extinctions, geomagnetic polarity reversals, and sea-level
fluctuations. The mechanism is fast, and involves a significant energy release.
The mechanism is unlikely to have astronomical causes, both because of the
energies involved, and because it acts quasi-periodically. It must then be
sought within the Earth itself. And it must be capable of reversing the Earth's
magnetic field. The last requirement makes it incompatible with the consensus
model of the origin of the geomagnetic field - the hydromagnetic dynamo
operating in the Earth's fluid core. In the second part of the paper, I show
that a vast amount of seemingly unconnected geophysical and geological data can
be understood in a unified way if the source of the Earth's main magnetic field
is a ~200-km-thick lithosphere, repeatedly magnetized as a result of
methane-driven oceanic eruptions, which produce ocean flow capable of dynamo
action. The eruptions are driven by the interplay of buoyancy forces and
exsolution of dissolved gas, which accumulates in the oceanic water masses
prone to stagnation and anoxia. Polarity reversals, mass extinctions, and
sequence boundaries are consequences of these eruptions. Unlike the consensus
model of geomagnetism, this scenario is consistent with the paleomagnetic data
showing that ""directional changes during a [geomagnetic polarity] reversal can
be astonishingly fast, possibly occurring as a nearly instantaneous jump from
one inclined dipolar state to another in the opposite hemisphere"".

predominates up to now and very many people devote oneself to it. It is
explained in the present paper why the only first order phase transition
observed on the way from the Abrikosov state in the normal state should be
interpreted as phase coherence disappearance. The false concept of vortex
lattice melting appeared because of some causes main of them are erroneous
interpretation of direct observation of the Abrikosov state and the use by
theorists the habitual determination of phase coherence invalid for
multi-connected superconducting state. The distinguished work by A.A. Abrikosov
awarded of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 2003 predicted a periodic lattice
structure with crystalline long-rang order only because that it is impossible
to obtain any other result for the case of homogeneous, symmetric, infinite
space. It is strange that most scientists have lightly admitted that this
prediction corresponds to the facts. The long-rang order of superconducting
state is phase coherence. Therefore if the Abrikosov state is also the vortex
lattice then it have two long-rang orders and two phase transition may be
expected. But only phase transition is assumed and observed always. History of
this contradiction is considered in the present paper and it is analysed why
some delusions about the Abrikosov state became popular. It is emphasized that
taking into account thermal fluctuations changes in essence the habitual notion
about the mixed state of type II superconductor built because of the Abrikosov
result. First of all it shows that the Abrikosov solution is not valid just in
the ideal case for which it was obtained.

rate of expansion of the universe is due to vacuum quantum effects arising in
curved spacetime. The theoretical basis of the vacuum cold dark matter (VCDM),
or vacuum metamorphosis, cosmological model of Parker and Raval is revisited
and improved. We show, by means of a manifestly nonperturbative approach, how
the infrared behavior of the propagator (related to the large-time asymptotic
form of the heat kernel) of a free scalar field in curved spacetime causes the
vacuum expectation value of its energy-momentum tensor to exhibit a resonance
effect when the scalar curvature R of the spacetime reaches a particular value
related to the mass of the field. we show that the back reaction caused by this
resonance drives the universe through a transition to an accelerating expansion
phase, very much in the same way as originally proposed by Parker and Raval.
Our analysis includes higher derivatives that were neglected in the earlier
analysis, and takes into account the possible runaway solutions that can follow
from these higher-derivative terms. We find that the runaway solutions do not
occur if the universe was described by the usual classical FRW solution prior
to the growth of vacuum energy-density and negative pressure (i.e., vacuum
metamorphosis) that causes the transition to an accelerating expansion of the
universe in this theory.

the bulk geometry and dynamics of a cosmological brane in terms of the local

mass in the bulk. We show that there is a unique generalization of the dark
radiation on the brane, which is given by the local mass. We find there also
exists a conserved current associated with the Weyl tensor, and the
corresponding local charge, which we call the Weyl charge, is given by the sum
of the local mass and a certain linear combination of the components of the
bulk energy-momentum tensor. This expression of the Weyl charge relates the
local mass with the projected Weyl tensor, $E_{\mu\nu}$, which plays a central
role in the geometrical formalism of the RS braneworld. On the brane, in
particular, this gives a decomposition of the projected Weyl tensor into the
local mass and the bulk energy-momentum tensor. Then, as an application of
these results, we consider a null dust model for the bulk energy-momentum
tensor and discuss the black hole formation in the bulk. We investigate the
causal structure by identifying the locus of the apparent horizon and clarify
possible brane trajectories in the bulk. We find that the brane stays always
outside the black hole as long as it is expanding. We also find an upper bound
on the value of the Hubble parameter in terms of the matter energy density on

the brane-induced gravity, that effectively introduces a soft graviton mass. We
study the issues of unitarity, analyticity and causality in this model in more
than five dimensions. We show that a consistent prescription for the poles of
the Green's function can be specified so that 4D unitarity is preserved.
However, in certain instances 4D analyticity cannot be maintained when theory
becomes higher dimensional. As a result, one has to sacrifice 4D causality at
distances of the order of the present-day Hubble scale. This is a welcome
feature for solving the cosmological constant problem, as was recently argued
in the literature. We also show that, unlike the 4D massive gravity, the model
has no strong-coupling problem at intermediate scales.

Elliott et al., and a simple algorithm for computing SO(5) > SO(3) spherical
harmonics. The latter has much in common with the methods of Chacon, Moshinsky,
and Sharp but is conceptually and computationally simpler. Results are
presented for collective models ranging from the sherical vibrator to the
Wilets-Jean and axially symmetric rotor-vibrator models.

account up to the one-nucleon loop and one-meson loop. The tensor couplings for
the $\omega$- and $\rho$-meson are included in the model. After adjusting the
parameters of the model to the properties of spherical nuclei, a large
effective nucleon mass $m^{*}/M_{N} \approx 0.78$ is obtained. The overall
nucleon spectra of shell-model states are in agreement with the data. The
computed anti-nucleon spectra in the vacuum differ about 20 -- 30 MeV with and

filamentation instability in collisional regimes, deriving a generalized
dispersion relation from self-consistent beam-Maxwell equations. For
symmetrically counterstreaming, fully relativistic electron currents, the
collisional coupling between electrons and ions creates the unstable modes of
growing oscillation and wave, which stand out for long-wavelength
perturbations. In the stronger collisional regime, the growing oscillatory mode
tends to be dominant for all wavelengths. In the collisionless limit, those
modes vanish, while maintaining another purely growing mode that exactly
coincides with a standard relativistic Weibel mode. It is also shown that the
effects of electron-electron collisions and thermal spread lower the growth
rate of the relativistic Weibel instability. The present mechanisms of
filamentation dynamics are essential for transport of homogeneous electron beam
produced by the interaction of high power laser pulses with plasma.

been demonstrated in numerous realizations of Young's classical double-slit
interference experiment and its analogues. However, quantum entanglement - a
significant coherent superposition in multiparticle systems - yields phenomena
that are much richer and more interesting than anything that can be seen in a
one-particle system. Among them, one important type of multi-particle
experiments uses path-entangled number-states, which exhibit pure higher-order
interference and allow novel applications in metrology and imaging such as
quantum interferometry and spectroscopy with phase sensitivity at the
Heisenberg limit or quantum lithography beyond the classical diffraction limit.
Up to now, in optical implementations of such schemes lower-order interference
effects would always decrease the overall performance at higher particle
numbers. They have thus been limited to two photons. We overcome this
limitation and demonstrate a linear-optics-based four-photon interferometer.
Observation of a four-particle mode-entangled state is confirmed by
interference fringes with a periodicity of one quarter of the single-photon
wavelength. This scheme can readily be extended to arbitrary photon numbers and
thus represents an important step towards realizable applications with
entanglement-enhanced performance.

``non-locality'' of QM. We show that QM satisfies the correct locality bound
for non-commuting variables -- and is therefore local for 2 or more particles.
We further show that the entangled wavefunctions that produce non-local
de-Broglie-Bohm guidance equations are an artifact of First Quantization, and
that the wavefunctions describing such experiments do factorize in Second
Quantization (QED).

turbulent simulations in order to investigate the role of magnetic fields in
self-gravitating core formation within turbulent molecular clouds. Statistical
properties of our super-Alfvenic model without gravity agree with previous
similar studies. Including self-gravity, our models give the following results.
They are consistent with the turbulent fragmentation prediction of the core
mass distribution of Padoan & Nordlund. They also confirm that local
gravitational collapse is not prevented by magnetohydrodynamic waves driven by
turbulent flows, even when the turbulent Jeans mass exceeds the mass in the
simulation volume. Comparison of results between 256^3 and 512^3 zone
simulations reveals convergence in the collapse rate. Analysis of
self-gravitating cores formed in the simulation shows that: (1) All cores
formed are magnetically supercritical by at least an order of magnitude. (2) A
power law relation between central magnetic field strength and density B_c
propto rho_c^{1/2} is observed despite the cores being strongly supercritical.
(3) Specific angular momentum j propto R^{3/2} for cores with radius R. (4)
Most cores are prolate and triaxial in shape, in agreement with the results of

  The Reason for the Prolate Geometry of SN1987A?","15 pages, including 7 figures, to appear in PASJ",,"10.1093/pasj/56.4.663",,"astro-ph",,"  We have carried out 2-D simulations of core-collapse supernova explosions.
The local neutrino radiation field is assumed to have its maximum value either
at the symmetry (polar) axis or on the equatorial plane. These lead to the
prolate and oblate explosions, respectively. We find that the gain of the
explosion energy in the prolate explosion evolves more predominately than that
in the oblate one when the total neutrino luminosity is given. Namely, the
prolate explosion is more energetic than the oblate one.
  One of the authors (Shimizu et al. 2001) showed for the first time that
globally anisotropic neutrino radiation produces more powerful explosion than
the spherical neutrino radiation does. In our previous study (Madokoro et al.
2003), we improved the numerical code of Shimizu et al. and demonstrated that
the globally anisotropic neutrino radiation yields more energetic explosion
than spatially-fluctuated neutrino radiation does. Together with the result of
this paper, we conclude that the globally anisotropic (prolate) neutrino
radiation is the most effective way of increasing the explosion energy among
various types of explosions investigated in these studies. We discuss the
reason for this. Our result is suggestive of the fact that the expanding
materials of SN1987A is observed to have a prolate geometry.

polyhierarchy by a generating polyhierarchy of classification criteria.
Similarly to existing approaches, the classification categories are defined by
logical functions encoded by attributive expressions. However, the generating
hierarchy explicitly predefines domains of criteria applicability, and the
semantics of relations between categories is invariant to changes in the
universe composition, extending variety of criteria, and increasing their
cardinalities. The generating polyhierarchy is an independent, compact,
portable, and re-usable information structure serving as a template
classification. It can be associated with one or more particular sets of
objects, included in more general classifications as a standard component, or
used as a prototype for more comprehensive classifications. The approach
dramatically simplifies development and unplanned modifications of persistent
hierarchical classifications compared with tree, DAG, and faceted schemes. It
can be efficiently implemented in common DBMS, while considerably reducing
amount of computer resources required for storage, maintenance, and use of
complex polyhierarchies.

in neutron stars is reexamined by taking into account the charge screening
effect. The Maxwell construction is shown to be not conflicted with the Gibbs
conditions once the Coulomb potential is properly taken into account. Taking
the hadron-quark deconfinement transition as an example, we explicitly
demonstrate a mechanical instability of the geometrical structure of the
structured mixed phase by the charge screening effect. In this case we have
effectively the picture given by the Maxwell construction.

condensations are briefly introduced. Finally, relevance of meson condensations
in hadronic matter to those in color superconductivity are briefly mentioned.

  and Anomalous Cross Section induced by Quantum Interference","6 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.69.052711",,"quant-ph",,"  Partial wave theory of a three dmensional scattering problem for an arbitray
short range potential and a nonlocal Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux is
established. The scattering process of a ``hard shere'' like potential and the
magnetic flux is examined. An anomalous total cross section is revealed at the
specific quantized magnetic flux at low energy which helps explain the
composite fermion and boson model in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Since
the nonlocal quantum interference of magnetic flux on the charged particles is
universal, the nonlocal effect is expected to appear in quite general potential
system and will be useful in understanding some other phenomena in mesoscopic
phyiscs.

the normal ordering of exponentiated boson ([a,a*]=1) monomials of the form

generating functions (egf). They turn out to be of Sheffer-type. We demonstrate
that two key properties of these sequences remain preserved under
substitutional composition: (a)the property of being the solution of the
Stieltjes moment problem; and (b) the representation of these sequences through
infinite series (Dobinski-type relations). We present a number of examples of
such composition satisfying properties (a) and (b). We obtain new Dobinski-type
formulas and solve the associated moment problem for several hierarchically
defined combinatorial families of sequences.

radiation mode, is done using the Holstein-Primakoff transformation. The main
aim of the paper is to show that, changing the quantization axis with respect
to the common usage, it is possible to prove a general result either for N or
the coupling constant going to infinity for the exact solution of the model.
This completes the analysis, known in the current literature, with respect to
the same model in the limit of N and volume going to infinity, keeping the
density constant. For the latter the proper axis of quantization is given by
the Hamiltonian of the two-level atoms and for the former the proper axis of
quantization is defined by the interaction. The relevance of this result relies
on the observation that a general measurement apparatus acts using
electromagnetic interaction and so, one can states that the thermodynamic limit
is enough to grant the appearance of classical effects. Indeed, recent
experimental results give first evidence that superposition states disappear
interacting with an electromagnetic field having a large number of photons.

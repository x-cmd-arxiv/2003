Expectation functionals are defined through the L \to \infty limit of a chain
of length L; the functional measure is found to have its weight mostly on
configurations boosted by an amount increasing at least powerlike with L. This
entails that despite the non-amenability a certain subclass of noninvariant
functions is averaged to an SO(1,2) invariant result. Outside this class
symmetry breaking is generic. Performing an Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction
based on the infinite volume averages one finds that the reconstructed quantum
theory is different from the original one. The reconstructed Hilbert space is

boundary potential, that are the number and degeneracies of the stationary
points. The boundary renormalization group flows are obtained by varying the
boundary potential while keeping the bulk critical: they satisfy new selection
rules and correspond to real deformations of the Arnold simple singularities of
A_k type. The description of conformal boundary conditions in terms of boundary
potential and associated ground state solitons is extended to the N=2
supersymmetric case, finding agreement with the analysis of A-type boundaries
by Hori, Iqbal and Vafa.

  Diggavi","Nonintersecting Subspaces Based on Finite Alphabets","14 pages","IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory 51 (2005), 4320-4325",,,"math.CO",,"  Two subspaces of a vector space are here called ``nonintersecting'' if they
meet only in the zero vector. The following problem arises in the design of
noncoherent multiple-antenna communications systems. How many pairwise
nonintersecting M_t-dimensional subspaces of an m-dimensional vector space V
over a field F can be found, if the generator matrices for the subspaces may
contain only symbols from a given finite alphabet A subseteq F? The most
important case is when F is the field of complex numbers C; then M_t is the
number of antennas. If A = F = GF(q) it is shown that the number of
nonintersecting subspaces is at most (q^m-1)/(q^{M_t}-1), and that this bound
can be attained if and only if m is divisible by M_t. Furthermore these
subspaces remain nonintersecting when ``lifted'' to the complex field. Thus the
finite field case is essentially completely solved. In the case when F = C only
the case M_t=2 is considered. It is shown that if A is a PSK-configuration,
consisting of the 2^r complex roots of unity, the number of nonintersecting
planes is at least 2^{r(m-2)} and at most 2^{r(m-1)-1} (the lower bound may in
fact be the best that can be achieved).

monitoring (TCM) applications in mechanical lathe machining are analyzed in
this paper. Time series data and root mean square (RMS) values at various tool
wear levels are shown to exhibit features that can be put into relation with
ageing in both cases. In particular, the histograms of raw data show power-law
distributions above a cross-over value, in which newer cutting tools exhibit
more numerous larger events compared with more worn-out ones. For practical
purposes, statistics based on RMS values are more feasible, and the analysis of
these also reveals discriminating age-related features. The assumption that
experimental RMS histograms follow a Beta (b) distribution has also been
tested. The residuals of the modeling b functions indicate that the search for
a more appropriate fitting function for the experimental distribution is
desirable.

  (eds.) http://www.ociw.edu/symposia/symposium4/proceedings.html",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present detailed abundance results for 9 Galactic bulge stars in Baade's
Window, based on HIRES (R=45,000--60,000) spectra taken with the Keck I
telescope.
  The alpha elements show non-uniform enhancements relative to the Solar
neighborhood trends: Mg and Si are enhanced in all our bulge stars by
$\sim$0.5--0.3 dex, showing a slight decrease with increasing [Fe/H]. Oxygen is
enhanced in most bulge stars, similar to the Galactic halo, but the [O/Fe]
ratios suddenly decline beginning at [Fe/H]=$-$0.5 dex, with a slope consistent
with no oxygen production in the bulge for [Fe/H]$\geq$$-$0.5 dex. The observed
production of magnesium in the absence of oxygen synthesis appears to be
inconsistent with current predictions for supernova nucleosynthesis yields; we
suggest that this may be connected to the Wolf-Rayet phenomenon, which occurs
in the pertinent metallicity range. The trend of [Ti/Fe] shows an enhancement
relative to the solar neighborhood of $\sim$0.3 dex, but declines somewhat by
solar metallicity; thus, the Ti trend is less extreme than found by McWilliam &
Rich (1994, MR94). For metal-poor bulge stars calcium is enhanced by $\sim$0.3
dex, similar to the Galactic halo, but in our bulge stars with
[Fe/H]$\geq$$-$0.5, Ca show a slight deficiency relative to the solar
neighborhood value, consistent with the findings of MR94; this may indicate a
slightly top-heavy IMF as suggested by MR94 and McWilliam (1997). Aluminum is
enhanced in all our Galactic bulge giant stars by $\sim$0.25 dex; we argue that
this is consistent with nucleosynthesis dominated by type II supernova events
(SNII), implied by the Mg and Si enhancements. (Abridged)

\eta = 6.14 to within a few percent, big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN)
calculations can make relatively accurate predictions of the abundances of the
light element isotopes which can be tested against observational abundance
determinations. At this value of \eta, the Li7 abundance is predicted to be
significantly higher than that observed in low metallicity halo dwarf stars.
Among the possible resolutions to this discrepancy are 1) Li7 depletion in the
atmosphere of stars; 2) systematic errors originating from the choice of
stellar parameters - most notably the surface temperature; and 3) systematic
errors in the nuclear cross sections used in the nucleosynthesis calculations.
Here, we explore the last possibility, and focus on possible systematic errors
in the He3(\alpha,\gamma)Be7 reaction, which is the only important Li7
production channel in BBN. The absolute value of the cross section for this key
reaction is known relatively poorly both experimentally and theoretically. The
agreement between the standard solar model and solar neutrino data thus
provides additional constraints on variations in the cross section (S_{34}).
Using the standard solar model of Bahcall, and recent solar neutrino data, we
can exclude systematic S_{34} variations of the magnitude needed to resolve the
BBN Li7 problem at > 95% CL. Additional laboratory data on
He3(\alpha,\gamma)Be7 will sharpen our understanding of both BBN and solar
neutrinos, particularly if care is taken in determining the absolute cross
section and its uncertainties. Nevertheless, it already seems that this
``nuclear fix'' to the Li7 BBN problem is unlikely; other possible solutions
are briefly discussed.

application of a dc field. The method is specially suitable for Rydberg atoms.
We present a simple argument for the control of emission.

emerge from an analysis of the Lagrangian density of the Klein-Gordon field:
normalization problems arise and interaction with external electromagnetic
fields cannot take place. By contrast, the Dirac equation is free of these
problems. Other inconsistencies arise if the Klein-Gordon field is regarded as
a classical field.

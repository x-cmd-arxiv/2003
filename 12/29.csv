presented. Monitoring of Q2237+0305 in July-October 2000, made at nearly daily
basis, did not reveal rapid (night-to-night and intranight) variations of
brightness of the components during this time period. Rather slow changes of
magnitudes of the components were observed, such as 0.08 mag fading of B and C
components and 0.05 mag brightening of D in R band during July 23 - October 7,
2000. By good luck three nights in 1999 were almost at the time of the strong
brightness peak of image C, and approximately in the middle of the ascending
slope of the image A brightness peak. The C component was the most blue one in
the system in 1998 and 1999, having changed its (V-I) color from 0.56 mag to
0.12 mag since August 1997, while its brightness increased almost 1.2 mag
during this time period. The A component behaved similarly between August 1998
and August 2000, having become 0.47 mag brighter in R, and at the same time,
0.15 mag bluer. A correlation between the color variations and variations of
magnitudes of the components is demonstrated to be significant and reaches
0.75, with a regression line slope of 0.33. A color (V-I) vrs color (V-R) plot
shows the components settled in a cluster, stretched along a line with a slope
of 1.31. Both slopes are noticeably smaller than those expected if a standard
galactic interstellar reddening law were responsible for the differences
between the colors of images and their variations over time. We attribute the
brightness and color changes to microlensing of the quasar's structure, which
we conclude is more compact at shorter wavelengths, as predicted by most quasar
models featuring an energizing central source.

that the density of bursts is roughly constant per logarithmic interval in
burst fluence S_E and observed spectral peak energy Ep_obs, and in
isotropic-equivalent energy Eiso and rest frame spectral peak energy Epeak. In
this paper, we explore a unified jet model of all three kinds of bursts, using
population synthesis simulations of the bursts and detailed modeling of the
instruments that detect them. We show that both a variable jet opening-angle
model in which the emissivity is a constant independent of the angle relative
to the jet axis and a universal jet model in which the emissivity is a
power-law function of the angle relative to the jet axis can explain the
observed properties of GRBs reasonably well. However, if one tries to account
for the properties of all three kinds of bursts in a unified picture, the extra
degree of freedom available in the variable jet opening-angle model enables it
to explain the observations reasonably well while the power-law universal jet
model cannot. The variable jet opening-angle model of XRFs, X-ray-rich GRBs,
and GRBs implies that the energy Egamma radiated in gamma rays is ~ 100 times
less than has been thought, and that most GRBs have very small jet opening
angles (~ half a degree). It also implies that there are ~ 10^4 - 10^5 more
bursts with very small jet opening angles for every burst that is observable.
If this is the case, the rate of GRBs could be comparable to the rate of Type
Ic core collapse supernovae.

transformation which hybridizes up and down spin electrons is introduced. By
using this method, the phase diagram of the two-dimensional Hubbard model with
next-nearest-neighbor transfer is accurately determined by treating the
filling-control (FC) and bandwidth-control (BC) Mott transitions on the same

chemical potential and the Coulomb interaction, where the transitions at the
corner (BC) and the edges (FC) show contrasted characters with large critical
fluctuations near the edges coexisting with the first-order transition at the
corner. This contrasted behavior is shown to be consistent with the V-shape
structure of the phase boundary because of a general relation, in which the
slope of the metal-insulator transition line in the phase diagram is expressed
by thermodynamic quantities. The V-shaped opening of the Mott gap is favorably
compared with the experimental results of the transition metal oxides.

range 1.9 - 2.4 GeV obtained in recent partial wave analysis of
proton-antiproton annihilation at LEAR remarkably confirm all predictions of
chiral symmetry restoration. Classification of excited $\bar q q$ mesons
according to the representations of chiral $U(2)_L \times U(2)_R$ group is
performed. There are two important predictions of chiral symmetry restoration
in highly excited mesons: (i) physical states must fill out approximately
degenerate parity-chiral multiplets; (ii) some of the physical states with the
given $I,J^{PC}$ are members of one parity-chiral multiplet, while the other
states with the same $I,J^{PC}$ are members of the other parity-chiral
multiplet. For example, while some of the excited $\rho(1,1^{--})$ states are
systematically degenerate with $a_1(1,1^{++})$ states forming (0,1)+(1,0)
chiral multiplets, the other excited $\rho(1,1^{--})$ states are degenerate
with $h_1(0,1^{+-})$ states ((1/2,1/2) chiral multiplets). Hence, one of the
predictions of chiral symmetry restoration is that the combined amount of
$a_1(1,1^{++})$ and $h_1(0,1^{+-})$ states must coincide with the amount of
$\rho(1,1^{--})$ states in the chirally restored regime. It is shown that the
same rule applies (and experimentally confirmed) to many other meson states.

The second analysis is carried out by setting an initial condition such that
each mode of inflaton starts as the vacuum fluctuation of the Hamiltonian when
being released from the constraint of cutoff. The first intuitive discussion is
then shown to be correct qualitatively.

conformal field theories by T-dualities or lead to a new kind of sigma model

analogous to the Dirac sea of the fermion vacuum, and that a hole produced by
the annihilation of one negative energy boson is an anti-particle. Here, we
must admit that it is only possible if we allow --as occurs in the usual
formalism anyway-- that the ""Hilbert space"" for the single particle bosons is
not positive definite. This might be formally coped with by introducing the
notion of a double harmonic oscillator, which is obtained by extending the
condition imposed on the wave function. This double harmonic oscillator
includes not only positive energy states but also negative energy states. We
utilize this method to construct a general formalism for a boson sea analogous
to the Dirac sea, irrespective of the existence of supersymmetry. The physical
result is consistent with that of the ordinary second quantization formalism.
We finally suggest applications of our method to the string theories.

"math/0312485","Plotkin Boris","B. Plotkin","Algebraic geometry in First Order Logic","83pp",,,,"math.GM math.LO",,"  In every variety of algebras $\Theta$ we can consider its logic and its
algebraic geometry. In the previous papers geometry in equational logic, i.e.,
equational geometry has been studied. Here we describe an extension of this
theory towards the First Order Logic (FOL). The algebraic sets in this geometry
are determined by arbitrary sets of FOL formulas. The principal motivation of
such generalization lies in the area of applications to knowledge science.
  In this paper the FOL formulae are considered in the context of algebraic
logic.
  With this aim we define special Halmos categories. These categories in the
algebraic geometry related to FOL play the same role as the category of free
algebras $\Theta^0$ play in the equational algebraic geometry.
  The paper consists of three parts. Section 1 is of introductory character.
The first part (sections 2--4) contains background on algebraic logic in the
given variety of algebras $\Theta$. The second part is devoted to algebraic
geometry related to FOL (sections 5--7). In the last part (sections 8--9) we
consider applications of the previous material to knowledge science.

a ring $R$ and an ideal $\a \subset R$, which we call the F-pure threshold
$\mathrm{c}(\a)$ of $\a$, and study its properties. We see that the F-pure
threshold characterizes several ring theoretic properties. By virtue of Hara
and Yoshida's result, the F-pure threshold $\mathrm{c}(\a)$ in characteristic
zero corresponds to the log canonical threshold $\mathrm{lc}(\a)$ which is an
important invariant in birational geometry. Using the F-pure threshold, we
prove some ring theoretic properties of three-dimensional terminal
singularities of characteristic zero. Also, in fixed prime characteristic, we
establish several properties of F-pure threshold similar to those of the log
canonical threshold with quite simple proofs.

a statistical model of the early stage, this is interpreted as a sign of the
phase transition to a QGP, which causes a sharp change in the energy dependence
of the strangeness to entropy ratio. This observation naturally motivates us to
study the production of multistrange hyperons ($\Xi$, $\Omega$) as a function
of the beam energy. Furthermore it was suggested that the kinematic freeze-out
of $\Omega$ takes place directly at QGP hadronization. If this is indeed the
case, the transverse momentum spectra of the $\Omega$ directly reflect the
transverse expansion velocity of a hadronizing QGP. In this report we show
preliminary NA49 results on $\Omega^{-}$ and $\bar{\Omega}^{+}$ production in
central Pb+Pb collisions at 40 and 158 A$\cdot$GeV and compare them to

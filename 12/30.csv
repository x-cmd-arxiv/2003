evolution of the massive progenitor star. In contrast to Cassiopeia A, there is
little evidence for X-ray-emitting ejecta from explosive nucleosynthesis, i.e.,
material enriched in Si, S, and particularly, Fe. This limits the amount of
mixing or overturning of deep ejecta material in G292.0+1.8 and suggests that
the ejecta are strongly stratified by composition and that the reverse shock
has not propagated to the Si/S or Fe-rich zones. On the other hand, the bright
equatorial belt is dominated by X-ray emission with normal chemical
composition, which supports shocked dense circumstellar material for its
origin. We find that the thermal pressure in the SNR is much higher than the

further limits the number. We compare the result with observations to find that
the observed number (< 25) of HI SNRs is much less than the expected. A
plausible explanation is that previous observational studies, which were made
toward the SNRs identified mostly in radio continuum, missed most of the HI
SNRs because they are too faint to be visible in radio continuum. We propose
that the faint, extended HI 21-cm emission line wings protruding from the
Galactic background HI emission in large-scale (l, v) diagrams could be
possible candidates for HI SNRs, although our preliminary result shows that
their number is considerably less than the expected in the inner Galaxy. We
conclude that a possible explanation for the small number of \schi SNRs in the
inner Galaxy is that the interstellar space there is largely filled with a very
tenuous gas as in the three-phase ISM model.

we insert edges between the vertices according to the rank of their correlation
strength, resulting in a network called asset graph. We study its properties,
such as topologically different growth types, number and size of clusters and
clustering coefficient. These properties, calculated from empirical data, are
compared against those of a random graph. The growth of the graph can be
classified according to the topological role of the newly inserted edge. We
find that the type of growth which is responsible for creating cycles in the
graph sets in much earlier for the empirical asset graph than for the random
graph, and thus reflects the high degree of networking present in the market.
We also find the number of clusters in the random graph to be one order of
magnitude higher than for the asset graph. At a critical threshold, the random
graph undergoes a radical change in topology related to percolation transition
and forms a single giant cluster, a phenomenon which is not observed for the
asset graph. Differences in mean clustering coefficient lead us to conclude
that most information is contained roughly within 10% of the edges.

clustering in time and space. Our main finding is that synthetic catalogs
generated by the OFC model share practically all properties of real seismicity
at a qualitative level, with however significant quantitative differences. We
find that OFC catalogs can be in large part described by the concept of
triggered seismicity but the properties of foreshocks depend on the mainshock
magnitude, in qualitative agreement with the critical earthquake model and in
disagreement with simple models of triggered seismicity such as the Epidemic
Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model [Ogata, 1988]. Many other features of OFC
catalogs can be reproduced with the ETAS model with a weaker clustering than
real seismicity, i.e. for a very small average number of triggered earthquakes
of first generation per mother-earthquake.

generalization of Brans-Dicke theory, we propose a new gravity theory with a
complex scalar field $\phi$ which is coupled to the cosmological curvature
scalar. Through such a coupling, the Higgs mechanism is naturally incorporated
into the evolution of the universe, and a running density of the field vacuum
energy is obtained which may release the particle standard model from the
rigorous cosmological constant problem in some sense. Our model predicts a
running mass scale of the fundamental particles in which the gauge symmetry
breaks spontaneously. The running speed of the mass scale in our case could
survive all existing experiments.

heavy-ion reactions at RHIC energies -- surprising because in spite of their
QCD bells and whistles, they essentially embody classical many-particle

interactions, however -- an essential aspect of all such models -- is by
necessity a phenomenological (and somewhat arbitrary) feature of these codes.
This has been recognized early on as a serious drawback of non-covariant
cascade models.
  While in the Poincare-Covariant Parton Cascade code ""pcpc"" the interaction
sequence is determined covariantly and thus is independent of the frame of
reference in which the code is run, this alone does not solve the basic
causality problems raised by such classical models.

with alternating widths. The solution bifurcates from a stationary discrete gap
soliton, and in a regime of large oscillations its intensity oscillates
periodically between having one peak at the central site, and two symmetric
peaks at the neighboring sites with a dip in the middle. Such solutions, termed
'pulsons', are found to exist in continuous families ranging arbitrarily close
both to the anticontinuous and continuous limits. Furthermore, it is shown that
they may be linearly stable also in a regime of large oscillations.

$v_{2}$. Moreover, higher-order parton anisotropic flows are nonnegligible and
satisfy the scaling relation $v_{n,q}(p_{T})\sim v_{2,q}^{n/2}(p_{T})$, which
leads naturally to the observed similar scaling relation among hadron

  accepted to the North Pacific Acoustic Laboratory (NPAL) Special Section in
  the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America",,,,"physics.ao-ph nlin.CD",,"  Acoustic wave fields propagating long ranges through the ocean are refracted
by the inhomogeneities in the ocean's sound speed profile. Intuitively, for a
given acoustic source frequency, the inhomogeneities become ineffective at
refracting the field beyond a certain fine scale determined by the acoustic
wavelength. On the other hand, ray methods are sensitive to infinitely fine
features. Thus, it is possible to complicate arbitrarily the ray dynamics, and
yet have the wave field propagate unchanged. This feature raises doubts about
the ray/wave correspondence. Given the importance of various analyses relying
on ray methods, a proper model should, at a minimum, exclude all of the fine
structure that does not significantly alter the propagated wave field when the
correspondence to the ray dynamics is integral. We develop a simple, efficient,
smoothing technique to be applied to the inhomogeneities - a low pass filtering
performed in the spatial domain - and give a characterization of its necessary
extent as a function of acoustic source frequency. We indicate how the
smoothing improves the ray/wave correspondence, and show that the so-called
``ray chaos'' problem remains above a very low frequency (about 15-25 Hz).

theoretically. However, the microscopic mechanism of the processive movement of
kinesin is still an open question. In this paper, we propose a hand-over-hand
model for the processivity of kinesin, which is based on chemical, mechanical,
and electrical couplings. In the model the processive movement does not need to
rely on the two heads' coordination in their ATP hydrolysis and mechanical
cycles. Rather, the ATP hydrolyses at the two heads are independent. The much
higher ATPase rate at the trailing head than the leading head makes the motor
walk processively in a natural way, with one ATP being hydrolyzed per step. The
model is consistent with the structural study of kinesin and the measured
pathway of the kinesin ATPase. Using the model the estimated driving force of ~
5.8 pN is in agreements with the experimental results (5~7.5 pN). The
prediction of the moving time in one step (~10 microseconds) is also consistent
with the measured values of 0~50 microseconds. The previous observation of
substeps within the 8-nm step is explained. The shapes of velocity-load (both
positive and negative) curves show resemblance to previous experimental
results.

myosin superfamily that move processively along helical actin filaments in
opposite directions. Here we present a hand-over-hand model for their
processive movements. In the model, the moving direction of a dimeric molecular
motor is automatically determined by the relative orientation between its two
heads at free state and its head's binding orientation on track filament. This
determines that myosin V moves toward the barbed end and myosin VI moves toward
the pointed end of actin. During the moving period in one step, one head
remains bound to actin for myosin V whereas two heads are detached for myosin
VI: The moving manner is determined by the length of neck domain. This
naturally explains the similar dynamic behaviors but opposite moving directions
of myosin VI and mutant myosin V (the neck of which is truncated to only
one-sixth of the native length). Because of different moving manners, myosin VI
and mutant myosin V exhibit significantly broader step-size distribution than
native myosin V. However, all three motors give the same mean step size of 36
nm (the pseudo-repeat of actin helix). Using the model we study the dynamics of
myosin V quantitatively, with theoretical results in agreement with previous
experimental ones.

means to understand the nature of quantum algorithmic speedups. Since quantum
gates that do not preserve the computational basis are necessary for achieving
quantum speedups, it appears natural to define the quantumness of a quantum
circuit using the number of such gates. Intuitively, a reduction in the
quantumness requires an increase in the amount of classical computation, hence
giving a ``quantum and classical tradeoff''.
  In this paper we present two results on this direction. The first gives an
asymptotic answer to the question: ``what is the minimum number of
non-basis-preserving gates required to generate a good approximation to a given
state''. This question is the quantum analogy of the following classical
question, ``how many fair coins are needed to generate a given probability
distribution'', which was studied and resolved by Knuth and Yao in 1976. Our
second result shows that any quantum algorithm that solves Grover's Problem of
size n using k queries and l levels of non-basis-preserving gates must have
k*l=\Omega(n).

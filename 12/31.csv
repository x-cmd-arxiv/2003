brown dwarfs or planets we investigate possible scenarios that can account for
the spiral structure in circumstellar disks. We consider two scenarios, spiral
structure driven by an external bound planet or low mass star and that excited
by a previous stellar close encounter or flyby. We find that both scenarios
produce morphology similar to that observed in the outer disks of HD 141569A
and HD 100546; moderately open 2-armed outer spiral structure. The outer
two-armed spiral structure observed in the disk of HD 141569A is qualitatively
reproduced with tidal perturbations from its companion binary HD 141569B,C on a
prograde orbit near periapse. Our simulation accounts for the outer spiral
arms, but is less successful than the secular model of Augereau and Papaloizou
at matching the lopsidedness or asymmetry of the disk edge at 300AU. The disk
has been previously truncated by the tidal force from the binary. A bound
object (stellar or planetary) is unlikely to explain the spiral structure in HD
100546. A co-eval planet or brown dwarf in the disk of sufficient mass to
account for the amplitude of the spiral structure would be detectable in NICMOS
and STIS images, however existing images reveal no such object. A previous
encounter could explain the observed structure, provided that the encounter
occurred less than a few thousand year ago. The object responsible for causing
the spiral structure must then be within a few arcminutes of the star. However,
the USNO-B proper motion survey reveals no candidate object. Moreover, the
probability that a field star encountered HD 100546 in the past few thousand
years is very low.

code for general-relativistic hydrodynamics. Using Fourier transforms at
several points inside the star, both the eigenfrequencies and two-dimensional
eigenfunctions of pulsations are extracted. The centrifugal forces and the
degree of differential rotation have significant effects on the
mode-eigenfunction. We find that near the mass-shedding limit, the pulsations
are damped due to shocks forming at the surface of the star. This new damping
mechanism may set a small saturation amplitude for modes that are unstable to
the emission of gravitational waves. After correcting for the assumption of the
Cowling approximation (used in our numerical code), we construct empirical
relations that predict the range of gravitational-wave frequencies from
quasi-periodic post-bounce oscillations in the core collapse of massive stars.
We also find that the fundamental quasi-radial mode is split, at least in the
Cowling approximation and mainly in differentially rotating stars, into two
different sequences.

different gravity solvers and fundamentally different approaches to
hydrodynamics. We compare the GADGET `entropy conserving' SPH formulation with
two ENZO methods: The piecewise parabolic method (PPM), and the artificial
viscosity-based scheme used in the ZEUS code. In this paper we focus on a
comparison of cosmological simulations that follow either only dark matter, or
also adiabatic baryonic gas. The dark matter-only runs agree generally quite
well, provided ENZO is run with a comparatively fine root grid and a low
overdensity threshold for mesh refinement, otherwise the abundance of low-mass
halos is suppressed. This is due to the hierarchical particle-mesh method used
to compute gravitational forces in ENZO, which tends to deliver lower force
resolution than the tree algorithm of GADGET. At comparable force resolution,
we find that the latter offers substantially better performance and lower
memory consumption than the present gravity solver in ENZO. In simulations that
include adiabatic gas dynamics, we find general agreement in the distribution
functions of temperature, entropy, and density for gas of moderate to high
overdensity, as found inside dark matter halos. However, there are some
significant differences at lower overdensities. We argue that these
discrepancies are presumably owing to differences in the shock-capturing
abilities of the different methods. In particular, ZEUS hydro leads to some
unphysical heating at early times in preshock regions. Overall, the GADGET
hydro results are bracketed by those for ENZO/ZEUS and ENZO/PPM. (abridged)

lognormal (LN) model of cosmic clustering. We show that the thermal history of
the universe around the reionization can roughly be divided into three epochs:
1) cold dark age $z>z_r$, in which baryon gas is neutral, and opaque to
Ly$\alpha$ photons; 2) hot dark age $z_r > z> z_{gp}$, in which a predominant
part of baryon gas is ionized and hot, but it is still opaque to Ly$\alpha$
photons; 3) bright age $z<z_{gp}$, in which the universe is ionized highly
enough to be transparent to Ly$\alpha$ photons. In the flat cold dark matter
cosmological models given by WMAP and COBE, the difference of the two redshifts
$z_r - z_{gp}$ is found to be as large as $\sim 10$ with $z_r\sim 17$ and
$z_{gp}\sim 7$. This reionization history naturally yields a high optical depth
to the CMB $\tau_e \simeq 0.12 - 0.19$ observed by the TE polarization of the
WMAP, and a low redshift $z_{gp}$ of the appearance of the Ly$\alpha$
Gunn-Peterson trough $z_{gp} \simeq 6 - 8$ in QSO's absorption spectra. The
reason why the universe stays long in an ionized, yet Ly$\alpha$ opaque, stage
is because the first photo-ionization heats the intergalactic gas effectively
and has balanced the gravitational clustering a long period of time. Therefore,
the result of a high $\tau_e$ and low $z_{gp}$ is a common feature of all the
models considered. Besides the cosmological parameters, the only free parameter
we used in the calculation is $N_{ion}$, the mean ionization photons produced
by each baryon in collapsed objects. We take it to be 40 - 80 in the

and width of the broad emission lines. To remove the Fe II contribution in

such a template.
  I Zw 1 is a bright narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy. As such it is well suited
for a detailed analysis of its emission line spectrum. Furthermore it is known
to have a very peculiar spectrum with, in addition to the usual broad and
narrow line regions, two emission regions emitting broad and blue shifted [O
III] lines making it a peculiarly interesting object. While analysing the
spectra, we found that the narrow-line region is, unlike the NLR of most
Seyfert 1 galaxies, a very low excitation region dominated by both permitted
and forbidden Fe II lines. It is very similar to the emission spectrum of a
blob in $\eta$ Carinae which is a low temperature (T$_{\rm e}\sim$6 500 K),
relatively high density (N$_{\it e}$=10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) cloud. The Fe II lines
in this cloud are mainly due to pumping via the stellar continuum radiation
field (Verner et al. \cite{verner02}). We did not succeed in modelling the
spectrum of the broad-line region, and we suggest that a non radiative heating
mechanism increases the temperature in the excited H I region, thus providing
the necessary additional excitation of the Fe II lines. For the low-excitation
narrow-line region, we are able to settle boundaries to the physical conditions
accounting for the forbidden and permitted Fe II lines (10$^{6}$$<$N$_{\rm
e}$$<10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$; 10$^{-6}$$<$U$<10^{-5}$).

cosmos took place: What is the relativistic line element describing the energy
density and pressure of such a pre-existing universal background? The simplest
conceivable ansatz leads to a Stationary-Universe Model (SUM), which instead of
the 'Steady-state Theory' is shown to be an arguable alternative to the
Cosmological Concordance Model (CCM) commonly accepted today. The SUM stands
out with redshift values statistically independent of time; a significant
Hubble parameter is proved in contrast to the conventional one. It requires a
negative gravitational 'dark' pressure of -1/3 the critical density. Intrinsic
limitations of proper length and time are derived, which cause a struggle of
local SRT (quantum mechanics) and universal GRT (gravitation). Using one
macroscopic constant H in addition to c and G only, the model describes a
background free of coincidences or horizon problems. While the CCM's key
parameter Omega_Lambda seems determined by SUM 'boundary' conditions, there is
a chance of having already observed parts of a stationary universe: With no
need for 'dark energy', this alternative explains straightforwardly the SNe-Ia
data on universal scales. In addition to its currently assumed parts, a
non-lensing homogeneous background of matter might fill the gap to critical
density. A mathematical solution for a perfect black-body spectrum composed of
redshifted microwave radiation emitted from 'dark' sources within the universe
is derived; thus the CMB might exist as a special part of the extragalactic
background light. Given the law of entropy restricted to evolutionary
processes, an open concept is revealed to imply a 'chaotic' quasi-inflation
background, embedding 'local-bang' cosmoses therein. - The SUM is shown to be
the only arguable solution of Einstein's original equations without
cosmological constant.

finite volume calculation for non self-avoiding loops is presented. This model,

driven by liquidity fluctuations, variations in the market's ability to absorb
new orders. Even for the most liquid stocks there can be substantial gaps in
the order book, corresponding to a block of adjacent price levels containing no

the best quote, triggering a large midpoint price change. Thus, the

theory in two dimensions. As in previous studies this procedure requires an
accurate targeting of various excited states. Here we discuss how this can be
achieved within the DMRG algorithm by means of the recently proposed

spin-1 Hamiltonian with special attention to the transitions from the Haldane

conjunction with k.p perturbation theory to develop a multi-band effective-mass

the same order as the position dependence of the effective mass, the quadratic

both of which are diagonal in the effective-mass Hamiltonian. Long-range
multipole Coulomb fields arise in quantum wires or dots, but have no

model for earthquakes [Physica A \textbf{270}, 27 (1999)] which considers a
pairof dynamically overlapping finite generations of the Cantor set as a
prototype of geological faults. In this model the $n$-th generation of the
Cantor set shifts on its replica in discrete steps of the length of a line
segment in that generation and periodic boundary conditions are assumed. We
determine the general form of time sequences for the constant magnitude
overlaps and hence obtain the complete time-series of overlaps by the
superposition of these sequences for all overlap magnitudes. From the
time-series we derive the exact frequency distribution of the overlap
magnitudes. The corresponding probability distribution of the logarithm of
overlap magnitudes for the $n$-th generation is found to assume the form of the
binomial distribution for $n$ Bernoulli trials with probability 1/3 for the
success of each trial. For an arbitrary pair of consecutive overlaps in the
time-series where the magnitude of the earlier overlap is known, we find that
the magnitude of the later overlap can be determined with a definite
probability; the conditional probability for each possible magnitude of the
later overlap follows the binomial distribution for $k$ Bernoulli trials with
probability 1/2 for the success of each trial and the number $k$ is determined
by the magnitude of the earlier overlap. Though this model does not produce the
Gutenberg-Richter law for earthquakes, our results indicate that the fractal
structure of faults admits a probabilistic prediction of earthquake magnitudes.

a framework with both the Planck scale and the speed-of-light scale as
characteristic scales of a deformation of the Lorentz transformations. For the

corresponding analysis for the doubly-special-relativity framework. We find
that the analyses of photon stability, synchrotron radiation, and threshold

has its counterpart in the generalized statistical mechanics. Both parameters
offer a number of merits: they are dimensionless, varying over the interval
from 0 to 1/4 and assuming in this interval a discreet series of values.
Besides, their definitions contain all the fundamental constants. These
parameters are very small for the conventional scales and temperatures, e.g.
the value of the first parameter is on the order of $\approx 10^{-66+2n}$,
where $10^{-n}$ is the measuring scale and the Planck scale $\sim 10^{-33}cm$
is assumed. The second one is also too small. It is demonstrated that relative
to the first of these parameters the Universe may be considered as a nonuniform
lattice in the four-dimensional hypercube with dimensionless finite-length
(1/4)edges. And the time variable is also described by one of the
above-mentioned dimensions due to the second parameter and generalized

all projectors of the star-algebra which factorize into projectors for each

number-homogeneous squeezed state projectors, we find a single class of

elaborate on sufficient and necessary conditions which have to be fulfilled by
our projectors in order to constitute surface states. As a byproduct we find
that the full star product of N=2 string field theory translates into a
canonically normalized continuous tensor product of Moyal-Weyl products up to
an overall normalization. The divergent factors arising from the translation to
the continuous basis cancel between bosons and fermions in any even dimension.

charge conservation is not respected. Such a decay would cause vacancy in
closed shells of atoms giving rise to emission of x-rays and Auger electrons.
Experimental searches for such very rare decay have given an estimate for the
life time to be greater than $2.7 \times 10^{23}$ years. The simplest
theoretical model which would give rise to such a decay is one where the
electron is regarded as the first excited state and neutrino as the ground
state of a fundamental spin 1/2 particle bound to a scalar particle by a super
strong force and the photon is considered as a bound state of a fundamental
spin 1/2 fermion-antifermion pair. The fine structure constant of the super
strong coupling is found to be unity from the masslessness of the neutrino and
the lower bound of the mass of the fundamental particles is estimated by using
quantum mechanical formula for photon emission by atoms and found to be
$10^{22}$ GeV from the bound for electron decay time indicating thereby that
the composite nature of electron, neutrino and the photon would be revealed in
the Planckian energy regime. A model based on extension of $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$
symmetry of Dirac equation to $SU(3)\otimes SU(3)$ gives a lower bound for the
mass of the gauge boson mediating the decay to be $10^9 GeV$ which is the
geometric mean of the masses of the electron and the fundamental particles.

Eisenbud, Reeves and Totaro on which Tor groups vanish. In addition, we show

free resolution of $\field$ over $\field[\Lambda]$ which achieves these bounds.
  2. We extend the lexicographic discrete Morse function construction of Babson

complexes of posets to a larger class of facet orderings that includes orders
induced by monomial term orders.
  Since it is known that the order complexes of finite intervals in the poset
of monomials in $k[\Lambda]$ ordered by divisibility in $k[\Lambda ]$ govern
the $\Tor$-groups, the newly developed tools are applicable and serve as the
main ingredients for the proof of the bounds and the construction of the

fluctuating three-dimensional velocity field and significant growth of the flow

compatible with that in a table-top channel in the regime of elastic
turbulence. The chaotic flow leads to quite efficient mixing, which is almost
diffusion independent. For macromolecules, mixing time in this microscopic flow
